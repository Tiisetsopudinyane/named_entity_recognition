While 
the 
use 
of 
telehealth 
was 
common 
in 
hepatitis 
C 
healthcare 
in 
Australia 
in 
remote 
and 
regional 
areas 
prior 
to 
the 
COVID-19 
pandemic, 
it 
has 
been 
used 
more 
broadly 
to 
improve 
access 
to 
hepatitis 
C 
heathcare 
during 
the 
pandemic. Despite its widespread uptake, little research has explored how telehealth shapes hepatitis C health- 
care. In this article, we draw on the concept of aﬀordances (Latour, 2002) and interviews with 25 healthcare 
practitioners to explore the emergent possibilities for hepatitis C care that take shape through telehealth. De- 
spite 
suggestions 
that 
telehealth 
is 
comparable 
to 
in-person 
care, 
healthcare 
practitioners’ 
accounts 
suggest 
that 
telehealth 
signiﬁcantly 
changes 
the 
nature 
of 
their 
experience 
of 
providing 
healthcare 
for 
hepatitis 
C. 
According 
to these service practitioners, while it increased access to hepatitis C healthcare during the pandemic, it also 
aﬀorded 
narrower, 
less 
personal 
healthcare 
encounters, 
with 
a 
focus 
on 
simple 
and 
singular 
issues, 
and 
reduced 
opportunities for communication and rapport. These aﬀordances also discouraged the use of interpreters and 
by 
extension 
the 
inclusion 
of 
patients 
from 
non-English 
speaking 
backgrounds. 
However, 
the 
data 
collected 
also 
suggest that telehealth has the potential to aﬀord more informal and relaxed healthcare environments and dis- 
positions 
between 
healthcare 
practitioners 
and 
patients, 
potentially 
disrupting 
classic 
practitioner-patient 
power 
dynamics. 
In 
concluding, 
the 
article 
considers 
how 
telehealth 
models 
of 
care 
might 
better 
aﬀord 
quality 
hepatitis 
C 
healthcare 
and 
care 
beyond 
COVID-19 
pandemic 
conditions. 
Introduction 
The term ‘telehealth’ refers to the delivery of healthcare remotely 
through telecommunications technology. While the use of telehealth 
was common in hepatitis C healthcare in Australia in remote and re- 
gional areas prior to COVID-19, it has since been used more broadly 
to improve access to hepatitis C healthcare during the pandemic. De- 
spite its widespread uptake across a range of community and special- 
ist settings, little research has explored how telehealth shapes hep- 
atitis C healthcare beyond questions of accessibility and enrolment in 
healthcare. Understanding precisely how telehealth shapes experiences 
of healthcare (and not just access or outcomes), is important as hepati- 
tis C patients, many of whom are people who inject drugs, experience 
marginalisation, disadvantage and stigma. As a result, many consumers 
report feeling apprehensive about the quality of healthcare encounters 
and may not feel entitled to high quality healthcare ( 
Farrugia et al., 
2021 
). Using the concept of aﬀordances ( 
Latour, 2002 
), that is, the ca- 
pacities 
or 
possibilities 
created 
in 
human-technology 
encounters, 
we 
ar- 
gue that despite suggestions that telehealth is comparable to in-person

care, telehealth has the potential to signiﬁcantly change the nature of 
healthcare for hepatitis C and the experiences of practitioners and pa- 
tients involved in hepatitis C healthcare. Paying attention to the aﬀor- 
dances of telehealth is important for developing meaningful and equi- 
table healthcare in settings where virtual and digital healthcare are in- 
creasingly common. 
In conducting our analysis, we consider both telehealth modalities, 
phone 
and 
video 
telehealth, 
distinguishing 
the 
aﬀordances 
and 
implica- 
tions 
of 
each 
where 
relevant. 
Drawing 
on 
interviews 
with 
25 
healthcare 
practitioners who provided hepatitis C healthcare during the COVID- 
19 pandemic, we observe how telehealth can aﬀord more narrowly fo- 
cused 
healthcare 
encounters. 
As 
this 
article 
will 
demonstrate, 
while 
tele- 
health was often described as convenient and simple to use, it was also 
discussed in ways that suggest it aﬀorded less personal healthcare en- 
counters, 
with 
a 
focus 
on 
simple 
and 
singular 
biomedical 
issues, 
and 
re- 
duced opportunities for meaningful communication and rapport. Prac- 
titioners described experiences with both phone and video telehealth 
appointments, 
and 
overall 
said 
both 
aﬀorded 
less 
personal 
healthcare 
in- 
teractions compared with in-person appointments. They also described

telehealth appointments of both kinds as reconﬁguring the timing of 
when healthcare tasks and practices were performed, and as tending 
to discourage pauses and silences in appointments. While video tele- 
health was said to potentially aﬀord meaningful communication, care 
and rapport by including some of the visual information and cues that 
phone telehealth was thought to lack, and providing more opportuni- 
ties for explanation and communication, it was also described as hard 
to manage alongside other digital technologies, computer software, or 
administrative tasks, similarly resulting in more cursory, less-detailed 
appointments. 
As 
we 
will 
also 
see, 
the 
technological 
aﬀordances 
of 
tele- 
health, especially phone telehealth, were said to discourage the use of 
interpreters, who were considered harder to manage in the telehealth 
consultation 
and, 
by 
extension, 
tended 
to 
discourage 
patients 
from 
non- 
English speaking backgrounds from using telehealth. However, we also 
explore 
how 
telehealth 
may 
aﬀord 
positive 
changes 
to 
appointments 
by 
aﬀording more informal and relaxed healthcare environments and dis- 
positions between healthcare practitioners and patients. In concluding 
this 
analysis, 
we 
think 
through 
how 
telehealth 
modalities 
might 
encour- 
age 
quality 
hepatitis 
C 
healthcare 
and 
care 
beyond 
COVID-19 
pandemic 
conditions, an important yet often overlooked issue for marginalised 
groups, such as people who inject drugs. 
Background 
In 
Western 
countries, 
hepatitis 
C 
is 
mainly 
associated 
with 
illicit 
drug 
injecting. 
Treatment 
for 
hepatitis 
C 
has 
improved 
signiﬁcantly 
in 
recent 
years 
with 
the 
introduction 
of 
direct-acting 
antiviral 
(DAA) 
medications 
that have far fewer side eﬀects and much higher success rates than past 
treatments. Following the development of DAA hepatitis C treatments, 
the 
World 
Health 
Organization 
announced 
a 
new 
goal 
of 
eliminating 
the 
virus by 2030, which Australia’s Commonwealth government adopted 
(Australian Department of Health, 2018 
) and supported with fully sub- 
sidised DAA treatment via Australia’s Pharmaceutical Beneﬁts Scheme. 
This means DAA treatment has been relatively accessible and aﬀord- 
able in Australia since it became available. Subsidising treatment was 
particularly 
signiﬁcant 
for 
marginalised 
people, 
such 
as 
Indigenous 
peo- 
ple, culturally and linguistically diverse people, and people who inject 
drugs, all of whom are overrepresented among people with hepatitis C, 
already experience high levels of disadvantage and hardship, and face 
extensive social and political barriers to treatment ( 
Hajarizadeh et al., 
2018 
). Notably, people who inject drugs comprise an estimated 39% 
of people globally who have hepatitis C ( 
Degenhardt et al., 2017 
). Af- 
ter an early phase in provision of DAAs that saw promising rates of 
treatment uptake, however, rates have plateaued and even dropped. As 
identiﬁed in Australia’s Fifth National Hepatitis C Strategy 2018 
-2022 
( 
Department of Health, 2018 
), widespread reforms in healthcare deliv- 
ery are needed to improve access to these medications and treatment 
uptake if Australia’s elimination goal is to be met. Telehealth services 
are understood in public health research as one way to improve access 
to hepatitis C healthcare ( 
Keogh et al., 2016 
; Schulz et al., 2020 
), espe- 
cially for people who inject drugs and other marginalised populations 
( 
Schwarz et al., 2022 
; Sivakumar et al., 2022 
). 
Prior 
to 
the 
onset 
of 
COVID-19-related restrictions 
in 
Australia, 
tele- 
health was used for hepatitis C healthcare only in regional, rural and 
prison settings. It was found to be successful in improving patient ac- 
cess to treatment ( 
Bradford et al., 2016 
; Mina et al., 2016 
), especially 
in remote, rural and carceral environments ( 
Halder et al., 2021 
), and 
reducing the ﬁnancial, travel and other material costs associated with 
accessing healthcare ( 
Bradford et al., 2016 
; Schulz et al., 2017 
). Tele- 
health facilitated access to specialist healthcare without requiring pa- 
tients attend tertiary hospitals ( 
Wade et al., 2016 
), and by providing 
access to healthcare in settings without specialist clinics (e.g., pris- 
ons) ( 
Mina et al., 2016 
; Neuhaus et al., 2018 
; Papaluca et al., 2019 
; 
Taylor 
et 
al., 
2018 
). 
During 
the 
early 
stages 
of 
the 
COVID-19 
pandemic, 
the broader utility of telehealth in facilitating access to essential pri- 
mary health services became clear ( 
Anthony, 2021 
; James et al., 2021 
; 
Javanparast, 
2021 
), 
as 
more 
people 
were 
able 
to 
access 
healthcare 
from 
their own homes ( 
Anthony, 2021 
; Searby & Burr, 2021 
; Taylor et al., 
2021 
). To support physical distancing measures and stay-at-home or- 
ders, the Australian Government established and funded new Medicare 
Beneﬁts 
Schedule 
(MBS) 
telehealth 
item 
numbers, 
so 
that 
patients 
could 
use Medicare to access essential healthcare services through telehealth 
at minimal or no cost. This resulted in hepatitis C healthcare being 
made available beyond specialist settings through telehealth consulta- 
tions. 
While 
recent 
research 
indicates 
that 
patients 
reported 
a 
high 
level 
of 
satisfaction 
with 
telehealth 
services 
during 
COVID-19-related 
restric- 
tions ( 
Bensted et al., 2021 
) and that high-quality hepatitis C health- 
care through telehealth is comparable to in-person care ( 
Schultz et al., 
2020 
), little to no research has been conducted into how telehealth 
qualitatively aﬀects the experience of hepatitis C healthcare for prac- 
titioners or patients. In this article, we explore provider experiences of 
these issues in detail through healthcare practitioners’ accounts of de- 
livering hepatitis C healthcare through telehealth during the COVID-19 
pandemic. 
Literature review 
Research on telehealth for hepatitis C healthcare is limited. Mainly 
quantitative in methods, it tends to focus on the analysis of treatment 
outcome 
data 
( 
Bensted 
et 
al., 
2021 
; 
Rodrigues 
et 
al., 
2021 
; 
Schulz 
et 
al., 
2017 
; Shulz et al., 2020 
). This research is oriented towards assessing 
treatment outcomes and cure rates and as a result has largely not ad- 
dressed 
how 
telehealth 
shapes 
the 
provision 
or 
experience 
of 
healthcare 
for hepatitis C. It also does not distinguish between diﬀerent types of 
telehealth (phone- and video-based). To our knowledge, no social re- 
search 
has 
yet 
explored 
how 
telehealth 
shapes 
the 
nature 
and 
experience 
of hepatitis C healthcare. 
While there is little social research on telehealth for hepatitis C 
healthcare, a range of rich studies have been conducted on how tele- 
health 
(sometimes 
referred 
to 
as 
telemedicine 
or 
telecare) 
and 
other 
dig- 
ital care practices shape and reconﬁgure patient-practitioner relation- 
ships 
and 
care 
experiences 
for 
other 
conditions. 
Science 
and 
Technology 
Studies 
scholar 
Nelly 
Oudshoorn’s 
work 
on 
telecare 
for 
heart-failure 
pa- 
tients has been inﬂuential for scholars of telehealth and is useful for 
thinking through how telehealth practices and technology shape hep- 
atitis C healthcare interactions. Signiﬁcantly, Oudshoorn (2009 
, 2011 
) 
argues that changes from in-person care to telehealth care cannot be 
understood in terms of replication. While telehealth technologies are 
often portrayed as neutral mediators, she argues that ‘instead of facil- 
itating care, technologies interact with and shape the ways in which 
bodies and disorders are deﬁned, treated and experienced’ (2009, p. 
391). 
In 
her 
view, 
telehealth 
does 
not 
reproduce 
existing 
forms 
of 
health- 
care but introduces new and diﬀerent forms of care and responsibilisa- 
tion. 
In 
Oudshoorn’s 
ethnographic 
studies, 
she 
observes 
how 
the 
various 
forms of digital and physical proximity enacted in diﬀerent telehealth 
clinics and telemonitoring modalities for heart-failure patients produce 
markedly 
diﬀerent 
care 
arrangements 
(e.g., 
contextualised 
personalised 
care versus individualised immediate care). These diﬀerences have sig- 
niﬁcant constitutive eﬀects for the enactment of heart failure as illness 
or disease. 
Other sociological research has also explored the question of how 
telehealth technologies intervene in and shape healthcare relationships 
and responsibilities. In Pols & Willems’ (2011) study of telecare tech- 
nology for people with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(COPD), they argue that the telecare provided to patients exceeded the 
local policy goals assigned to it and needed to be ‘tinkered’ with in lo- 
cal settings to ﬁt the practices of users. This process of ‘implementa- 
tion’ and ‘tinkering’ changed care practices and relationships between 
carers, clinics and patients in unforeseen ways. Signiﬁcantly, as they 
argued, it is not only the care relations between professionals and pa- 
tients that are remade through telehealth, but relationships between 
professionals too. Writing much later on COPD, Nickelsen (2019) ar-

gues that the infrastructure of telehealth reconstituted medical respon- 
sibility for care to nurses in settings where they were not aﬀorded the 
clinical 
decision-making 
responsibilities 
of 
doctors. 
Telecare, 
with 
its 
ca- 
pacities for surveillance and monitoring (e.g., remote monitoring), also 
contributes to the enactment of new healthcare spaces and a blurring 
of boundaries between the public and private ( 
Milligan et al., 2011 
; 
Oudshoorn, 2011 
). Importantly, in addition to modifying relations of 
care and responsibility, telehealth also has the capacity to produce new 
aﬀective resonances, such as intimacy ( 
Piras & Miele, 2019 
), and sen- 
sory 
capacities 
and 
competencies 
in 
clinical 
interactions 
and 
judgements 
( 
Lupton & Maslen, 2017 
). This research emphasises that telehealth is 
not 
just 
a 
communication 
tool 
but, 
through 
its 
engagements 
in 
diﬀerent 
healthcare settings, is also an active participant in creating and sustain- 
ing 
subjectivities, 
relationships 
and 
social 
worlds. 
As 
we 
describe 
below, 
we build on this research through the concept of ‘aﬀordances’, which 
has recently been used to explore these kinds of issues in critical drug 
scholarship. 
Technological aﬀordances 
To draw out and theorise the novel meanings and actions generated 
by telehealth in hepatitis C care, we turn to the concept of aﬀordance 
( 
Latour, 2002 
; Davis, 2020 
), which has been mobilised productively in 
the study of technologies and digital healthcare in critical drug schol- 
arship. The concept of aﬀordance originated in the work of ecological 
psychologist 
James 
Gibson 
(1979) 
to 
explore 
the 
mutual 
constitution 
of 
people and environments and was later the subject of Donald A. Nor- 
man’s work in design studies (for more detail, see Davis, 2020 
; Dilkes- 
Frayne et al., 2019 
; Farrugia et al., 2019 
). However, it is Latour’s ap- 
proach to the morality of technological objects and creation of ‘aﬀor- 
dances’ that has been most inﬂuential in critical drug studies, enabling 
the theorisation of novel relations generated in engagements with the 
injecting ﬁtpack ( 
Fraser, 2013 
), take-home naloxone ( 
Farrugia et al., 
2019 
; Farrugia et al., 2020 
), online counselling and ‘chatbots’ for alco- 
hol and other drug problems ( 
Barnett et al., 2021 
; Dilkes-Frayne et al., 
2019 
) and long-acting depot buprenorphine ( 
Barnett et al., 2021 
). In 
critical drug scholarship, the concept of aﬀordance has been used to 
challenge 
overly 
deterministic 
accounts 
of 
the 
relationship 
between 
sub- 
jects and objects (e.g., where subjects merely use objects according to 
the pre-determined capacities of those objects), as well as the converse 
notion 
that 
objects 
and 
technologies 
are 
passive 
tools 
for 
pre-determined 
social practice. 
As has been covered elsewhere ( 
Davis, 2020 
; Farrugia et al., 
2019 
; Farrugia et al., 2020 
; Fraser, 2013 
; Fraser et al., 2017 
), for 
Latour (2002) 
, technological objects, such as the ones listed above, are 
not neutral, empty vessels, nor deterministic dictators of outcomes. In- 
stead they embody material and political elements and histories, and 
speciﬁc moral dispositions and attachments, and articulate intentions 
for 
behaviour 
and 
conduct. 
Through 
their 
complex 
engagements 
in 
prac- 
tice with subjects, various actions, relations, moralities and even sub- 
jectivities are enunciated and brought into being. This process is de- 
scribed as the ‘permission and promise’ of a technology ( 
Latour, 2002 
, 
p. 250). Signiﬁcantly, if technologies are not understood as neutral in- 
struments, 
their 
relationships 
with 
subjects 
are 
necessarily 
reconﬁgured 
beyond that of passive objects. As Fraser argues, paraphrasing Latour, 
‘all uses of technology create change, or involve translation. In engag- 
ing with technologies, ‘aﬀordances’ are created – capacities and possi- 
bilities at once’ (2013, p. 215). Writing about take-home naloxone, the 
overdose reversal technology, Farrugia et al. (2020) write, ‘aﬀordances 
are 
not 
predetermined 
options 
between 
which 
the 
‘user’ 
of 
a 
technology 
may choose, but non-determining possibilities and capacities that take 
shape in encounters between human and technological objects’ (p. 31). 
This notion of aﬀordance is generative for thinking about telehealth, 
which is commonly discussed as simply a means to an end: a communi- 
cations 
technology 
that 
delivers 
cost- 
and 
time-eﬀective 
and 
convenient 
healthcare. In this article, we explore practitioner perspectives on the 
aﬀordances of telehealth that emerge through its adoption in hepati- 
tis C healthcare practices, and conclude by thinking through how these 
aﬀordances 
might 
be 
managed 
to 
improve 
telehealth 
healthcare 
for 
hep- 
atitis C. 
Method 
This 
article 
draws 
on 
interview 
data 
from 
a 
qualitative 
study 
of 
tele- 
health for hepatitis C during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. The 
study was commissioned by the Australian Government Department of 
Health, 
and 
sought 
to 
better 
understand 
the 
beneﬁts, 
limitations, 
and 
ef- 
fects 
of 
the 
use 
of 
telehealth 
for 
hepatitis 
C 
healthcare 
during 
the 
COVID- 
19 pandemic. The study is based on semi-structured interviews with 25 
healthcare practitioners and 15 patients with experience of telehealth 
to provide or receive healthcare for hepatitis C since March 2020. A 
key concern of this project was to investigate the experiences of health- 
care practitioners using telehealth for hepatitis C healthcare during the 
COVID-19 pandemic, and any impediments they identify for sustain- 
ing or enhancing implementation, uptake, engagement and retention. 
To address this aim, in this article, we focus speciﬁcally on healthcare 
practitioners’ perspectives on and experiences of using telehealth. With 
patient perspectives the focus of a previous article developed from this 
project ( 
Shaw et al., 2022 
), here we focus on what healthcare prac- 
titioners understand to be the aﬀordances of telehealth for hepatitis 
C healthcare. Practitioner perspectives provide important insights into 
how they experience telehealth delivery of hepatitis C healthcare, and 
how their practices have been changed by telehealth and COVID-19- 
related restrictions. They also raise important issues and dynamics for 
practitioners that may have the potential to negatively aﬀect quality of 
care. 
Of the 25 healthcare practitioners interviewed for this project, 13 
had experience of both phone and video telehealth (including Zoom, 
Skype and service-speciﬁc telehealth programs), while 12 had expe- 
rience of phone telehealth only. The 25 practitioners were recruited 
through key organisations, snowballing and targeted invitation. They 
comprised GPs (n = 5); specialists such as hepatologists, infectious dis- 
ease specialists, sexual health clinicians or gastroenterologists (n = 8); 
nurses (n = 8); harm reduction workers (n = 2); and others involved in 
hepatitis 
C 
care 
(n 
= 
2). 
Given 
the 
epidemiology 
and 
politics 
of 
hepatitis 
C 
in 
Australia 
( 
Fraser, 
2011 
), 
working 
with 
people 
who 
have 
hepatitis 
C 
involves working with marginalised populations. Nearly all of those we 
interviewed 
described 
working 
with 
people 
with 
a 
history 
of 
alcohol 
and 
other drug use. Many had been working in or with collaboration with 
alcohol 
and 
other 
drug 
support 
and 
health 
services 
or 
blood-borne 
virus 
prevention for many years and expressed an interest in supporting the 
health and wellbeing of people who inject drugs. The semi-structured 
interview schedules on which the interviews were based were devel- 
oped with reference to the existing literature, stakeholder consultations 
and study aims. Healthcare practitioner interviews explored the eﬀects 
of COVID-19-related restrictions on professional practice, knowledge of 
telehealth 
for 
hepatitis 
C 
care 
delivery, 
experiences 
of 
telehealth 
for 
hep- 
atitis C care delivery, key professional issues and telehealth access and 
uptake. All participants were emailed an information sheet describing 
the aims of the study prior to the interview and/or had the aims ver- 
bally summarised and explained at the start of the interview. All par- 
ticipants provided verbal audio-recorded consent at the beginning of 
the interview. The interviews were transcribed, checked for accuracy 
and de-identiﬁed, with all participants assigned pseudonyms to protect 
their 
identities. 
The 
de-identiﬁed 
transcripts 
were 
entered 
into 
NVivo 
12 
qualitative data management software. Analysis proceeded using an it- 
erative

Analysis 
Telehealth was originally developed to overcome geographical dis- 
tance or remoteness ( 
Gajarawala & Pelkowski, 2021 
), an issue that is 
known to be a signiﬁcant barrier to accessing healthcare. In this re- 
gard, many of the healthcare practitioners we interviewed described 
how telehealth aﬀorded the aims articulated in its design. For exam- 
ple, both Ian (GP, Vic) and Ryan (Specialist, Vic) said that telehealth 
reduces travel time and costs, thereby removing geographical and ﬁ- 
nancial barriers, and improves healthcare access for ‘hard to engage’ 
people 
and 
‘lower 
socio-economic 
population[s]’. 
Other 
healthcare 
prac- 
titioners noted similar conveniences: telehealth was easier for patients 
to access and allowed patients to accommodate hepatitis C care within 
everyday activities and responsibilities, such as child-care, exercise and 
work. However, alongside these improvements in accessibility, the in- 
terviews 
also 
suggest 
signiﬁcant 
changes 
in 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
healthcare 
interaction in hepatitis C healthcare, an issue that has received much 
less attention in the literature. Below, we explore the aﬀordances of 
telehealth for hepatitis C care and healthcare as articulated by health- 
care practitioners. We begin by exploring some aﬀordances that might 
be understood together as having the potential to produce more nar- 
rowly focused healthcare interactions, which were briefer in duration 
and concentrated on simple and singular biomedical issues. We then 
consider how narrower healthcare interactions may aﬀord less equi- 
table 
healthcare 
for 
people 
from 
culturally 
and 
linguistically 
diverse 
and 
non-English speaking backgrounds. Following this, we explore a diﬀer- 
ent aﬀordance of telehealth as experienced by practitioners: less formal 
health care environments and dispositions. We conclude with a discus- 
sion of how these aﬀordances might be managed to improve telehealth 
healthcare for hepatitis C. 
Narrowing healthcare interactions 
Below 
we 
consider three interconnected changes 
in 
healthcare prac- 
tice for hepatitis C healthcare that participants described as aﬀorded 
by telehealth: 1) a shift to less personal interactions; 2) a greater focus 
on singular and simple health issues; and 3) reduced opportunities for 
communication and rapport. As noted above, more than half of those 
we interviewed regularly used both telehealth modalities: phone and 
video. As noted at the outset, our analysis considers both modalities, 
distinguishing the aﬀordances and implications of each where relevant. 
In their responses participants identiﬁed both as limiting healthcare in- 
teractions, but with phone telehealth especially likely to do so in that it 
discouraged the use of important communication and care conventions 
(e.g., visual information and cues). As we argue, this narrowing of the 
healthcare interaction in hepatitis C healthcare has eﬀects not only on 
the experience of healthcare itself, but on who is more readily given 
access to treatment. 
Less personal interactions 
Several practitioners we interviewed explained that, for them, tele- 
health, especially phone telehealth, had the potential to create less per- 
sonal interactions, generating less informal conversation and oﬀering 
less hospitality ( 
Fraser et al., 2020 
). Beth, a specialist from Victoria, 
suggested that the absence of physical examination in phone telehealth 
made communication ‘faster’ and reduced the opportunity for ‘general 
conversation’. 
Kevin 
(Specialist, 
QLD) 
also 
explained 
that 
in 
phone 
tele- 
health appointments the ‘social niceties that would otherwise occur in 
face-to-face interactions’ are lost, while Benjamin (Specialist, VIC) said 
he was inclined to ‘cut to the chase’ in both phone and video telehealth 
appointments to focus on ‘crucial’ decisions and administrative issues: 
I guess […] because we’re spending less time with people, you sort of 
cut to the chase. You spend some time reading the referral properly, less 
time sort of getting to know people […and on the] general exchange of 
pleasantries, and more time making the crucial decisions, which are, you 
know, what medications does someone take, do they want treatment, do 
they know much about treatment, do they have liver disease? And where 
are they going to get the medication from when I write this prescription? 
[Also…] where am I faxing it to? So [the focus becomes] just sort of the 
crucial decisions and the nuts and bolts of starting treatment. 
There 
was 
a 
sense 
across 
the 
interviews 
that 
telehealth 
led 
to 
briefer 
and more impersonal healthcare interactions. Although none of the 
comments quoted here suggest an explicit reason for this brevity, they 
do suggest that telehealth aﬀords diﬀerent professional conduct, tend- 
ing to make general conversation and ‘social niceties’ less common 
while prioritising biomedical and administrative issues. As we noted 
in an earlier article based on the same research project ( 
Shaw et al., 
2022 
), patients also spoke about how telehealth impeded personal dis- 
closure, especially when they did not have a pre-existing relationship 
with 
the 
practitioner. 
They 
also 
described 
telehealth 
as 
creating 
less 
de- 
tailed 
and 
engaged 
encounters 
over 
time. 
This 
eﬀect 
was 
not 
necessarily 
considered a disadvantage. Because of previous experiences of stigma 
and discrimination, patients sometimes spoke of valuing briefer health- 
care encounters, with brevity and anonymity sometimes perceived as 
supporting privacy. However, both practitioners and patients noted 
that this lack of physical proximity impeded deeper connection and 
familiarity. 
Other practitioners, however, did provide further detail about why 
telehealth 
can 
aﬀord 
more 
impersonal 
healthcare 
interactions. 
The 
com- 
ments below suggest that telehealth alters the substantive practices of 
appointments and, as a result, inhibit opportunities for communication 
and 
care. 
Some 
practitioners 
noted 
that 
both 
phone 
and 
video 
telehealth 
reconﬁgured 
the 
timing 
of 
when 
healthcare 
tasks 
and 
practices 
were 
per- 
formed. Whereas practitioners may have previously familiarised them- 
selves with a patient’s history and health issues, or completed referrals 
and prescriptions, during an in-person appointment, they tended to do 
this work outside of the telehealth appointment. As a result, telehealth 
often 
reduced 
or 
disposed 
of 
pauses 
or 
silences 
in 
appointments. 
As 
sug- 
gested 
below, 
this 
‘downtime’ 
was 
often 
described 
as 
a 
quiet 
period 
that 
could elicit more open and ﬂexible communication not driven by im- 
mediate health issues or practical concerns. As Belinda (Nurse, NSW) 
explains: 
[During 
in-person 
appointments, 
I 
often 
pause 
to 
ﬁll 
in 
a 
form. 
This 
down- 
time can be useful because] they’ll go, ‘Oh, and by the way, you know, 
my dad is worried about catching hep C,’ or, you know, ‘He’s worried 
about 
sharing 
the 
same 
food.’ 
So, 
then 
you’d 
be 
able 
to 
have 
that 
conver- 
sation. But often I’d be on the phone and say, ‘I’m going to send you the 
form,’ and then I’d have my downtime afterwards, so there wasn’t that 
gap. 
So 
[…while] 
I’ll 
often 
ask 
them, 
‘Do 
you 
have 
any 
questions?’ 
[they 
will 
say] 
‘No. 
No. 
It’s 
all 
good.’ 
And 
same 
with 
the 
tele-video 
platform 
as 
well. It was, you know, very much, you didn’t get that downtime and, I 
guess, 
that’s 
where 
sometimes 
the 
really 
interesting 
conversations 
come 
up 
or the really interesting questions come up, and there wasn’t that space. 
Similarly, 
Anthony 
(GP, 
NSW) 
describes 
challenges 
in 
managing 
and 
navigating the telehealth technology alongside other digital programs, 
which resulted in more cursory, less-detailed appointments. In partic- 
ular, he describes video telehealth as ‘abbreviating’ the healthcare en- 
counter: 
Yeah, it [video telehealth] abbreviates it. So, it gives less attention to the 
human aspects of the consultation [while I’m] also juggling around stuﬀ. 
So often [in an in-person appointment, I] will be ﬂicking through pages, 
so there might be pages on a computer or pages in notes or something. If 
you 
are 
on 
a 
call, 
you 
don’t 
seem 
to 
do 
that, 
so 
you 
may 
have 
other 
things 
that you would normally look at in the consultation, but you can’t jump 
too 
easily. 
You 
know 
if 
I 
want 
to 
jump 
from 
here 
[Zoom] 
onto 
the 
patient 
and 
then 
onto 
the 
reminder 
systems 
or 
the 
pathology 
or 
reports, 
it 
all 
sort 
of 
breaks 
down. 
So, 
I 
don’t 
think 
that 
you 
get 
the 
depth 
and 
detail 
of 
your 
consultation that you do when you have got patient with you and have

time. 
We 
also 
tend 
to 
work 
faster 
as 
well, 
so 
yeah, 
it 
deﬁnitely 
deteriorates 
the breadth, both the human and the medical detail of consultation. It’s 
not as good. 
As some practitioners note, managing phone telehealth may also 
aﬀord less space and time in the appointment for general conversa- 
tion and for patients to raise issues. Yet for others, such as Anthony, 
the technological aﬀordances of Zoom in particular make it hard to be 
ﬂexible or spontaneous in healthcare appointments. As a result, video 
telehealth can also aﬀord a briefer and more superﬁcial healthcare en- 
counter 
which, 
as 
Anthony 
notes, 
is 
less 
focused 
on 
the 
whole 
person. 
In 
these 
extracts 
we 
begin 
to 
see 
how 
diﬀerent 
telehealth 
technologies 
may 
contribute diﬀerently to creating more impersonal healthcare interac- 
tions as they prompt a redistribution of tasks, which may inadvertently 
inhibit the natural pauses and silences that can emerge in in-person ap- 
pointments and allow more personal conversations. Notably, the condi- 
tions 
(e.g., 
pauses, 
body 
language, 
visual 
cues) 
that 
may 
prompt 
patients 
to be forthcoming about their broader lives and wellbeing are altered 
through both telehealth technologies. Obviously, video telehealth also 
raises issues concerning access and equity for patients, some of whom 
may face hardship or have limited resources, lack access to suitable de- 
vices or technological literacy and may struggle to access video tele- 
health at all. 
Simple and singular issues 
Telehealth 
can 
not 
only 
change 
the 
nature 
of 
interactions 
but 
the 
con- 
tent 
as 
well. 
Healthcare 
practitioners 
note 
that 
interactions 
through 
tele- 
health had the potential to aﬀord a focus on singular, simple health is- 
sues. 
Janet, 
a 
GP 
from 
Victoria 
who 
only 
used 
phone 
telehealth, 
explains 
that using this telehealth modality makes addressing multiple health is- 
sues challenging: 
I 
think 
telehealth, 
telephone 
health, 
[makes] 
it 
diﬃcult 
to 
maybe 
balance 
two or three health issues in the consultation. I ﬁnd it easier to do when 
someone’s there in 
front of 
you. 
So, they might 
have come for 
something, 
or you’ve brought them back for something, and if they’re there in the 
room, 
I 
think 
it’s 
easier 
to 
bring 
in 
a 
second 
topic 
or 
a 
third, 
or 
something 
like that, and that’s where you’re screening for hep C, for example […] 
It’s easier to bring up, I think, face-to-face than on the phone. 
While Janet describes phone telehealth as altering the ‘balance’ of 
the appointment, Tim (Specialist, QLD), explains that phone telehealth 
also aﬀects the ‘ﬂow’, leading to a focus on ‘simple problems’: 
I think [the appointment] doesn’t ﬂow as well as it does when you are in 
face-to-face with somebody. There are some things that lend themselves 
well to telehealth, simple problems, single-issue stuﬀ, but when you have 
got somebody with multi-morbidities it’s diﬃcult, even to the point of 
asking somebody ‘what medication are you on?’ Oftentimes what will 
happen 
in 
a 
face-to-face clinic 
is 
they 
will 
just 
grab 
a 
bag 
out 
of 
their 
bag 
and 
tip 
them 
all 
out 
on 
the 
desk 
and 
then 
you 
are 
going 
through 
them 
all, 
and you can’t do that on telehealth. 
While scholarship on telehealth has suggested it provides quality of 
care comparable to in-person appointments, these extracts from prac- 
titioners suggest that at least in the case of phone telehealth, it may 
aﬀord 
a 
focus 
on 
simple 
and 
singular 
biomedical 
issues, 
limiting 
quality 
of care. In our previous article (Shaw et al., in press), we also explored 
patient experiences of telehealth care relationships. Like practitioners, 
patients 
also 
suggest 
that 
phone 
telehealth 
was 
adequate 
for 
simple 
and 
straightforward health issues but less suitable for complex problems. 
While practitioners often framed their concerns around diﬃculties aris- 
ing from being unable to perform medical examinations, patients ex- 
plained their concerns more in terms of not being understood. As prac- 
titioners have noted, phone telehealth does not provide visual informa- 
tion, 
nor 
does 
it 
oﬀer 
additional 
technological 
functions 
(such 
as 
chat 
or 
text 
boxes) 
or 
modes 
of 
communication 
to 
share 
resources 
or 
secondary 
information 
that 
might 
assist 
in 
the 
discussion 
of 
complex 
health 
issues. 
However, as we explain below, video telehealth also has limitations. 
Given its visual format, it can allow more detailed communication and 
more caring dispositions between healthcare practitioners and patients 
but still inhibit more open and ﬂexible healthcare encounters. 
Anthony 
(GP, 
NSW) 
describes how 
phone 
and 
video 
telehealth 
may, 
over time, marginalise important issues and promote a superﬁcial view 
of complex health phenomena. He explains, ‘eventually you know you 
are missing stuﬀon the margins and, over a long enough time, those 
margins come in and you are actually dealing quite superﬁcially with 
things’. Speaking about hepatitis C speciﬁcally, Benjamin (Specialist, 
Vic), 
who 
uses 
both 
phone 
and 
video 
telehealth, 
suggests 
that 
healthcare 
practitioners need to be careful to not be lulled by the technology into 
a false sense that hepatitis C patients face nothing more than an easy- 
to-address curable disease: 
I think you’ve always got to be careful that, you know, [you] keep an 
open mind and not get too cocky and think, yes, hepatitis C is easy and, 
yeah, 
we 
can 
cure 
it 
and 
move 
on 
[…] 
There’s 
often 
something 
else 
that’s 
perhaps 
more 
important 
than 
hepatitis 
C 
and 
we’ve 
got 
to 
keep 
our 
minds 
open to that and try and pick up on little cues, try not to shut down 
the conversation too quickly and sort of have a low threshold for the 
patient feeling that they can, you know, ask a question on something 
that’s bothering them. 
When read alongside comments where healthcare practitioners de- 
scribe hepatitis C care through telehealth as simple and easy, these 
remarks mirror Oudshoorn’s (2009) ﬁndings that the technological af- 
fordances of telecare have important implications for the enactment of 
health issues. Just as Oudshoorn described how telecare enacted heart 
failure as a disease rather than an illness, these accounts suggest that 
telehealth aﬀords a more singular focus on treatable biomedical issues. 
Through the narrowed aperture of telehealth, ‘simple’ and treatable 
biomedical 
issues 
are 
aﬀorded, 
potentially 
siloed 
from 
other 
health 
con- 
cerns and divorced from the social relationships and forces that shape 
hepatitis C transmission and healthcare. Given many people who ac- 
cess hepatitis C treatment face signiﬁcant marginalisation and barriers 
to treatment, hepatitis C models of care need to be developed that can 
attend eﬀectively to the multiplicity of health concerns and the com- 
plexity of patients’ lives. 
Rapport and communication 
In the previous sections we identiﬁed the potential for telehealth’s 
communication capacities to change the focus and substantive prac- 
tices of hepatitis C treatment. In this section we discuss the capacity of 
telehealth encounters to also aﬀord fewer opportunities for practition- 
ers and patients to build connection and rapport. For example, while 
Tara (Nurse, Vic) is conﬁdent she can provide information about hep- 
atitis 
C 
treatment 
through 
phone 
and 
video 
telehealth, 
she 
is 
less 
certain 
whether she is able to build relationships and develop rapport: 
I 
can 
provide 
[information], 
but 
it’s 
… I 
think 
it’s 
better 
face 
to 
face, 
and 
you get that rapport with a person. And often for the people I see, they’ll 
come in with their partner or a friend […] so you can see them both 
fully and develop a rapport […] So, I think that’s easier face to face, 
and setting up that ﬁrst face to face [appointment] and developing the 
rapport, it actually carries forward any other contact, conversations you 
have as well. 
As Ian, a specialist (Vic), explains, part of the diﬃculty of establish- 
ing 
trust 
and 
rapport 
through 
phone 
and 
video 
telehealth 
is 
the 
absence 
of observable body language and visual feedback. Speaking speciﬁcally 
about issues with video telehealth, he says: 
I think body language is an important component […] you kind of used 
to know in a meeting if you said something [wrong]… did everyone sort 
of just think that was a stupid idea and you could kind of think, ‘Maybe

I won’t go any further with that,’ […] whereas you don’t get that [in a 
Zoom meeting] […] you don’t […] really know whether people are even 
concentrating or whether they’re just, you know, watching Netﬂix on the 
side, or whatever they’re doing. So, I think being able to see people, have 
that body language, and a bit of an idea of their home environment or 
their environment where they are at least can build rapport with them. 
For Ian, body language was important for assessing patients’ under- 
standing 
of 
the 
information 
being 
provided 
and 
for 
allowing 
visual 
feed- 
back on the appropriateness of the information being delivered. But 
while video telehealth might mitigate some of these issues, it also in- 
troduced new complexities where practitioners were uncertain about 
whether patients were paying attention during appointments. 
Josephine, a social worker (NSW), speaks in more detail about why 
physical presence and body language are so crucial to developing close 
and 
caring 
relationships 
with 
patients, 
focusing 
this 
time 
on 
the 
inability 
of the phone to communicate the body language of the practitioner as 
much as that of the patient: 
Empathetic 
facial 
expressions, 
active 
listening, 
yeah, 
those 
kind 
of 
cues…
bodily 
language… that 
you 
can’t 
get 
over 
the 
phone 
[…] 
So 
the 
ability 
to 
sort of nod, lean forward, while someone is saying something that’s very 
diﬃcult for them to say, providing them with that safe feeling that you 
are listening, you are focused on what they are doing by either having 
eye contact […] maybe a touch on the shoulder to reassure somebody 
that’s 
crying, 
giving 
them 
tissues, 
you 
know, 
diﬀerent 
kind 
of 
cues 
to 
say, 
‘I am listening to you, I understand, I am emphasising with you.’ So, 
leaning forward, focusing, maybe even tilting [your] head to the side, 
that positive aﬃrmation, that [suggests] ‘I am understanding what you 
are saying’. It’s easier to do that [in-person] and there is so much more 
positive reinforcements [available] than […] over the phone […] the 
body language is what’s missing. 
Here, the practitioner’s physical gestures and communication are 
seen as crucial to quality healthcare because of their capacity to aﬀord 
engagement 
with 
emotions 
in 
the 
healthcare 
interaction. 
This 
quote 
sug- 
gests that it may be more diﬃcult to establish care in phone telehealth 
because it precludes conventional communication elements often mo- 
bilised to constitute rapport and caring healthcare encounters: physical 
presence and postures, nonverbal signs and cues and facial expressions. 
While 
video 
telehealth 
may 
more 
readily 
aﬀord 
these 
elements, 
the 
par- 
ticular 
kind 
of 
physicality 
or 
presence 
constituted 
through 
video 
is 
often 
still 
encountered 
by 
practitioners 
as 
less 
reliable 
than 
in-person 
interac- 
tions (e.g., patients may be engaging in other activities during appoint- 
ments). 
While 
it 
may 
be 
possible 
to 
provide 
training 
and 
support 
to 
assist 
healthcare 
practitioners 
to 
better 
respond 
to 
and 
manage 
nonverbal 
cues 
and silences, it may be that the narrower interactions aﬀorded in tele- 
health 
also 
point 
to 
a 
broader 
need 
for 
more 
careful 
‘technogeographies’ 
of care ( 
Oudshoorn, 2011 
) that include and embed in-person care. The 
combining of in-person healthcare with telehealth is especially impor- 
tant given the disadvantage and marginalisation experienced by many 
people living with hepatitis C (such as people who inject drugs). 
To sum up these three sections, these accounts suggest that tele- 
health, especially phone telehealth, fundamentally alters interactions 
for hepatitis C healthcare. Signiﬁcantly, these ﬁndings sit in contrast 
with much research on telehealth for hepatitis C healthcare (which 
notably does not distinguish between phone and video appointments) 
that has found that it is comparable in outcomes to in-person care 
( 
Schulz et al., 2020 
; You, 2014 
). Phone and video telehealth do not 
replicate existing forms of hepatitis C healthcare but, as we have seen, 
have 
the 
capacity 
to 
aﬀord 
new 
realities 
of 
healthcare 
in 
diﬀerent 
ways, 
and 
not 
always 
positive 
ones. 
According 
to 
our 
practitioner 
participants, 
telehealth commonly aﬀords briefer healthcare encounters that are less 
personal in tone, and are shaped around simple singular health prob- 
lems. 
Engagements 
with 
telehealth 
modify 
the 
relations 
and 
practices 
of 
hepatitis C healthcare interactions, with healthcare practitioners iden- 
tifying a reshuﬄing of labour that results in fewer pauses or silences 
within appointments and less ﬂexible modes of communication. In par- 
ticular, phone telehealth, with its absence of visual information and 
physical presence, may also aﬀord fewer opportunities for clear com- 
munication 
and 
rapport-building. 
As 
we 
discussed 
earlier, 
these 
ﬁndings 
resonate with patient experiences of how telehealth changes healthcare 
relationships ( 
Shaw et al., 2022 
). Patients explained that the lack of 
physical proximity led to less intimate healthcare encounters, and that 
it 
diminished 
the 
practitioner’s 
sense 
of 
the 
other, 
leading 
to 
a 
tendency 
to limit the process to ﬁxing health problems readily framed as simple 
and straightforward. 
Issues lost in translation 
Importantly, the narrowed focus of these healthcare interactions 
may inadvertently disadvantage some of the most marginalised hep- 
atitis C patients – those from non-English speaking backgrounds. Sev- 
eral 
healthcare 
practitioners 
describe 
how 
telehealth, 
particularly 
phone 
telehealth, made the inclusion of interpreters, and conversations with 
people from non-English speaking backgrounds, less possible and com- 
mon. 
For 
example, 
Kevin 
(Specialist, 
QLD), 
spoke 
about 
the 
diﬃculty 
of 
gauging a patient’s understanding while using interpreters over phone 
telehealth: 
Every so often, [telehealth] can be completely diabolical if you’re trying 
to work with an interpreter on the line as well. So, there are three of 
you in the interaction. [… It is better] if you’ve got an interpreter with 
you in the room so, again, you can kind of have that direct interaction. 
Occasionally, we’ve attempted to do it with the phone interpreters and so 
that’s someone who you don’t know interpreting in the centre, and you 
just don’t know how much of the message is lost in all that translation. 
Tanya (Nurse, NSW) explains pre-booking interpreters who speak 
the appropriate language could create logistical challenges for phone 
appointments. 
Adding 
an 
extra 
person 
to 
the 
appointment 
increased 
the 
likelihood of delays (e.g., if the interpreter or patient did not arrive on 
time, or at all, for the pre-booked appointment) and telecommunica- 
tions connectivity issues. These challenges could result in missed ap- 
pointments 
or 
long 
waiting 
times. 
She 
reﬂects 
that 
because 
of 
these 
chal- 
lenges, ‘there has been not many [… appointments] where we had to 
utilise 
an 
interpreter 
over 
the 
phone’. 
Josephine, 
a 
social 
worker 
(NSW), 
describes her shock at learning that during a peak period of COVID-19 
transmission in NSW, interpreter services would only be available over 
the phone: 
I nearly fell over, just because it’s really hard to have somebody who 
doesn’t speak English, and having to navigate social issues with that per- 
son through an interpreter can be quite challenging. Sometimes my pa- 
tients can get confused, and gauging that through an interpreter is hard. 
I have to speak with the interpreter while the patient is there and ask 
‘Is this patient sounding confused to you or, like, are they able to make 
decisions?’ And that’s sort of an extra challenging aspect of interpreting, 
where you can try and talk with the patient and then you have to then 
gauge by the interpreter whether that patient is sounding like they are 
understanding what I am saying or what the interpreter is saying. 
While 
some 
practitioners 
make 
clear 
that 
phone 
telehealth 
can 
aﬀord 
inﬂexible healthcare encounters that may inadvertently marginalise 
people from non-English speaking backgrounds, Martin, a specialist 
(Vic), explains that video telehealth can oﬀer a diﬀerent outcome in 
that it can help provide valuable visual information and chat functions: 
Having 
done 
both 
[video 
and 
phone 
telehealth], 
I 
much 
prefer 
video 
when 
it works well […] Interpreter consultations work better on video, I ﬁnd, 
than telephone – it can become a bit of a mess [on the phone] – mainly 
because you can actually see someone talking, so not everyone’s jumping 
in at once and it’s easier to understand. And also, [with] video confer- 
encing, 
we 
can 
use 
the 
chat 
function, 
if 
you 
need 
to 
sort 
of 
clarify 
a 
word 
or type something, it’s really handy. Being able to screen-share and show

people their tests is really handy, and if you need to show them, say, 
diagrams of a liver, you can bring it up on the screen, et cetera. 
For Martin, video telehealth technology aﬀords better communica- 
tion and listening, more opportunities for explanation and communica- 
tion and more resources to provide information. 
The issues raised in this section are especially signiﬁcant given 
the high hepatitis C prevalence among people born overseas in Aus- 
tralia ( 
Coppola et al., 2019 
) and the need to remove barriers to health- 
care for this priority group to progress hepatitis C elimination. These 
data suggest that telehealth, particularly the more prevalent and ac- 
cessible phone telehealth, may aﬀord inhospitable ( 
Fraser et al., 2020 
) 
healthcare environments for people from non-English speaking back- 
grounds who have hepatitis C. As we have seen, phone telehealth has 
the potential to discourage healthcare practitioners from using inter- 
preters due to diﬃculties in organisation, understanding and commu- 
nication. Importantly, this is not to suggest that telehealth always or 
only does these things but that, as we also highlight in the conclu- 
sion, without careful engagements in communication and care, prac- 
titioners 
feel 
telehealth 
can 
narrow 
healthcare 
interactions 
in 
unhelpful 
ways. 
Informal healthcare environments and dispositions 
So far, we have explored some aﬀordances of telehealth identiﬁed 
by practitioners that may contribute to more narrowly focused and po- 
tentially inequitable healthcare interactions. In this ﬁnal section we ex- 
plore 
a 
diﬀerent, 
potentially 
more 
positive, 
aﬀordance 
some 
participants 
identiﬁed – that of a more informal and relaxed healthcare environ- 
ment and disposition between practitioners and patients. A large body 
of scholarship has described how healthcare environments instantiate 
unequal power relations between practitioners and patients. Ranging 
from the paternalism inherent in medicine and the doctor-patient rela- 
tionship, in which patients must adopt a ‘sick role’ in order to recover 
or 
become 
well, 
to 
the 
stigmatising 
eﬀects 
of 
medicalisation, 
healthcare 
environments have been criticised as reinforcing power dynamics that 
buttress medical authority and deemphasise patient knowledge, exper- 
tise 
and 
agency 
( 
Timmermans 
& 
Tietbohl, 
2018 
). 
Given 
these 
dynamics, 
healthcare technologies that have the potential to aﬀord more egalitar- 
ian doctor-patient relationships are important ( 
Fraser et al., 2020 
). 
For 
some 
practitioners, 
telehealth 
may 
contribute 
to 
more 
participa- 
tory and egalitarian relationships with patients ( 
Mead & Bower, 2000 
) 
because 
of 
the 
informal 
environments 
and 
practices 
aﬀorded 
during 
tele- 
health. For example, Lisa (Nurse, NSW) describes a phone appointment 
with a patient who was employed as a tow-truck driver. She describes 
how they ‘did a consult while he was sitting in his truck with his feet 
up, 
parked 
in 
a 
ditch 
on 
the 
side 
of 
the 
road 
under 
a 
tree’ 
and 
noted 
that 
‘he was quite relaxed’. Likewise, she explains later in her interview 
that 
during appointments people often move around or smoke cigarettes: 
People 
would 
get 
up 
and 
go 
for 
a 
walk 
around, 
you 
know, 
or 
they’d 
roll 
a 
cigarette while they’re having a chat and stuﬀlike that. So, yeah, it had 
a nice relaxed feel to it too, which I … you know, it took away a lot of 
that formality, you know, with me sitting at a desk and being across the 
desk from somebody. I think people really appreciate it. I know they did. 
As 
has 
been 
noted 
in 
other 
research 
( 
Milligan 
et 
al., 
2011 
), 
telehealth 
may change the landscape of care by collapsing the boundary between 
the home and the institution. This is especially the case for phone tele- 
health 
which 
aﬀords 
ﬂexibility 
and 
mobility. 
As 
we 
explore 
in 
a 
previous 
article from this project (Shaw et al., in press), some patients value the 
informal healthcare settings aﬀorded by this collapse, because they al- 
low for more private and discreet encounters and reduce the possibility 
of engagement in stigmatising healthcare interactions. The potential to 
reduce stigma is signiﬁcant because many people living with the virus 
are stigmatised due to its association with illicit drug injecting. Rose 
(Nurse, 
Vic) 
also 
noted 
that 
people 
were 
‘relaxed 
a 
lot 
more 
[…] 
because 
they’re at home or wherever they are’. Ian, a specialist (Vic), suggests 
that these relaxed healthcare environments have a signiﬁcant eﬀect on 
medical care and the practitioner-patient relationship. In his view, this 
is a ‘diﬀerent way to do medicine’: 
Some people are just walking along [during their appointment] and it’s 
a diﬀerent way to do medicine, you know. We didn’t … some people 
would quite deliberately sort of go out on their afternoon walk while 
they’re doing their telehealth consultation [laughs] and, you know, it’s 
a diﬀerent way to do things and maybe that makes people relaxed and 
familiar and comfortable in their own environment. 
These accounts suggest that, through the enactment of informal 
healthcare environments, phone telehealth aﬀords a diﬀerent disposi- 
tion in the practitioner-patient relationship. While ‘patient-centred’ or 
collaborative paradigms have gained traction as meaningful concepts 
in recent years in discussions of high-quality healthcare ( 
Epstein & 
Street, 2011 
), the doctor-patient relationship is one historically char- 
acterised by power dynamics that reproduce medical authority and a 
paternal approach to healthcare ( 
Timmermans & Tietbohl, 2018 
), not 
least due to the institutional environments in which it is customarily 
conducted. Telehealth may disrupt these existing relations by aﬀord- 
ing mobility and informal healthcare environments that shape new and 
more 
relaxed 
modes 
of 
practitioner-patient 
relating. 
Yet, 
although 
these 
new arrangements may aﬀord or contribute to a more ‘relaxed’ feeling 
in 
healthcare 
encounters, 
some 
healthcare 
practitioners 
describe 
engag- 
ing more eﬀortfully with telehealth to manage this new dynamic. Lisa, 
a nurse (QLD) also found that telehealth had the potential to aﬀord a 
more relaxed and less ‘threatening’ healthcare encounter for patients, 
but describes having to concentrate more in the appointment as a re- 
sult: 
I think you’ve got to really focus. You’ve got to really try. You know, 
you’ve got to really … you know, I know why they call it Zoom because 
you’ve 
really 
got 
to 
Zoom 
in, 
you 
really 
do, 
and 
you’ve 
got 
to 
really 
listen. 
Others say that with the introduction of telehealth they were con- 
cerned that they may overlook important information in the appoint- 
ment and needed to try harder to ‘pick up on little cues’ (Benjamin, 
specialist, Vic). In this sense, while these new environments and dispo- 
sitions may be beneﬁcial for patients in terms of creating more com- 
fortable or private healthcare encounters (Shaw et al., in press), ensur- 
ing responsible and comprehensive healthcare remains a key concern 
for healthcare practitioners. While the achievement of more informal 
or relaxed healthcare encounters may seem at odds with the sense that 
they 
also 
create 
less 
personal 
encounters, 
when 
viewed 
through 
the 
lens 
of systemic stigmatisation, the co-existence of these aﬀordances makes 
sense. 
That 
is, 
for 
patients 
who 
experience 
ongoing 
and 
institutionalised 
stigma and discrimination, less personal healthcare encounters may be 
desirable because they entail less surveillance and scrutiny and aﬀord 
patients more power in deciding on disclosure. Thinking through the 
implications 
of 
the 
multiple 
aﬀordances 
of 
telehealth 
explored 
in 
this 
ar- 
ticle, 
medical 
regulatory 
boards 
and 
professional 
associations 
may 
need 
to provide greater guidance on these issues. Speciﬁcally, attention and 
care should be given to who is responsible or responsibilised if medi- 
cal or other health problems are overlooked due to technologically me- 
diated changes in the capacities of healthcare practitioners to provide 
assured and responsible medical care. 
Conclusion 
Research suggests that people aﬀected by hepatitis C, such as those 
who inject drugs and face social disadvantage and marginalisation for 
this reason or for others, are likely to beneﬁt from the improved access 
to 
hepatitis 
C 
healthcare 
that 
telehealth 
aﬀords. 
However, 
in 
drawing 
on 
the 
perspectives 
and 
experiences 
of 
healthcare 
practitioners, 
we 
have 
ar- 
gued 
in 
this 
article 
that 
the 
use 
of 
telehealth 
needs 
careful 
and 
deliberate 
attention 
to 
ensure 
meaningful 
and 
high-quality 
healthcare.

cle 
we 
have 
mobilised 
Latour’s 
concept 
of 
aﬀordances 
to 
argue 
that 
tele- 
health aﬀords several concerning outcomes: narrower healthcare inter- 
actions 
through 
less 
personal 
healthcare 
delivery; 
a 
focus 
on 
simple 
sin- 
gular biomedical issues; and the inhibition of easy communication and 
rapport. Both phone and video telehealth were described as aﬀording 
faster and briefer healthcare interactions that were in some ways con- 
venient 
for 
practitioners. 
However, 
this 
speed 
also 
discouraged 
valuable 
pauses and silences in 
appointments 
that 
might have provided opportu- 
nities 
for 
rapport-building 
and 
the 
discussion 
of 
more 
complex 
health 
is- 
sues. 
As 
we 
mentioned 
earlier, 
other 
research 
from 
this 
project 
suggests 
that 
these 
concerns 
are 
also 
shared 
by 
patients 
( 
Shaw 
et 
al., 
2022 
). 
While 
video 
telehealth 
included 
useful 
visual 
information 
and 
cues 
that 
phone 
telehealth did not, video technologies aﬀorded other challenges. They 
could 
be 
hard 
to 
manage 
alongside 
other 
digital 
programs 
and 
adminis- 
trative tasks, similarly resulting in more cursory, less-detailed appoint- 
ments. That said, video telehealth technology oﬀered multiple avenues 
for 
communication 
(e.g. 
video 
and 
chat 
functions) 
and 
more 
opportuni- 
ties for explanation and resource-sharing than phone telehealth. 
As we have argued, these changes in healthcare interactions may 
have very direct material eﬀects, such as reducing the presence of 
interpreters, thereby contributing to the exclusion of patients from 
non-English speaking backgrounds, who already face numerous socio- 
political barriers to accessing hepatitis C treatment. We also argued, by 
contrast, that telehealth may aﬀord more informal healthcare environ- 
ments and dispositions between practitioners and patients, which may 
have the positive eﬀect of disrupting the classic practitioner-patient dy- 
namics that sometimes result in stigmatising and marginalising experi- 
ences of healthcare. 
In drawing conclusions on these issues, it is important to keep in 
mind that telehealth models for hepatitis C healthcare were adopted 
rapidly in response to the rise of COVID-19-related restrictions and the 
prospect that care may be signiﬁcantly reduced without it. From this 
point 
of 
view, 
telehealth 
has 
been 
a 
positive, 
if 
imperfect, 
development. 
However, given that the temporary MBS telehealth items for access- 
ing hepatitis C healthcare have been made ongoing, and vaccinations 
have 
rendered 
the 
COVID-19 
virus 
a 
diﬀerent 
health 
concern, 
this 
study 
raises important questions for the place of telehealth within the future 
of hepatitis C healthcare. Given our ﬁndings, perhaps the most impor- 
tant question is how stronger practitioner-patient relationships, a more 
holistic and targeted approach to healthcare, greater opportunities for 
rapport 
and 
care, 
and 
better 
access 
to 
resources, 
such 
as 
interpreters, 
for 
non-English speaking patients can be aﬀorded. Given, as Latour has ob- 
served, technologies are not deterministic, such aﬀordances should not 
be 
out 
of 
reach. 
Perhaps 
most 
obviously, 
video 
telehealth 
appears 
to 
of- 
fer 
practitioners 
much 
better 
tools 
for 
hepatitis 
C 
healthcare 
than 
phone 
telehealth. 
Given 
practitioners 
often 
need 
to 
communicate 
with 
patients 
at 
the 
same 
time 
as 
using 
digital 
technologies 
and 
search 
engines, 
a 
basic 
yet potentially useful modiﬁcation to improve video telehealth encoun- 
ters would be the use of two computer screens by practitioners where 
this is not already happening, so they can communicate with patients 
and 
navigate 
patient 
notes, 
search 
engines 
and 
other 
relevant 
resources. 
Further, with the potential for phone telehealth to narrow healthcare 
interactions in the ways described above, a hepatitis C telehealth care 
model 
may 
be 
preferable 
where 
it 
is 
embedded 
in 
pre-existing 
healthcare 
relationships, and delivered in conjunction with in-person care. As we 
have 
noted 
elsewhere 
( 
Shaw 
et 
al., 
2021 
), 
patients 
typically 
describe 
the 
combination of in-person and telehealth-based care as producing more 
trust, better communication and a more positive experience of health- 
care. 
While 
we 
found 
accounts 
of 
practitioners 
to 
be 
very 
similar 
to 
those 
of patients in describing telehealth for hepatitis C care during the pan- 
demic, further attention to patient concerns and priorities is needed to 
improve telehealth models of care. Further, the multiple aﬀordances of 
diﬀerent telehealth modalities should be considered when designing or 
updating hepatitis C telehealth models and care protocols. If telehealth 
care for hepatitis C is to continue beyond the pandemic, these models 
should aim to support caring conduct and meaningful communication, 
as well as responsible and comprehensive healthcare in non-traditional 
healthcare 
settings. 
As 
we 
have 
noted 
throughout 
this 
article, 
these 
mod- 
iﬁcations and associated attention to caring and meaningful healthcare 
are especially important for marginalised patients, such as those who 
inject drugs, for whom healthcare encounters are often shaped by stig- 
matising social dynamics and power relations.

Oral health constitutes a signiﬁcant public health concern in Sub-Saharan Africa. The pre-
cise burden of oral diseases and the adequacy of oral healthcare provision remain often
unknown. The present study aims to evaluate key components of the healthcare system in
Sudan and the delivery of oral healthcare across eight dimensions: Healthcare System
Framework, Financing, Service Delivery, Epidemiology, Prevention, Personnel, Dental Edu-
cation and Training System, and Health Beneﬁt Package. The evaluation of Sudan’s health-
care
system
and
oral
healthcare
provision
utilizing
the
extended
World
Health
Organization building blocks healthcare systems analysis framework. The evolving health-
care landscape in Sudan is characterized by a transition towards a Bismarckian model, a
shift facilitated by the implementation of a National Health Insurance Fund. In 2018,
Sudan’s total healthcare expenditure surged to 2.4 billion US dollars and dental care
accounted for less than 1% of this ﬁnancial allocation. During the period spanning from
2016 to 2019, there was an expansion in the healthcare infrastructure and utilization rates.
The number of healthcare facilities and hospital admissions respectively increased from
2,083 to 3,578 and from 14,967,113 to 22,455,772, while the registered number of dentists in
2019 reached 8,964. Within the framework of the national healthcare system, medical con-
sultations and emergency treatments are encompassed in the oral health beneﬁt package.
Sudan’s healthcare system grapples with endemic vulnerabilities compounded by recur-
rent political and economic challenges. Nevertheless, strides towards an insurance-based
healthcare system and the upward trend observed in oral healthcare provision and infra-
structure assets offer promising prospects for future generations.

Introduction
Notwithstanding the strides made in management, preven-
tion, and healthcare accessibility, oral diseases persist as a
predominant global health concern. Approximately 3.5 billion
individuals worldwide suffer from oral diseases, constituting
nearly half of the global populace,1 alimenting disproportion-
ately affect marginalized and susceptible demographics. In
Sudan, the healthcare landscape has encountered consider-
able disruptions due to endemic national socioeconomic vul-
nerabilities, political unrest, and civil strife.2 Hindrances and
disparities impede the health system advancement, resulting
in fragmented and underdeveloped oral healthcare provision.
Positioned within the Middle East North Africa region,
Sudan is the third-largest African country. It has a populace
of 45.6 million individuals and contends with challenges
encompassing
a
predominantly
rural
population
and
a
dynamically evolving demographic characterized by an esca-
lating burden of Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs).2-6 Fol-
lowing the National Health Sector Policy (2021-2024), the
country is aspiring to transition into a welfare state and bol-
ster the national healthcare system through the adoption of
Universal Health Coverage (UHC).7

Since the removal of former President Omar al-Bashir in
April 2019, Sudan has undergone a tumultuous political tran-
sition marked by recurrent interim administrations and acute
military conﬂicts leading to signiﬁcant casualties and wide-
spread displacement of civilians. Since mid-April 2023, con-
ﬂict between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid
Support Forces has resulted in an estimated 5.4 million inter-
nally displaced individuals.8 Furthermore, the nation faced
outbreaks of cholera/acute watery diarrhoea, dengue fever,
measles, and malaria, coupled with assaults on medical facil-
ities, shortages of medical supplies, and pervasive insecu-
rity.8 Economic, social, and structural impediments have
hindered the implementation of effective disease control
measures and investments in healthcare infrastructure,
including oral health services.9
In Africa, oral diseases afﬂict over 480 million individuals,
with factors such as limited exposure to preventive measures
and the increased consumption of sugary beverages and
foods exacerbating their prevalence.10-12 Despite the inter-
twined nature of prevalent NCDs and oral diseases, Sudanese
healthcare maintains a division between oral healthcare and
general medical care.13-15 Oral health remains a marginal
problem in most of Africa, resulting in inadequate ﬁnancial
and technical investments that undermine prevention, treat-
ment, and health promotion efforts.16 In particular, the oral
health workforce in sub-Saharan Africa is lacking, with an
average ratio of 3.3 dentists per 100,000 people, signiﬁcantly
lower than the global average, aggravated by the ramiﬁca-
tions of the COVID-19 pandemic.16 In response, the World
Health Organization’s (WHO) regional ofﬁce for Africa has pri-
oritized enhancing oral health within the broader NCDs
agenda,17 aligning with the global endeavour for UHC by 2030
to foster political commitments towards oral health.18,19
Aim
The objective of this study is to provide an in-depth examina-
tion of Sudan’s oral health system, expanding the WHO
health systems framework.20-23 This model incorporates the
WHO’s building blocks alongside epidemiological data tai-
lored to the nation, structured into eight dimensions: Health-
care
System
Framework,
Financing,
Service
Delivery,
Epidemiology, Prevention, Personnel, Dental Education and
Training System, and Health Beneﬁt Package.
Methodology
For each dimension, insights and recommendations were
gathered from eminent national experts and key stakehold-
ers in the national oral health sector. From June to December
2021, in collaboration with the Italian Ministry of Foreign
Affairs Agency for International Cooperation—AICS (Agenzia
Italiana per la Cooperazione allo Sviluppo), qualitative unstruc-
tured interviews were conducted with key entities, including
the Curative Medicine Department of the Federal Ministry of
Health, the Oral Health Directorate of Khartoum and Red Sea
state, the National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF), and Khar-
toum University. The interview format included a series of
pre-planned questions. The list of guiding topics was supple-
mented by follow-up and in-depth questions that depended
on the interviewee’s response. These interviews provided
critical information on oral health governance, policies, den-
tal service delivery, staff distribution, health information sys-
tems, and dental education.
Results
Healthcare system framework
The Sudanese healthcare system, as outlined in the 2006 Con-
stitution, the Local Governance Act of 2003, and the Public
Health Law of 2008, places signiﬁcant emphasis on decentral-
ization of services.24 Similarly to neighbouring countries,25,26
decentralization from federal state to the districts endeav-
ours to grant authority to local entities over ﬁnance, human
resources, organization of services, access to care, and gover-
nance. Since the 1990s, the Sudanese health system has
shifted from a Beveridge model to an insurance based Bis-
marckian system.27 The 1994 Health Insurance Law intro-
duced the NHIF to allow access to basic health services
through a national network of facilities and pharmacies. By
2021, about 81.7% of the population was covered.28 The insur-
ance system operates on a contributory basis. Individual sub-
scriptions
are
determined
by
monthly
income
levels.
Employees along with their families are entitled to essential
healthcare services irrespective of size or existing service
costs. The employee contributes 4% of the basic monthly sal-
ary, as opposed to the 6% covered by the employer (Supple-
mentary eTable1). The state bears all treatment costs for
employees and 75% of prescribed medication expenses, as
well as expenses for major and minor operations.29 Social
insurance coverage has progressively expanded to include
voluntary and involuntary members, with compulsory enrol-
ment for the population. Approximately 71% of subscribers
represent impoverished and vulnerable groups, typically
encompassing entire households comprising family heads,
non-working parents, and children (spouses, unmarried
daughters, and male offspring up to 18 years old). Students
are covered up to the age of 25.
As delineated by Dr. Wael Ahmed Fakihammed, Director
of the General Directorate of Health Services at NHIF, policies
and plans are devised at three administrative levels: federal,
state, and district (also referred to as locality). The overall
framework operates under the Federal Ministry of Health and
18 state Ministries of Health. The federal level is responsible
for national health policies, plans, strategies, monitoring and
evaluation, coordination, training, and external relations.
State-level
responsibilities involve formulating
strategies
based on federal guidelines and funding.30,31 Districts focus
primarily on implementation and service delivery. Primary
Health Care (PHC) is the cornerstone of the system, adminis-
tered by the Ministry of Health (MoH), with limited exceptions
for international cooperation and private sector involvement
at federal and state levels. Although over 70% of healthcare
expenditure being allocated to hospitals, PHC receives less
than 6%. Of the hospital funding, 37% is allocated to salaries
and 28% to medications. Despite variations in service levels,

extends to 93% of the population, albeit with signiﬁcant dis-
parities between states and between urban and rural areas.
Urban regions exhibit 25% more outpatient services com-
pared to rural areas. Healthcare utilization among the insured
population is 1.5 times higher than among the uninsured.29,30
At the end of 2016, only 60% of PHC facilities provided the
minimum PHC package, and only one-third were fully opera-
tional. Despite investments in training and education, the
staff turnover rate remains high.
Financing
In 2018, Current Health Expenditure (CHE) exceeded 2.4 bil-
lion US dollars, equating to 4.8% of GDP or 58.84 US dollars per
capita. General Government Health Expenditure relies on fed-
eral and state government allocations, which contribute 6.6%
and 7.8% of CHE, respectively. Private health expenditure
constitutes 69.3% of CHE, with nearly 69.2% being Out-Of-
Pocket (OOP), or 40.7 US dollars per capita. Public sector funds
are 24.1% of total healthcare revenues, while the private sec-
tor accounts for 69.3%. International assistance contributes
6.6% to healthcare ﬁnancing. The NHIF contributes 28%. Hos-
pitals and ambulatory care providers absorb most of the
funds (89%), with about 46% and 43%, respectively. Health
system administration and ﬁnancing, which include govern-
ment administration and social health insurance, consume
around 2%, whereas preventive care providers utilize 6%.
Bilateral organizations and international NGOs spend 2% of
funds on direct services.30,31 The 88.8% of CHE is allocated to
curative services, covering consultation fees, laboratory and
imaging investigations, pharmaceuticals, and other medical
consumables. Preventive and public health programs receive
approximately 5.9% of expenditure, while healthcare gover-
nance and ﬁnancing administration account for 1.9%. Over
36% of OOP is expended at primary health care centres, pri-
marily for user fees and medications, with 40.8% at general
hospitals. Physician’s private clinics and specialized hospitals
receive 16% and 0.8% of OOP expenditure, respectively.
Expenditure on dental care comprises just over 1% (see
Table 1). Households allocate 99.5% of health expenses to
curative care, with preventive care receiving less than 0.5%.
Outpatient curative care services account for nearly 92% of
total OOP spending, while inpatient curative care consumes
5.4%.30,31
Service delivery
Since 2016, there has been a consistent increase in both the
number of MoH facilities accredited with the NHIF and the
overall number of attendees. Dr. Ashwag Abdulrahim, Head
of
the
International
Cooperation
Directorate
at
NHIF’s
Department of Project Development, reported a rise in
accredited facilities from 2,083 to 3,578, along with an
increase in annual attendees from 14,967,113 to 22,455,772.
Notably, the number of beneﬁts provided in the ﬁrst quarter
of 2021 equalled the total provided in the entirety of 2020.28
Khartoum state hosts over 45% of the total MoH facilities.28
NHIF reimbursements to MoH facilities are structured on a
monthly instalment basis, with funds allocated based on
claims amounts. At the facility level, reimbursements are
divided according to predeﬁned percentages: 40% for health
professionals, 40% for equipment and utilities, and 20% to the
state.28
Epidemiology
Systematic surveillance of dental health status in Sudan,
encompassing both paediatric and adult populations, is deﬁ-
cient, and a
comprehensive
nationwide
epidemiological
investigation into oral health has yet to be conducted. Most
available data concerning the prevalence of dental caries in
Sudan is derived from Khartoum state. One out of every two
12-year-old schoolchildren in Sudan reports experiencing an
impact on their daily activities due to caries.32,33 Early child-
hood caries is prevalent among preschool-aged children aged
3 to 5, with approximately a caries prevalence of 52.4% and a
mean decayed, missing, and ﬁlled teeth (dmft) index of 2.3.34
Prevalence of periodontal disease, as bleeding on probing and
a pocket depth of at least 4 mm and clinical attachment loss
of ≥6 mm, was observed to be 24%, particularly among spe-
ciﬁc population sub-groups.35 In 2017, the Sudan National
Cancer Registry documented 920 cases of oral cancer, consti-
tuting 9% of the annual cancer incidence rate.36 From 1970 to
1985, 12.6% of the 14,922 cancer cases registered at the Sudan
Cancer Registry were attributed to oral cavity cancers.37 In
Khartoum state, oral cancer ranked as the second most com-
mon cancer in both genders, following breast and prostate
cancers, comprising 9.4% of all cancers and associated with
low survival rates.38,39 According to the World Health Organi-
zation (WHO), among 27,382 cancers recorded in 2020, 564
were linked to the lip and oral cavity.40 In HIV-infected
patients the prevalence of oral manifestations of HIV and AIDS
is estimated to be between 50% and 60%. A survey conducted
in Omdurman indicated that approximately 76.7% of HIV
patients exhibited oral lesions.41 Noma (cancrum oris) is recog-
nized as a neglected disease of poverty and remains a notable
public health concern in certain impoverished African nations,
although its occurrence is considered infrequent in Sudan.
Prevention
In Sudan, the utilization of the Salvadora persica plant, com-
monly referred to as the toothbrush tree, is widespread. Salva-
dora persica has been documented to exhibit antibacterial,
antifungal,
anticariogenic,
and
antiplaque
properties.42

Traditional oral hygiene practices, including the use of chew-
ing sticks (known as miswak or siwak), crafted from the twigs,
stems, or roots of various plant species, persistently advocated
for their accessibility, affordability, and simplicity.43,44 Despite
the enduring popularity of traditional miswak use, the adop-
tion of toothbrushes and toothpaste is also prevalent.
Personnel
According to data from the WHO Global Health Observatory,
the density of dentistry personnel in Sudan exhibited an
improvement from 0.24 per 10,000 population in 2004 to 2.1 in
2015, a notable increase albeit still lower compared to the
approximate ratio of 1:2,000 observed in most Western coun-
tries.45 Dr. Saafran Mohamed Ahmed Alzaki, Director General
of the MoH in the Red Sea state, reported that as of 2019,
8,964, is the total number of registered dentists, 519 being
specialists. Out of said category, 532 were employed within
the MoH, resulting in a density of 0.12 dentists per 10,000 pop-
ulation. Personnel engaged in private practice is not formally
registered. The distribution of dentistry personnel appears to
be disorganized and concentrated in Khartoum (Supplemen-
tary eTable2). Dental laboratory technicians and dental assis-
tants are scarce. The recording system for allied health
professionals is deﬁcient. Oral hygienists and dental assis-
tants are legally authorised to practice under the current leg-
islation.
Sudan
has
experienced
a
brain
drain,
with
approximately 60% of health professionals leaving the coun-
try since the early 2000s.46,47
Dental education and training system
Sudan boasts a rich history of medical education spanning
over a century, with institutions such as Gezira University,
Khartoum University, and the Sudan Medical Specialization
Board.48 As for data provided by Dr. Shaza K. Abass, Dean of
the Faculty of Dentistry, University of Khartoum, Universities
are predominantly concentrated in Khartoum (see Figure 1).
Training and the production of healthcare professionals have
seen consistent growth, with both public (55%) and private
(45%) universities (Supplementary eTable3) experiencing an
upsurge.49,50 Gender distribution is largely equal, with a
demographic skewed towards young professionals.
The Ministry of Education (MoE) oversees pre-service
training and production of health workers across public uni-
versities with medical and health science facilities. The Medi-
cal Council is responsible for the registration and licensing of
doctors, pharmacists, and dentists. Civil service under the
Federal Ministry of Health is the primary employer, along
with other sectors such as the military, police, universities,
and the Health Insurance Fund. Universities offering dental
programs in Sudan are situated in major cities, with 33 uni-
versities offering such programs, nine of which were under
approval in 2021. Upon graduation, dental university students
are required to undergo a probationary period in an MoH hos-
pital, with temporary registration provided by the Medical
Council. Permanent registration is granted upon completion
of the internship. While a system of continuous medical edu-
cation through seminars and workshops has been estab-
lished, it lacks formalization, and there is currently no
monitoring system in place. Postgraduate programs are
offered by both the MoE and the MoH through the Sudan
Medical Specialization Board (SMSB). The SMSB offers Medi-
cal Doctorate programs, while the MoE offers postgraduate
programs, with both institutions also providing opportunities
for PhD programs.
Health beneﬁt package
The general health beneﬁt package includes an extensive
group of service: (1) medical consultations; (2) laboratory
investigations (routine, chemical, serology, haematology,
etc); (3) diagnostic investigations like radiology and imaging
diagnostic services (X- rays, U/S, MRI, CT, etc.); (4) surgical
operations such general surgery, ENT, GIT, orthopaedics, oph-
thalmology, urology, obstetric and gynaecological, cardiovas-
cular,
dermatology,
etc.);
other
services
such
as
physiotherapy, dental services, and respiratory tract, hearing,
cardiovascular, nephrology, psychiatric, and eye care. The
dental health beneﬁt package is described in Table 2.

challenges continue to impact the stability of national serv-
ices, including healthcare. Aligning with the current state of
the aforementioned system, shifting focus towards UHC rep-
resents a progressive step and a potential remedy to address
supply deﬁciencies and healthcare demands. The outlined
objectives for oral health within the context of UHC include
integrating essential oral health services into the basic health
beneﬁt package, aligning the oral health workforce with pop-
ulation health needs and social determinants of health, and
ensuring ﬁnancial protection and inclusion of dental care
coverage in health insurance packages, alongside expanding
ﬁscal resources for oral healthcare.51
Although the relatively low burden of NCDs in Sudan
compared to high-income countries, global and oral health
needs are escalating. The increasing demand reveal limita-
tions in healthcare services and highlights accessibility
issues, particularly for individuals in the lowest income
quartiles, whose access to care is often determined by
ﬁnancial means. The development of preventive measures
and supporting community-based programs constitute a
viable approach to partially alleviate pressing require-
ments within the healthcare system. Particularly when
customized to target speciﬁc demographic cohorts such as
children and implemented through school-based initia-
tives.
Such
strategies
yield
compounding
advantages
throughout an individual’s lifespan.52-54
The predominant focus of care under NHIF revolves
around curative therapies (see Table 2), reﬂecting a thera-
peutic-cantered model akin to "westernized dentistry."55
However, the density of dentists per population is low,
scatter, and predominantly concentrated in urban areas.
Despite an overall increase in the number of oral health
professionals, there is a shortage of cost-effective pro-
viders.56 The WHO Oral Health Strategy 2023-2030 suggests
innovative approaches to oral healthcare workforce plan-
ning.57 As a low-income country, Sudan can beneﬁt from a
team-approach focused on mid-level providers (e.g., dental
therapists, hygienists, dental nurses, schoolteachers, and
social workers).58 Costs for dentist training are often pro-
hibitively high and advanced education should reﬂect local
demand to enhance competencies in public health, health
promotion, and disease prevention. Allied oral health pro-
fessionals are equipped with clinical and public health
competencies aimed to prevent and treat prevalent oral
diseases through essential oral healthcare and rehabilita-
tion interventions within a primary care framework. This
approach prioritizes comprehensive care over reliance on
advanced technologies and excessive specialization, which
are often dominant practices in such ﬁeld. Also, the phe-
nomenon of medical brain drain exacerbates the shortage
of healthcare professionals, with desirable working condi-
tions, improved education access, political stability, higher
salaries, and training opportunities serving as major driv-
ers for migration.59,60 To bridge the gap between acute
workforce shortages and access to care, further commu-
nity-oriented training for oral health professionals is nec-
essary,
emphasizing
prevention
and
health
promotion
within integrated public health services.61-64
The establishment of the NHIF in 2005 aimed to include
vulnerable population groups historically reliant on out-
of-pocket payments into essential oral health services.
However, barriers to enrolment persist due to geographical
and organizational constraints. Individual assistance strat-
egies and community outreach initiatives can facilitate
enrolment by disseminating information about the NHIF
and providing resources to the public.65 Additionally, long-
term insurance plan subsidies and free preventive care
treatments for vulnerable groups, such as children, can
alleviate ﬁnancial burdens.66-68
This study was conducted during and after one of the
waves of the COVID-19 pandemic, at which stage there may
have been changes in the health system as lessons are learnt.
To conclude, coordinated interventions can drive oral
health policies and planning away from the traditional model
of restorative dentistry towards primary prevention and oral
health promotion integrated across all levels of the health-
care system, ultimately advancing towards UHC. Improving
access entails addressing health inequalities, expanding the
role of oral health allied professionals, ensuring ﬁnancial sus-
tainability through cost containment measures, and facilitat-
ing patient enrolment in existing health insurance schemes.

Healthcare needs in rural areas differ significantly from those in urban areas. Addressing the healthcare chal­
lenges in rural communities is of paramount importance, as these regions often lack access to adequate 
healthcare facilities. Moreover, technological advancements, particularly in the realm of the Internet of Things 
(IoT), have brought about significant changes in the healthcare industry. IoT involves connecting real-world 
objects to digital devices, opening up various possibilities for improving healthcare delivery. One promising 
application of IoT is its use in monitoring the spread of diseases in remote villages through interconnected 
sensors and devices. Surprisingly, there has been a noticeable absence of comprehensive research on this topic. 
Therefore, the primary objective of this study is to conduct a thorough and systematic review of intelligent IoT- 
based healthcare systems in rural communities and their governance. The analysis covers research papers 
published until December 2022 to provide valuable insights for future researchers. The selected articles have 
been categorized into three main groups: monitoring, intelligent services, and body sensor networks. The find­
ings indicate that IoT research has garnered significant attention within the healthcare community. Furthermore, 
the results illustrate the potential benefits of IoT for governments, especially in rural areas, in improving public 
health and strengthening economic ties. It is worth noting that establishing a robust security infrastructure is 
essential for implementing IoT effectively, given its innovative operational principles. In summary, this review 
enhances scholars’ understanding of the current state of IoT research in rural healthcare settings while high­
lighting areas that warrant further investigation. Additionally, it keeps healthcare professionals informed about 
the latest advancements and applications of IoT in rural healthcare.   
1. Introduction 
Death rates in underdeveloped nations are significantly higher 
compared to other industrialized countries, primarily because timely 
access to medical care cannot always be guaranteed. A substantial 
number of these fatalities could be prevented with access to high-quality 
medical treatment. Access to such healthcare is often limited for rural 
residents [1,2]. This issue is not new; metropolitan areas tend to have 
more healthcare personnel and better-equipped medical facilities. In 
developing nations’ rural communities, people often overlook their 
health concerns due to poverty or a lack of awareness. For instance, a 
majority of cancer-related deaths occur because abnormal cell growth in 
the final stages is detected too late. Many lives could be saved if this 
abnormal cell growth were detected in the early stages of cancer [3]. 
Limited access to nursing and diagnostic services is a common challenge 
for rural residents due to the absence of advanced healthcare technol­
ogy. Rural communities face additional challenges, including inade­
quate telecommunication and power infrastructure, low population 
density, poor road conditions, distance from urban areas, and a shortage 
of locally available trained professionals. These constraints should be

taken into account when developing essential systems like Active 
Assisted Living (AAL). Consequently, rural residents lack access to 
quality healthcare [4]. 
Various applications are linked to the Internet of Things (IoT), 
including manufacturing, retail, logistics, intelligent transportation 
systems, energy and utilities, urban management, parking, environ­
mental monitoring, agriculture, healthcare, disaster management, and 
home automation [5–8]. IoT represents a paradigm shift in sensing, 
networking, and computing technologies [9,10]. It encompasses a wide 
range of sensors and input-output devices, such as cameras, micro­
phones, keyboards, speakers, Near Field Communications (NFC), dis­
plays, accelerometers, and Bluetooth, among others. The central 
component of IoT is the Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) system, 
which can automatically detect moving or stationary objects [11]. IoT 
entails connecting devices with sensors and enabling real-time moni­
toring. It serves as a bridge between the physical and digital realms [12]. 
Devices and sensors with Internet connectivity allow remote manage­
ment and monitoring of diverse systems, as well as interaction over the 
Internet. The primary objective of IoT is to leverage the power of the 
Internet to monitor and control various objects and processes. 
In the healthcare sector, IoT is employed to provide high-quality 
treatment and advanced diagnostics using interconnected medical 
equipment and a suite of health applications [13,14]. This advancement 
has the potential to address healthcare delivery challenges in rural areas. 
IoT in healthcare aims to simplify the lives of both healthcare providers 
and patients [15]. For example, by leveraging digital communication 
tools like e-prescriptions, e-visits, and remote monitoring, IoT offers the 
opportunity to streamline the transition of care from primary clinics to 
patients’ homes [16,17]. However, there are hurdles to adopting IoT in 
underdeveloped regions. Key barriers to using Information and Com­
munications Technology (ICT) in rural communities include language 
barriers, adoption costs, and a lack of telecommunications infrastructure 
[18,19]. Moreover, concerns related to privacy, confidentiality, ethics, 
and the availability of human resources hinder the implementation of 
new technology in remote settings. 
As technology continues to advance, health becomes an increasingly 
prominent concern for individuals. IoT plays a pivotal role in expediting 
and streamlining diagnostic procedures while also reducing healthcare 
expenses [20,21]. The contemporary patient healthcare management 
system is a remarkable IoT tool that connects seamlessly with sensors 
and networks [22,23]. These devices employ interconnected compo­
nents for monitoring health. Subsequently, sensors utilize various pro­
cessing modules, such as the Arduino Uno and Nodemcu, to transmit 
data to smartphones [24]. This method offers a straightforward, scal­
able, time-efficient, cost-effective, interoperable, and uncomplicated 
means of monitoring and enhancing healthcare conditions [25,26]. For 
example, in numerous developing communities, some individuals may 
find smartphones too intricate to use. This challenge becomes particu­
larly pronounced when users’ native languages or scripts are not sup­
ported by their smartphones, when the devices are prohibitively 
expensive, lack network support, or require frequent recharging in areas 
with unreliable power sources [27,28]. The application of IoT technol­
ogy holds promise in alleviating these challenges. In such scenarios, 
opting for affordable devices with extended battery life and user- 
friendly interfaces that mitigate language barriers may represent a 
more practical choice than relying on smartphones. To extend health­
care benefits to rural areas, towns could explore the possibility of 
investing in wireless network base stations with a range of 10–15 km, 
available for approximately £400. Such an investment could enable 
rural communities to access at least some of the healthcare innovations 
implemented in urban areas of Western countries [29]. 
Conversely, technology, including inexpensive computers and 
internet connectivity, is enabling the development of new healthcare 
services that can assist individuals of all ages in mitigating the effects of 
chronic illnesses [30,31]. In specific situations, users may selectively 
share information with individuals who can provide assistance, such as 
family members, or with businesses legally obligated to safeguard users’ 
interests, such as social services. Nevertheless, rural communities in 
developing nations may unintentionally miss out on these trans­
formative benefits due to communication constraints, financial limita­
tions that hinder access to such systems, or the absence of localization 
efforts that would make services more user-friendly in their native lan­
guages. Globally, 3.9 billion individuals lack internet access, with the 
majority residing in rural areas [29].  
• The gap 
Emerging technologies hold the potential to revolutionize various 
medical treatments and enable remote surgery. IoT technologies offer 
significant promise in addressing urgent global health challenges. 
Among the myriad benefits of IoT, telemedicine stands out for its pivotal 
role in delivering emergency healthcare services. The IoT-based smart 
healthcare system represents a paradigm shift in patient care by 
enabling real-time remote monitoring of patients. Concurrently, the 
aging population and the recent surge in chronic diseases have sparked a 
revolution in remote health monitoring in affluent nations. IoT-based 
smart healthcare services designed for rural people leverage smart 
medical devices, mobile phones, mobile and web applications, as well as 
computers. Through these IoT-driven healthcare services, skilled medi­
cal professionals can remotely supervise a patient’s well-being, issue 
prescriptions online, and ensure accessible and timely healthcare solu­
tions for underserved communities. The expansion of health monitoring 
systems has been facilitated by advances in wireless body sensors and 
the growth of cloud computing applications, which provide substantial 
processing and storage capabilities for health data. With advancing 
technology, realizing these goals through the implementation of existing 
concepts and identifying existing gaps is feasible. In light of the above, 
the healthcare sector still faces numerous challenges when introducing 
intelligent IoT-based healthcare systems for rural societies. The primary 
challenges are outlined below:  
• Limitation of technical resources  
• Patients’ acceptance  
• Lack of interest in adopting new technology for people  
• Lack of proper marketing of this system  
• Trust issues of patients  
• Awareness of people, especially of rural people  
• Staff’s motivation for not working in rural areas 
This article introduces a novel approach, the Systematic Literature 
Review (SLR), as its primary methodology within the field under dis­
cussion. The systematic approach holds paramount significance and has 
garnered extensive attention in article reviews, as emphasized in various 
scholarly works, such as [32,33]. Given the growing body of literature 
on IoT and healthcare, coupled with the scarcity of comprehensive, 
systematic analyses on this subject, there is a compelling need to outline 
the current state of existing knowledge. Therefore, this research is 
motivated by the necessity to trace the evolution of this specific field of 
inquiry and shed light on its underlying intellectual landscape. It aims to 
achieve this by methodically mapping and visually presenting the 
breadth and structure of research where IoT intersects with healthcare, 
particularly in rural areas. Considering the absence of a Systematic 
Literature Review in this domain, this article serves as a valuable guide 
for researchers and provides an overview of previous studies. This work 
offers a collection of comprehensive guidelines to clarify the path to­
ward understanding intelligent IoT-based healthcare systems in rural 
societies and governance. Furthermore, applying SLR can help identify 
areas of research deficiency within this domain. The current review will 
greatly assist researchers by outlining existing challenges and pointing 
the way for future research in this field. The study’s questions and ob­
jectives will be examined in the following section.

2. Motivation and study’s aim 
Numerous scholars have addressed various issues related to chronic 
illnesses, healthcare Artificial Intelligence (AI), and healthcare IoT in 
rural societies and governance, contributing to research in these areas. 
This section focuses on reviewing the literature in these fields. Several 
review articles are discussed below to highlight the shortcomings of 
previous research and clarify the motivation and objectives of this study. 
Yuehong, Zeng [34] established a framework for this field and out­
lined potential research directions. Through an extensive literature re­
view, the growth of IoT in healthcare systems was examined from the 
perspectives of supporting technology and methodology, IoT-enabled 
smart devices and systems, and multiple IoT deployments in the 
healthcare sector. The article also extensively discussed the challenges 
and prospects of implementing IoT-based healthcare systems. Qi, Yang 
[35] conducted a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) on advanced IoT- 
enabled personalized healthcare systems to understand the progress of 
IoT technology in personalized healthcare. Their analysis covered key 
supporting technologies, major IoT-enabled implementations, and 
active healthcare case studies. The article highlighted potential research 
developments and challenges. 
Gandhi and Ghosal [36] systematically examined intelligent 
healthcare systems employing IoT. They explored various emerging 
technologies and their practical applications, explaining intelligent 
healthcare networks’ fundamental architecture, platform, and topology. 
The article emphasized the crucial role of IoT in healthcare imple­
mentation, including its diverse applications. Marques, Pitarma [37] 
delved into cutting-edge IoT architectures designed to enhance living 
environments (ELEs) and healthcare systems. Their focus encompassed 
technology, implementation methodologies, potential threats, pros­
pects, open-source networks, and operating systems. This report syn­
thesized existing knowledge and identified important connections and 
gaps within the field, paving the way for innovative and relevant ave­
nues for future research. Poyner and Sherratt [29] proposed solutions to 
simplify access to healthcare for rural residents while ensuring the 
protection of private health data and the delivery of adequate services, 
even with limited user equipment and connections. They found that a 
community-based healthcare monitoring service could be suitable for 
technologies like LoRa, Weightless-P, and RPMA (Random Phase Mul­
tiple Access). Further research is needed to evaluate factors like pricing, 
battery life, complexity, and security. Additionally, commercial con­
straints, such as the requirement to purchase services from a national 
provider, should be considered in underserved communities. Finally, 
Darwish, Hassanien [38] reviewed the latest literature regarding the 
convergence of cloud computing and IoT, specifically addressing 
healthcare application challenges such as patient management, smart 
hospitals, and remote medical services. The article offers a contempo­
rary perspective, identifies gaps in the integration of multiple aspects, 
and discusses various proposals for cloud/IoT health systems. It delves 
into the challenges that need to be addressed, suggests potential avenues 
for further research, and provides an extensive bibliography. The key 
factors discussed in the relevant literature are summarized in Table 1, 
where a “+” indicates their presence and a “−” signifies their absence. 
IoT technology and healthcare systems have undergone extensive 
study, which is well-documented in literature surveys, as indicated in 
Table 1. Two pivotal dimensions of ongoing research have garnered 
particular attention. However, there is a conspicuous absence of publicly 
available surveys examining the impact of intelligent IoT-based 
healthcare systems on rural communities and governance. The pri­
mary objective of this paper is to conduct a comprehensive review of 
intelligent IoT-based healthcare systems within rural societies and their 
implications for governance. A thorough comprehension of IoT within 
the context of healthcare systems is crucial at this point to pave the way 
for future research. This report aims to provide an effective overview of 
the core supporting architectures, primary applications, barriers, and 
prospects of healthcare systems. While numerous research articles on 
IoT for the healthcare sector have been published in the literature, the 
recent proliferation of IoT platforms is evident. However, these assess­
ments do not focus on the analysis of healthcare processes within the 
realm of intelligent IoT. Therefore, the primary innovation of this report 
lies in its systematic and comparative analysis of healthcare systems in 
rural societies and governance, specifically within the framework of 
intelligent IoT. The report also proposes solutions to healthcare chal­
lenges and highlights the issues facing today’s healthcare services while 
analyzing how IoT can assist in resolving them. The discourse on several 
primary future research issues is expected to provide a significant 
context for future research projects, promoting the development and 
application of IoT in healthcare. Ultimately, this analysis article aims to 
be beneficial by drawing the attention of scholars, engineers, and 
healthcare practitioners to a subject that is crucial for advancing future 
healthcare systems. 
3. Methodology 
The selection of primary works for review aims to provide a clear 
picture of intelligent IoT-based healthcare systems in rural governance.  
• Research Methodology 
Systematic Literature Review (SLR) methodology, derived from the 
field of medicine, offers a repeatable research approach [39]. SLR should 
encompass the essential information that other researchers need to 
consider [40,41]. The purpose of an SLR is to provide an accurate 
assessment of a research topic by employing a comprehensive, reliable, 
Y. Ge et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
Artificial Intelligence In Medicine 146 (2023) 102702
4
and auditable process, as demonstrated by [42,43]. 
This section adheres to the SLR criteria with a precise focus on 
research related to intelligent IoT-based healthcare systems to enhance 
the potential of healthcare system strategies. In SLR, the initial step 
involves developing a protocol that reinforces the study’s approach, 
including survey questions and methods employed throughout the re­
view process. The following part outlines three defined research topics 
that address the main issues in healthcare systems. Such a process, 
within the parameters of this study, aims to yield comprehensive re­
sponses. After recognizing the need for the investigation, the survey 
methodology was established for the study using research questions. The 
stages of its development are distinctive and include criteria and source 
selection, quality evaluation standards, the search query, the data 
extraction process, and the data synthesis technique.  
• Search Query 
Important and relevant phrases are outlined to expand search terms 
for scholarly databases. The utilization of search strings and Boolean 
operators (AND, OR) is clarified by including synonyms for each query 
element as well as alternate spellings. Carefully selected terms that best 
describe the search query and encompass the desired topic are used. 
Hence, keywords such as “intelligent IoT,” “healthcare systems,” and 
“rural governance” have been employed. The question is explained 
following several phases and a preliminary analysis of the outcome 
coverage. To enhance the query string, keywords like “intelligent IoT” or 
“smart IoT” or “Internet of Things” AND “healthcare systems” AND 
“rural governance” AND “rural societies” are used in cases where the 
initial query did not yield comprehensive results. The search terms 
encompass the scope of the study, including body, titles, and abstracts. 
The research is conducted up to December 2022.  
• Sources Selection 
The ability to refine the search by abstract and title is a requirement 
for search techniques. Therefore, the study selection process is divided 
into two primary stages: In the initial phase, only Google Scholar1 and 
Scopus2 are employed to discover relevant papers because they cover 
other search engine results for a variety of terms. In the second stage, 
publications are chosen using search criteria from publishers including 
Elsevier,3 Springer,4 Emerald,5 IEEE,6 ACM,7 Taylor,8 and Wiley.9  
• Selection Criteria 
In this survey, the assessment of peer-reviewed journals for eligible 
articles published until December 2022 involves the establishment of 
inclusion criteria based on a quality evaluation checklist [44]. The 
checklist includes the following questions: (a) Does the research report 
provide a clear description of the research methodology? (b) Is the 
selected methodology suitable for the subject matter under investiga­
tion? (c) Has the study been properly executed and reviewed? If the 
survey meets the assessment criteria, ‘yes’ is marked accordingly. In our 
survey protocol, Table 2 outlines the exclusion and inclusion criteria.  
• Data Extraction and Quality Assessment 
The data from the case investigations are summarized at the data 
extraction step for further analysis. 590 items were identified in the 
early phase. Fig. 1 shows all published articles by year. As evident from 
the figure, there has been a noticeable upward trend in the number of 
published articles in recent years. This trend underscores the growing 
interest and research efforts among scholars in the realm of IoT-based 
healthcare systems. 
The investigations found that 386 articles have been published in 
famous journals such as Elsevier, Springer, IEEE, etc. Fig. 2 shows 
relevant articles in different journals. As Fig. 2 shows, IEEE and Springer 
have the most published articles. 
Subsequently, inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied to filter 
the articles. Afterward, abstracts, search terms, and the article sum­
maries that best represented their contributions were reviewed. Inef­
fective papers were subsequently discarded, leaving 41 items at this

stage. Following a thorough examination of articles, irrelevant ones 
were further eliminated. The utilization of inclusion and exclusion 
criteria, along with a quality evaluation checklist, played a crucial role 
in filtering these articles. Ultimately, 17 papers were identified as the 
primary research that required review. The approach used to identify 
the works in this study is illustrated in Fig. 3. 
4. Literature survey 
The demand for affordable healthcare services is steadily rising 
among people of all ages [45]. New advancements in information and 
communication technologies, such as IoT and cyber-physical networks, 
enable us to enhance healthcare applications for everyday life (at home 
or in the office) and hospitals, providing more intelligent and predictive 
capabilities [46]. As a result, researchers worldwide have undertaken 
various technical initiatives aimed at reshaping healthcare delivery by 
harnessing the potential of IoT, aligning it with existing programs. IoT 
represents an ecosystem of interconnected devices, built on sensing 
technologies and advanced computing systems, poised to revolutionize 
global computing and data mining [47]. The convergence of technology 
and healthcare has undergone a profound transformation in recent 
times, driven by the rise of intelligent IoT, Artificial Intelligence (AI), 
and consumers’ widespread adoption of medical-grade wearables. 
Through customized resources, targeted content, increased availability 
and connectivity, and cost-effective distribution, AI-powered IoT has 
enabled revolutionary improvements and unique opportunities in the 
healthcare industry [48]. Therefore, with promising technical, financial, 
and social prospects, the IoT movement is reshaping contemporary 
healthcare. In this section, the selected articles from the previous section 
will be analyzed. These chosen articles are categorized into three sec­
tions based on their objectives (see Fig. 4). 
4.1. Monitoring 
Personalized healthcare monitoring has become an increasingly 
prominent focus area due to the ongoing development of computing and 
networking technology. With new attributes and capabilities expected, 
consumer demand for healthcare services continues to rise. The advent 
of IoT brings individuals closer to connecting the physical world to the 
Internet [49]. In the realm of monitoring, researchers and healthcare 
professionals have incorporated environmental sensors into remote 
monitoring systems, enabling remote monitoring of patients’ well-being

and health in both home and critical care settings [50]. This section 
analyzes articles related to monitoring, with key findings summarized in 
Table 3. 
Rohokale, Prasad [51] proposed an innovative cooperative IoT 
approach for applications such as the safe motherhood program and 
rural healthcare. Their approach stands out for its distinctive feature, 
operating without the need for node location information or trans­
mitting vital data source power. This methodology has the potential for 
critical healthcare applications, including continuous monitoring and 
control of essential human health metrics such as hemoglobin levels, 
blood pressure, blood sugar, and more. This approach represents a sig­
nificant step toward achieving a sustainable IoT, with a notable energy 
savings of 57 %. The energy savings realized at low threshold levels are 
an additional benefit, with outage behavior nearly identical to that of 
the amplify and forward approach. The NS-2 testing revealed a signifi­
cant improvement in system throughput, highlighting the tradeoff be­
tween energy consumption, latency, and throughput in S-MAC 
operation. 
Rasid, Musa [49] explored gateway services catering to IoT appli­
cations within the ubiquitous healthcare system, facilitating intelligent 
and automated monitoring. Their device relied on Position (IP) con­
nectivity and the Internet, enabling seamless end-to-end communication 
from each 6LoWPAN (IPv6 over low-power wireless area networks) 
sensor node to the Internet’s web user interface. The proposed gateway 
algorithm orchestrated a multi-threaded process involving converting 
collected medical signals into tangible data, attribute extraction, and 
wireless visualization. The results demonstrated users’ seamless access 
to medical data via smartphones and handheld devices through the 
server’s user interface. This approach embodies the concept of ubiquity, 
envisioning the fusion of the Internet with objects and healthcare for the 
benefit of individuals. 
To showcase the extensive range of healthcare and daily life domains 
where IoT can be implemented, Srinivasa, Sowmya [45] presented three 
schemes. The first scheme monitors babies to track their cries while 
sleeping and alerts parents when it detects crib swinging. The second 
scheme aims to expedite the recovery of patients undergoing knee sur­
gery or knee-related surgeries by monitoring knee motions using ac­
celerometers attached to the joint. The third system encourages the 
blind to choose the correct fabric combination using picture and pattern 
recognition. These three proposed schemes cater to individuals of all 
ages, offering practical solutions to numerous healthcare and daily life 
challenges. 
Boakye and Babatunde Olumide [52] investigated the potential 
benefits of IoT technology for enhancing health in low-resource envi­
ronments, focusing on modernizing patient care and improving effec­
tiveness in rural Ghana and Sierra Leone. Their research identified and 
optimized strategies for harnessing IoT technology to alleviate health­
care challenges faced by underserved communities. This included efforts 
to enhance remote patient monitoring, expand access to health-related 
information, educate healthcare personnel, and reduce the financial 
burden of out-of-pocket medical expenses. Their findings unequivocally 
emphasized that IoT technologies have the potential to significantly 
improve healthcare outcomes among individuals residing in remote and 
underserved regions, particularly those with mobility constraints or 
difficulties accessing healthcare facilities. 
Bhuiyan, Billah [53] demonstrated a real-time, IoT-based health 
monitoring system capable of assessing, tracking, and reporting people’s 
health conditions both online and offline from any location. Their IoT- 
based system enables the instant transfer of private medical data to 
hospitals and caregivers. The proposed system measures pulse rate, body

temperature, room temperature, oxygen saturation, and air quality in a 
smart home environment, utilizing Arduino UNO, Nodemcu, and a 
global system for mobile communication modules. The device can also 
provide the patient’s previous medical information. Evaluation through 
test scenarios showed excellent performance and accuracy. This 
approach holds significant promise for both urban and rural commu­
nities in developing nations. 
The articles within the monitoring category underwent meticulous 
scrutiny, aligning with the criteria elucidated in Table 3. The key at­
tributes distilled from these papers are concisely summarized in Table 3. 
The analyzed mechanisms within this category offer notable advantages, 
including energy efficiency, enhanced performance, seamless interop­
erability, heightened security, unwavering reliability, and minimized 
deviations from expected outcomes. Conversely, notable drawbacks 
include diminished interoperability and limited scalability. 
4.2. Body sensor networks 
Medical assistance systems and sensor-based IoT applications offer a 
unique capability for remote patient monitoring. Leveraging IoT- 
powered medical resources and assistance enables physicians to seam­
lessly access patient records, whether patients are at home, in the hos­
pital, or elsewhere. The development of portable technologies and 
wearable body sensors is on the rise for monitoring individual health 
and safety [54]. A significant advancement in IoT enhancements for 
healthcare tracking systems lies in developing wearable sensor pro­
cessing [55]. A body sensor network connects various medical sensors 
and implants placed inside and/or outside the human body, offering 
flexible solutions for healthcare practitioners and cost savings [56]. 
These sensors can monitor vital statistics such as chemical imbalances in 
glucose levels, bloodstream, blood pressure, nerve and brain activity, 
heart status, and various behavioral and psychological symptoms 
through separate electronic sensors connected to patients and wirelessly 
linked to IoT systems. Utilizing data analysis on the collected data en­
ables doctors to make remote recommendations [57]. Furthermore, the 
integration of healthcare IoT has led to the emergence of intelligent 
applications such as mobile healthcare and smart healthcare manage­
ment systems [54]. This section examines articles related to body sensor 
networks, with key findings summarized in Table 4. 
SJ and Sekar [58] introduced an IoT-based intelligent home-centric 
healthcare system, connecting smart physiological tracking sensors 
attached to the human body with intelligent prescription packaging for 
daily medication management. Their system offers remote prescription 
and medication non-compliance services. When medication runs low, 
the deficiency data is instantly sent to the doctor’s smartphone via the 
app. Hospital staff can refill the medication box accordingly. This pro­
posed home-centric healthcare system promotes ubiquitous and

personalized treatment. 
For IoT-oriented body sensor network infrastructures, Yeh [59] 
presented a robust healthcare system with two authentication proced­
ures to meet essential security requirements. They conducted a thorough 
formal analysis to evaluate the security of the proposed authentication 
methods. The resilience of both systems was confirmed. In summary, 
they demonstrated that the proposed IoT-based healthcare system is 
suitable for deployment on typical intelligent mobile devices with robust 
security measures, ensuring its practicality. 
Rathore, Ahmad [60] unveiled an IoT-based real-time medical 
emergency response system employing human body-mounted medical 
sensors. The recommended architecture includes data collection, anal­
ysis, and decision-making components, forming an “intelligent building” 
with a layered design and implementation concept. The system’s 
effectiveness was assessed using various medical sensor datasets and 
real-time network traffic. The results indicated that the recommended 
system could effectively handle sensory input from users worldwide 
through body area networks, enabling real-time responses in 
emergencies. 
By distributing intelligence across sensors, edge/fog nodes, and 
cloud layers, Farahani, Barzegari [48] proposed a comprehensive, 
collaborative IoT e-health architecture powered by AI. As a case study, 
they explored how to map online ECG (Electrocardiogram)-based 
arrhythmia detection to the infrastructure to justify the suggested multi- 
architecture. Their approach distributes intelligence across various IoT 
layers, allowing for trade-offs between accuracy, contact latency, pro­
cessing time, and power consumption. 
Rahman, Kashem [61] introduced a novel IoT-based technique for 
ECG monitoring systems for cardiovascular patients. The system 
collected and analyzed P, Q, R, S, and T ECG signal characteristics to 
track cardiovascular conditions for improved health management. Ma­
chine learning (ML) was used to assess the error rate and the importance 
of ECG signal characteristics. The logistic regression model achieved the 
best agreement between training and test data. The IoT-based ECG 
system reduced the complexity and cost of treating cardiovascular 
disorders. 
A total of five papers were reviewed in the body sensor networks 
category. These studies were evaluated based on the criteria outlined in 
Table 4, and the key aspects of each article, including their strengths and 
weaknesses, have been summarized in Table 4. The primary advantages 
observed in this category include enhanced security, accuracy, effi­
ciency, feasibility, cost-effectiveness, reduced processing times, and 
energy efficiency. Conversely, the main drawbacks in this category 
relate to limited electrical reliability and communication latency. 
4.3. Intelligent service 
In particular, the IoT has been commonly used to link available 
medical services to supply elderly and critically ill patients with a 
secure, affordable, and smart healthcare service [62]. Everything can be 
a part of it in IoT if it is an unintelligent artifact or sensor node; there­
fore, it is possible to create incredibly various kinds of services. 
Accordingly, data collection, control of resources, development and 
exploration of facilities, and management of resources and power will 
promote sophisticated processes and much-improved infrastructure 
[63]. Nevertheless, enhanced life expectancy is the most desired 
advantage and welcoming improvement for healthcare providers and 
individuals. The cost associated with healthcare facilities tends to 
escalate because of the rising expense of prescription medications, 
medical supplies, and hospital treatment. Therefore, developing and 
introducing technology-based strategies to deliver better patient care at 
a reasonable price is an absolute requirement [50]. Smart e-health 
gateways can be effectively deployed to allow the massive execution of 
pervasive health monitoring systems, particularly in clinical environ­
ments [46]. The articles related to intelligent service are analyzed in this 
section, and the key factors are summarized in Table 5. 
Bhatia and Sood [64] presented an IoT-based intelligent healthcare 
framework to supply ubiquitous healthcare to individuals within their 
workout sessions. The proposed framework’s intelligence stems from its 
ability to evaluate real-time health problems throughout workouts and 
forecast the probabilistic health situation’s vulnerability. Compared to 
different modern methods, the findings showed that the suggested 
method was inferior in efficiency and extremely successful in providing 
health care throughout workouts. 
Ahmed [65] introduced a case study on a health IoT system that 
creates an intelligent healthcare service to track vital signs in everyday 
life. The generic architectures’ key objective was to support sensors, safe 
and secure data communication, communication media, remote data 
access, and cloud-based storage. The initial user assessment outcome 
showed the deployed scheme’s effectiveness and efficiency via the 
suggested structure. The machine then provides feedback, advice, and 
warnings in a customized way, based on the medical info and health 
criteria of the elderly. 
In order to include preventive and intelligent healthcare, Chatterjee, 
Cymberknop [66] worked on facets of IoT and decision support systems. 
This research’s goal was two-fold to develop the elements of an IoT- 
healthcare network and decision support framework, fulfilling the

aims of an integrated healthcare system powered by technology. It was 
also meant to demonstrate the same by referring to cardiovascular dis­
orders and defining risk groups from a representative group of in­
dividuals. Specifically, this system has been utilized to assess risk 
categories from a representative collection of individuals regarding 
cardiovascular disease. The risk categories were established based on 
their probability of developing a cardiovascular disorder. Such a 
framework provides a shared forum for all healthcare stakeholders. It 
can also be expanded in other areas since using the decision support 
system operates well in disease prediction. 
In order to provide widespread human activity identification utiliz­
ing data processing methods, Subasi, Radhwan [54] introduced an IoT- 
based intelligent mobile healthcare infrastructure. They proposed a 
user-dependent data mining technique to classify offline human activity 
and established a robust and accurate model to identify IoT-based 
human activity. Findings indicate that, with 99.89 % accuracy, the 
suggested method is superior in performance and is highly robust, effi­
cient, and reliable in providing m-healthcare services throughout 
various activities. 
Lu, Wang [67] introduced a smart medical service system design 
aimed at optimizing the utilization of medical services and enhancing 
the effectiveness of medical diagnostic methods, particularly within 
complex business scenarios in the medical IoT environment. The study 
delved into the functioning of the resource representation model, the 
resource discovery method based on latent factor modeling, and the 
multi-terminal aggregation technique. Subsequently, they devised a 
smart medical service architecture within the IoT ecosystem, drawing 
from open-source projects. Empirical investigations conducted using 
real-world datasets underscored that the proposed design for the smart 
medical service system could, to a certain extent, facilitate the efficient 
management of medical services. Furthermore, it held the potential to 
enhance digitization, precision, and intelligence within the medical 
sector. 
Nautiyal and Devi [68] demonstrated a portable healthcare gadget 
IoT-enabled prototype. This tool was created for healthcare pro­
fessionals to help them solve the issue of preserving patient medical 
records in remote locations and collecting medical data. They interfaced 
medical sensors such as pulse oximetry, blood pressure, and body tem­
perature sensors to assess the fundamental physiological indicators with 
a single microprocessor. They designed a particular key-based entry 
system composed of a keypad to input individuals allocated unique 
Application Programming Interface (API) key and a Wi-Fi module to 
transfer measured data on the cloud platform to establish people’s on­
line medical databases. For further research and decision-making, the 
obtained data may be routinely updated and shared with hospitals, 
doctors, and other healthcare providers anywhere in the globe. Using 
this portable equipment, they may provide high-quality healthcare 
services to people living in remote areas. The device’s created prototype 
was lightweight, convenient, and portable. 
Dimitrievski, Filiposka [69] suggested developing a low-energy 
LoRa-based IoT infrastructure for rural healthcare. To demonstrate the 
restrictions placed in low connection locations, they detailed a number 
of user tales. They then created a design that would function within the 
limitations. The absence of infrastructure for smart homes, the uneven 
distribution of dwellings in rural regions, and the high cost of home 
conversion were all taken into account in the design. As a result, it was 
believed that batteries would power IoT sensors and that servicing 
would be uncommon. They conducted tests demonstrating that, based 
on the usage profile of the IoT node, external Ultra-Low-Power (ULP) 
timers may be utilized to prolong battery life in the order of tens of 
times. They also recommended some energy-saving measures. While 
ULP deep sleep states can significantly lengthen battery life, a system’s 
usefulness is measured by how responsive it is when called upon. For 
this, they suggested wake-up triggers for the sensors and micro­
controllers. In order to enable zero energy sensors, some observed events 
could function as triggers by creating an electrical charge or closing an 
open circuit. Events are detected and set off by sensors that recognize 
mechanical changes, such as pressure connections. A microcontroller in 
sleep mode is resumed by sending very low-power wake-up signals. 
These triggers include wake-up signals for sound and light. 
Hooda, Ramesh [70] concentrated on the medical field in the village 
of Morasiya in the Bihar district of Bhojpur (India). As part of the Live- 
In-Labs® program, a team of instructors and pupils spent a week 
assessing the residents’ health in the village. The team investigated the 
causes of the alarmingly bad health of Morasiya’s residents and exam­
ined local treatment practices and services offered by the government- 
funded Public Health Centre. The absence of a local health clinic, 
carelessness regarding nutrition and personal hygiene, and a dearth of 
medical personnel were all suggested as the main reasons for the peas­
ants’ poor health. They came up with a solution to their health issues 
using co-design technologies. An IoT-based Amrita Smart Health Assis­
tant (ASHA) system was created to track and upload data securely 
through MQTT to the cloud to remotely monitor community health in 
villages. 
Giri, Roy [71] suggested a structure that would send out a warning if 
the impacted population in a certain area went beyond a predetermined 
limit. They created a structure based on Wireless Body Area Networks 
(WBANs) and sensors to gather the patients’ real-time bodily vital in­
dicators. They suggested breaking up a territory comprising multiple 
villages into smaller sections containing many medical kiosks staffed by 
healthcare professionals. Each kiosk has a variety of sensors and other 
electronic medical equipment for detecting body temperature, heart­
beats, blood pressure, and other bodily characteristics. These gadgets 
measure the villagers’ bodily characteristics, and the network compiles 
and monitors the data. An epidemic alarm was created in a specific area 
if more than a certain threshold of villagers reported symptoms of the 
specified disease. This threshold value was determined using the cu­
mulative patient data of the area and reached the relevant health agency 
in real time. On a real-time basis, it also showed the number of infected, 
semi-infected, and uninfected patients. Their use has the potential to 
considerably aid in the detection and containment of epidemics in 
afflicted regions if it is widely adopted. 
A total of six significant papers underwent scrutiny within the 
intelligent service section, with a focus on various facets. The merits and 
limitations of these articles have been succinctly outlined in Table 5. The 
paramount advantages observed in this category encompass heightened 
security, precision, and efficacy. Conversely, the most notable drawback 
lies in limited scalability. 
5. Results and discussion 
Health is often described as invaluable, and indeed, good health is 
fundamental for the survival of humanity. The evolution of the health­
care industry has closely paralleled human development throughout 
history. In the contemporary era, driven by remarkable advancements in 
science and technology, the medical and healthcare fields have achieved 
significant milestones. These include innovations in remote medical 
diagnostics, pandemic forecasting, and remote patient health moni­
toring. The emergence of 5th-generation communication networks in 
the early 2020s laid the foundation for the Internet of Things (IoT) 
concept. Moreover, the anticipated arrival of 6th generation communi­
cation networks (referred to as 6G) in 2030 is poised to usher in the next 
phase of the IoT revolution, encompassing autonomous IoT systems and 
a multitude of internally intelligent applications designed to serve hu­
manity [72]. Among the domains set to benefit significantly is the field 
of smart healthcare. This study embarks on a comprehensive review of 
intelligent IoT-based healthcare systems in rural communities and their 
associated governance structures. Relevant literature has been carefully 
selected and thoroughly examined. Finally, this exploration delves into 
the challenges and unresolved issues and offers a glimpse into the future 
research directions awaiting exploration in this critical domain. 
In today’s fast-paced world, where time is a precious commodity, 
Y. Ge et al.

individuals, especially the working class, often find themselves caught in 
a whirlwind of tasks, neglecting their health and fitness. Even a simple 
clinic visit can become time-consuming, involving a series of tests, di­
agnoses, prescriptions, and treatments. Consequently, many people only 
seek medical attention when grappling with severe illnesses. As a result, 
more individuals are exploring alternatives, such as wearable health 
monitoring devices. These devices, worn on the body, offer the promise 
of continuous real-time health monitoring coupled with timely insights 
into various health parameters. They aim to empower both users and 
their physicians with vital health information. Rural healthcare poses a 
formidable challenge globally, particularly in developing countries 
where more than 55 % of the population resides in rural areas. In this 
context, IoT emerges as a precious tool. The IoT, driven by data transfer 
and automation, represents one of the fastest-growing technologies. It 
encompasses a network of sensors, cyber systems tailored for IoT, and 
cloud computing [73]. This dynamic ecosystem collaborates at every 
step to deliver real-time information to the right individuals. In rural 
settings, ensuring timely medication for patients becomes crucial, and 
the IoT can prove immensely beneficial in this regard. However, it is 
essential to note that IoT users are also actively exploring authentication 
improvements to enhance security. Given the acute shortage of trained 
healthcare personnel and the substantial cost of establishing govern­
ment healthcare facilities, delivering adequate healthcare services in 
rural and remote areas remains daunting [74]. 
The provision of healthcare facilities presents a significant challenge, 
particularly in developing countries where remote and rural regions 
grapple with a scarcity of high-quality hospitals and medical experts. As 
the modern age witnesses the transformative power of artificial intelli­
gence across various domains, healthcare is no exception. Health-related 
issues and complications continue to increase, necessitating innovative 
approaches to monitoring and addressing these concerns. One such 
innovative approach is wireless health monitoring, a contemporary 
concept that leverages wireless technology. In wireless health moni­
toring systems, diverse technologies come into play, including wearable 
sensors, portable remote health systems, wireless communication net­
works, and expert systems. The intrinsic value of life is undeniable, yet a 
lack of awareness about diseases and limited access to healthcare sys­
tems leave many lives hanging in the balance. In this context, the 
Internet of Things (IoT) is a vital tool for disease detection and patient 
treatment. However, while telemedicine, facilitated by IoT, brings 
numerous advantages, it is not without its challenges. Providers, payers, 
and policymakers are acutely aware of the complexities that can be 
difficult to navigate. As healthcare IoT is poised for exponential growth 
in the coming decade, it will usher in a host of practical and techno­
logical challenges [75]. For instance, a review of the existing literature 
reveals that while Healthcare IoT has significantly expanded the realm 
of possibilities for addressing healthcare needs, several hurdles remain. 
These challenges include creating adaptable, suitable, energy-efficient, 
and secure systems that effectively cater to health requirements. Effec­
tively driving this transformation will necessitate close collaboration 
between the software and hardware communities, culminating in sub­
stantial technological advancements [76]. 
The comprehensive development of a nation is intricately linked to 
the effectiveness of its healthcare systems, which are essential for 
providing fundamental medical services to its populace. Technological 
advancements have made it possible to build intelligent systems with 
strong communication and data-gathering capabilities, opening up a 
multitude of possibilities for various IoT applications, particularly in 
healthcare systems [37,77]. In vast countries predominantly charac­
terized by rural regions, the provision of medical facilities and health­
care services presents a significant challenge. This challenge is 
exacerbated by the shortage of healthcare personnel and the absence of 
essential logistics and minimal infrastructure. As a result, the rural 
populace finds itself grappling with severe repercussions, including the 
necessity to travel to urban centers for even rudimentary medical 
checkups, exorbitant medical expenses, and costly accommodation, 
among other issues. Telemedicine emerges as a promising solution to 
address this last-mile problem, bridging the gap by delivering essential 
medical services to remote rural populations [78]. IoT technology en­
hances the flexibility and future upgradability of this monitoring system. 
For example, Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) has greatly benefited from 
the nearly universal availability of powerful smartphones and the 
extremely high data rates made possible by broadband and mobile 
networks. However, many consumers cannot afford these technologies. 
IoT systems have the potential to make these advantages accessible to 
underprivileged consumers, even when using limited user devices and 
connections. However, these solutions must safeguard personal health 
information and deliver a reasonable level of service [79]. The con­
nected healthcare paradigm holds promise for lowering healthcare ex­
penditures and improving access, but it is important to address the 
challenges rural populations face in realizing these benefits. 
IoT provides a seamless connection between medical equipment, 
sensors, and healthcare professionals, facilitating the delivery of top-tier 
medical services across diverse locations. The advent of IoT-based real- 
time health monitoring systems has ushered in significant enhancements 
in the well-being of individuals in both urban and rural environments. 
This transformative technology has led to remarkable improvements in 
patient safety, reduced healthcare costs, expanded access to healthcare 
services, and enhanced efficiency and productivity within the healthcare 
sector. Continuous monitoring of villages and timely reporting of 
epidemic breakouts or other dangerous diseases in rural and distant 
areas are examples of how IoT can greatly assist [71]. However, many of 
these solutions are ineffective in underdeveloped nations due to the lack 
of reliable communication systems [53]. Identifying the source of an 
outbreak and issuing timely notifications are crucial for successful 
control and containment. Controlling the outbreak becomes more 
challenging if a pandemic spreads to rural regions with inadequate 
network access and healthcare facilities. Therefore, there is a need for a 
rapid and effective alarm system to manage the emergence of dangerous 
illnesses and minimize their spread. Epidemics can spread rapidly, and 
their consequences can be long-lasting. In some cases, their toll can in­
crease exponentially. 
In conclusion, IoT plays a significant role in improving the health of 
remote and rural areas’ health, including reducing treatment time and 
cost. However, due to the limited training of employees and operators in 
less developed countries, as well as the high costs of implementing IoT 
infrastructure in rural areas, the use of this technology remains a major 
challenge for many remote regions. It is hoped that in the not-too-distant 
future, people in any part of the world will be able to make optimal use 
of smart IoT health technologies. Finally, Fig. 5 provides a comparative 
analysis of the critical factors gleaned from the literature reviewed in 
Section 3. The findings reveal that numerous articles have made 
concerted efforts to enhance real-time efficiency, reliability, security, 
and feasibility. However, it is noteworthy that certain articles grapple 
with scalability, reliability, and latency issues. Furthermore, the 
graphical representation underscores a prevalent trend where most 
attained results have focused on optimizing efficiency and curbing costs. 
6. Open issue 
While intelligent technologies usher in new prospects for IoT-based 
smart services, they also give rise to emerging challenges and unre­
solved issues. In the continuation of this section, the open challenges in 
this area will be examined in three groups, including monitoring, 
intelligent service, and body sensor networks. 
6.1. Intelligent service 
Cities, towns, and suburban areas are becoming more interconnected 
due to the desire to improve connectivity in emerging and underdevel­
oped nations. This tendency would soon pick up speed, especially when 
5G networks were being pushed. However, as rural societies are getting 
Y. Ge et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
Artificial Intelligence In Medicine 146 (2023) 102702
11
smaller and the population’s average age is rising, network providers do 
not focus on ensuring connection. Solutions for direct cloud access, 
including mobile and satellite internet, are too costly [80,81]. Addi­
tionally, due to the sparsely populated character of rural areas and 
farmlands, cable and Wi-Fi networks are technologically unviable 
because of signal degradation [69]. 
Moreover, cloud/fog computing is critical when the volume of IoT 
data and data is essential. Hence, it would be unable to endure the forced 
solo power of IoT. To advance the goals of the developing IoT and the 
forthcoming Internet, the cloud of things is an IoT integration of cloud 
computing or fog computing [82]. Fog computing is a network-wide 
application of the cloud computing paradigm, making it suitable for 
IoT and other systems needing immediate and essential interactions. 
While interfering with numerous intelligent things in human life, 
intelligent building monitoring and others supply almost unlimited tools 
and facilities. However, it also confronts a variety of issues. The three 
most important considerations are mobility, response time, and spatial 
awareness. Fog and mobile edge computing have been created to solve 
these cloud computing problems [63,83]. 
6.2. Monitoring 
A community IoT healthcare access system’s implementation costs 
must be calculated for individual nations. The total cost will depend on 
base station expenses, the number of access points needed to cover a 
specific area, licensing fees, and the specialized knowledge required to 
construct a system [29]. Therefore, connected health is anticipated to 
save costs while introducing improvements in healthcare delivery and 
doctor-patient communication. The healthcare quality gap between 
metropolitan regions with superior provider communication and phys­
ical closeness and the section of rural societies with various connection 
concerns will widen significantly due to connected health [69]. 
Despite its many potential benefits, intelligent IoT poses security and 
privacy risks. As the data is collected from connected devices, it is 
vulnerable to malicious attacks. Furthermore, healthcare organizations 
must protect patient’s personal and private data. As such, an effective 
data security strategy must be in place to ensure that all the gathered 
data is securely transmitted and stored. Additionally, patient-generated 
data should also be encrypted to ensure privacy. Intelligent IoT provides 
numerous benefits to healthcare organizations, including improved ac­
curacy and productivity. This technology can also help to reduce med­
ical costs and improve patient outcomes. However, to ensure the safety 
and security of intelligent IoT, healthcare providers must ensure that 
their systems are adequately secured and that their data security pro­
tocols are regularly updated. By properly utilizing intelligent IoT and 
enforcing the necessary security measures, healthcare organizations can 
be assured that their data remains secure and that their patients are 
provided with the best possible care. Additionally, with this work, 
healthcare practitioners will be able to identify the potential security 
and data privacy challenges associated with IOT and how to address 
them [84]. Hence, integrating IoT into existing healthcare systems will 
necessitate a combination of factors, including policy support, 
cybersecurity-centric standards, meticulous strategic planning, and 
well-defined regulations within healthcare institutions. Blockchain 
technology has emerged as a promising solution to bolster IoT imple­
mentation in healthcare settings [85]. Blockchain can play a pivotal role 
in ensuring the transparency and security of patient records, stream­
lining drug traceability, and enhancing the efficiency of data sharing. To 
ascertain real-world security assurances, future research endeavors 
should evaluate the integration of blockchain and IoT within a testable 
system [86]. 
6.3. Body sensor networks 
The remote health management system enabled by IoT offers many 
advantages compared to conventional health monitoring systems [87]. 
However, despite these benefits, several persistent challenges impede 
IoT’s progress. These key obstacles encompass issues related to usability, 
portability, interoperability, information security, and privacy concerns 
[37]. Energy management emerges as a paramount concern within the 
IoT ecosystem. Energy efficiency represents a critical hurdle in the 
effective utilization of IoT technologies. Moreover, the potential surge in 
power demand, an aspect previously overlooked, is an emerging feature 
of IoT [88,89]. IoT significantly influences energy efficiency, high­
lighting the shift toward interconnected devices [90]. Adopting hierar­
chical and collaborative systems becomes imperative to surmount these

challenges and facilitate the seamless transition toward an IoT-driven 
future. These systems are instrumental in ensuring high levels of con­
sistency in core aspects such as latency, availability, and real-time an­
alytics, ultimately unlocking the full potential of IoT [48]. Moreover, IoT 
nodes often run on batteries. Designing effective battery-saving pro­
cedures employing sleep modes while the node is idle is crucial due to 
several limitations in rural locations [69]. 
Surprisingly, the IoT technologies brought about by the explosive 
proliferation of smartphones and wearable technology are revolution­
izing healthcare, moving it away from the old hub-based structure and 
toward a more individualized healthcare system [91]. Given the many 
issues in the field, enhancing the efficacy of sophisticated IoT technol­
ogies is still quite difficult: a dearth of affordable, unstandardized IoT 
systems, the multidimensionality of produced data, accurate smart 
medical sensors, heterogeneity of linked wearable devices, and strict 
compatibility needs [35]. By considering the necessity of distributing 
responsibilities between the sensor network and a remote healthcare 
center, the introduction of an intelligent e-health gateway can effec­
tively tackle various challenges within ubiquitous healthcare systems. 
These challenges encompass scalability, energy consumption, and us­
ability [92]. 
7. Conclusion and limitations 
In order to facilitate a comprehensive understanding of IoT’s sig­
nificance in rural healthcare, an in-depth analysis of primary IoT 
research was conducted by examining prevalent keywords in the liter­
ature were reviewed. Through the use of an SLR approach, valuable 
insights into the potential of IoT in shaping personalized, intelligent, and 
efficient healthcare systems in rural areas were gained. The findings 
reveal a notable increase in the number of articles published since 2017, 
indicating a trend that is likely to continue into the foreseeable future. 
Additionally, our analysis of publication distribution across academic 
journals highlights the prominent roles played by IEEE, Springer, and 
Elsevier in advancing IoT research and solidifying its position as a 
lasting tradition within the healthcare domain. This review provides a 
curated selection of noteworthy publications in the relevant literature, 
offering academics a profound understanding of IoT applications in rural 
healthcare. Recognizing the pioneering works and their authors has the 
potential to inspire fresh directions and collaborative research initia­
tives, thereby enhancing the quality of research outputs. Moreover, by 
illustrating how digital health technologies can connect disadvantaged 
individuals in rural regions with urban health facilities staffed by highly 
trained personnel, this study can assist policymakers in realizing the 
potential for improving health equality. 
Conversely, the multifaceted applications of IoT technology have 
ushered in a new era of convenience and safety in our lives. In recent 
years, scholars have increasingly directed their attention toward cutting- 
edge technologies such as cloud computing, blockchain, artificial in­
telligence (AI), and wireless body sensor networks. Integrating these 
advanced technologies with IoT promises to deliver precise diagnoses, 
treatment recommendations, comprehensive physiological data collec­
tion, and cost savings in healthcare. The vast potential of IoT technology 
empowers us to address real-time health challenges from all corners of 
our lives. Consequently, medical devices are progressively inter­
connected, enhancing the overall patient experience and enabling rapid 
responses to critical emergencies. 
Furthermore, the presence of IoT in the healthcare sector has 
prompted investigators across the globe to develop intelligent software 
such as mobile healthcare apps, health-aware advice systems, and smart 
healthcare networks. In addition, ML and soft computing methods can 
aid in recognition and illness detection. In rural locations where the 
healthcare infrastructure and physical connectivity to the outside world 
are often weak and limited, early diagnosis of epidemics is essential for 
their containment and prevention. To address such situations, notifica­
tions can be sent to the relevant authorities for a quick response if a 
comprehensive and up-to-date estimate of the affected population in a 
specific region can be determined. IoT applications enable real-time data 
collection using sensors and mobile devices at various sites and health 
facilities around villages. 
7.1. Limitations 
This review study is not without its limitations, which warrant 
consideration. Most notably, our selection criteria focused exclusively 
on papers initially published in English. This approach may potentially 
limit the overall scope and relevance of the study. Future research en­
deavors should consider including publications in other languages to 
broaden the study’s applicability. Furthermore, some pertinent works 
may have been inadvertently omitted due to the specific search terms 
employed in this study. To mitigate this limitation, researchers could 
explore broader search terms encompassing a wider spectrum of IoT and 
healthcare-related terminology. Additionally, we recommend exploring 
alternative bibliometric approaches, such as main path analysis and 
topic modeling, to enrich the body of literature in this domain.

Healthcare facilities in isolated rural areas of sub-Saharan Africa face challenges in providing essential health 
services due to unreliable energy access. This study examines the use of hybrid renewable energy systems 
consisting of solar PV, wind turbines, batteries, and hydrogen storage for the electrification of rural healthcare 
facilities in Nigeria and South Africa. The study deployed the efficacy of Hybrid Optimization of Multiple Energy 
Resources software for techno-economic analysis and the Evaluation based on the Distance from Average So­
lution method for multi-criteria decision-making for sizing, optimizing, and selecting the optimal energy system. 
Results show that the optimal configurations achieve cost-effective levelized energy costs ranging from $0.336 to 
$0.410/kWh for both countries. For the Nigeria case study, the optimal energy system includes 5 kW PV, 10 kW 
fuel cell, 10 kW inverter, 10 kW electrolyzer, and 16 kg hydrogen tank. South Africa’s optimal configuration has 
5 kW PV, 10 kW battery, 10 kW inverter, and 7.5 kW rectifier. Solar PV provides more than 90 % of energy, with 
dual axis tracking yielding the highest output: 8,889kWh/yr for Nigeria and 10,470kWh/yr for South Africa. The 
multi-criteria decision-making analysis reveals that Nigeria’s preferred option is the hybrid system without 
tracking. In contrast, the horizontal axis, weekly adjustment tracking configuration is optimal for South Africa, 
considering technical, economic, and environmental criteria. The findings highlight the importance of context- 
specific optimization for hybrid renewable energy systems in rural healthcare facilities to accelerate Sustain­
able Development Goals 3 and 7.   
Introduction 
Just like potable water, energy is one of the critical products on 
which the sustenance of modern civilization depends; virtually all 
human activities require energy as input. Energy, especially electricity, 
is a driver of goods and services, offered in the: industrial 
(manufacturing), banking, academic, agricultural, and health sectors; it 
is, therefore, inevitable to modern man [3]. Various initiatives have 
been implemented globally to improve electricity access. Although there 
was a 10.5 % decrease in the global population without access to elec­
tricity from 2018 to 2019, almost 770 million people worldwide still do 
not have this crucial service as of 2019 [1]. According to the Interna­
tional Energy Agency, Sub-Saharan Africa has the largest population of 
individuals lacking access to electricity, surpassing all other continents 
[26]. 
The success that resulted in the decline in the number of people 
without electricity between 2018 and 2019, could be attributed to the 
momentum gained by adopting decentralized renewable-based solu­
tions. The number of electricity consumers, powered by decentralized 
grid systems (nano, mini, and micro), has grown from 5 million in 2010 
to 11 million in 2019; this is more than 100 percent increment [47]. 
Despite the various efforts put in place to increase electricity access 
globally, it is projected that globally, the ripple effects of the COVID-19 
pandemic will keep nearly 660 million people (with the majority in sub- 
Saharan Africa) without electricity by the year 2030 [47]. While since 
2013, sub-Saharan Africa has experienced a continuous decline in the 
number of residents without electricity, this success is set to be reversed, 
thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has pulled 
many countries away from the orbit of attaining universal access to

electricity by the year 2030. 
Based on the foregoing, it could be seen that as the year 2030 target 
for the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 7 draws 
closer, various measures would have to be deployed by the various 
stakeholders in the energy sector to achieve sustainable and affordable 
energy for all. One of the measures includes extending the centralized 
electricity grid (top–bottom approach) to areas with no access but with 
the required number of customers necessary to break even [10]. In cases 
where utility companies are not projected to profit, adopting decen­
tralized grid systems is proposed as a bottom-top approach to attaining 
SDG 7 [10]. Most of these decentralized energy systems are based on 
renewable energy sources, such as solar PV, wind turbines, and diesel 
generators for hybridization [6]. Various advantages of adopting 
renewable energy sources in grid decentralization have been discussed 
in the literature. The adoption of a renewable energy-based decentral­
ized approach would not only slow down the depletion of conventional 
energy sources, but it would also reduce the emission of greenhouse 
gases [45]. It would also aid in the elimination of transmission losses, 
reduction of poverty, creation of jobs, and most importantly, it could 
improve the living standards of the host communities [21]. 
The availability of reliable, clean, and affordable electricity is also a 
major component of operating clinics and healthcare facilities [8]). For 
example, for an efficient distribution of temperature-sensitive medica­
tions, such as anti-retroviral drugs and vaccines, there is a need for 
adequate refrigeration, which can only be possible with reliable elec­
tricity. Another important aspect of reliable electricity in the health 
sector is for illumination and operating basic medical equipment, 
especially for patients requiring emergency care and during child de­
livery. As reported in the literature [38], the availability of reliable 
electricity in healthcare facilities can reduce the loss of lives and 
improve the quality of life; this is one of the significant targets of SDG 
number 3. With the COVID-19 pandemic that ravaged havoc across the 
globe, healthcare facilities were overburdened and were expected to 
cope with the pressures from COVID-19 patients; this is in addition to 
carrying out routine procedures for other patients. 
Various studies have highlighted the profound effects of energy 
poverty on Sub-Saharan Africa’s socioeconomic growth [27]. Lack of 
access to dependable electricity reduces the prospects for good health 
care, obstructs economic output, and widens the already-existing dis­
parities between those with access and those without access to elec­
tricity [15]. These studies highlight how energy poverty and more so, 
general development objectives are intertwined. Access to reliable and 
sustainable energy is essential for improving healthcare, especially in 
the isolated and underdeveloped areas of Sub-Saharan Africa [39]. The 
confluence of energy poverty and healthcare concerns in these regions 
demands creative solutions to closing the gap and improving community 
wellbeing. Sub-Saharan Africa faces numerous energy-related issues, 
ranging from unstable power sources to insufficient infrastructure [17].

This study aims to fill the research gap by investigating the feasibility 
and optimality of hybrid renewable energy systems integrating solar PV, 
wind turbines, batteries, and hydrogen storage for rural healthcare fa­
cilities in sub-Saharan Africa. The novelty of this work lies in the 
comprehensive techno-economic analysis, the evaluation of different 
solar tracking configurations, and the application of a multi-criteria 
decision-making (MCDM) approach using the EDAS method to assess 
the trade-offs between system parameters and performance. 
This study makes three main contributions. First, it presents a 
detailed framework for designing and optimizing hybrid renewable 
energy systems for rural healthcare facilities, considering two energy 
storage technologies and seven solar tracking configurations. Second, it 
identifies the optimal system configurations for two locations in sub- 
Saharan Africa, considering site-specific renewable energy resources, 
healthcare facility energy demands, and economic parameters. Lastly, 
the study introduces the EDAS method for MCDM that allows for the 
evaluation of trade-offs between technical, economic, and environ­
mental criteria when selecting the most suitable hybrid system config­
urations for the two locations. 
The results of this study offer valuable insights into developing sus­
tainable energy solutions for healthcare facilities in rural areas of sub- 
Saharan Africa. This will contribute to the overarching efforts to attain 
Sustainable Development Goals 3 and 7. The methods and insights can 
be extended to other regions with comparable challenges, emphasizing 
the significance of context-specific optimization and decision-making 
for hybrid renewable energy systems. 
Literature review 
Several recent studies have focused on the implementation of hybrid 
renewable energy systems in rural healthcare facilities (Kohol´
e et al., 
2024). These studies have examined the technical, economic, and 
environmental factors involved in combining solar PV, wind turbines, 
diesel generators, and energy storage technologies to deliver reliable 
and environmentally friendly electricity to health centers that are not 
connected to the central power grid. However, the existing literature 
lacks a comprehensive analysis of the impact of advanced energy storage 
technologies, such as batteries and hydrogen, and the role of solar 
tracking configurations in optimizing the performance of hybrid 
systems. 
Yakub et al., explored the use of HRES to improve electricity access 
in rural Nigerian healthcare institutions affected by the COVID-19 
pandemic [48]. The HOMER Pro and RETScreen Expert software were 
employed to determine the most viable and cost-effective solution en­
ergy system. Results show that solar-diesel HRES can save about 
$30,583 per year, with a net present value of $390,949, a 1.3-year 
payback period, a 75-ton CO2 emission reduction, and $30,583 in 
annual savings over the initial diesel system. An inherent drawback of 
the study conducted by [48] is the consideration of a single energy 
storage technology. The inclusion of battery and hydrogen storage 
technologies could significantly enhance the reliability and dispatch­
ability of the HES, particularly during periods of low renewable energy 
availability. 
In another study, Islam et al., conducted a techno-economic analysis 
of a hybrid solar-diesel microgrid system for a rural healthcare facility in 
Bangladesh [29]. The authors used the HOMER software to design a 32 
kW rooftop solar PV system with a bi-directional inverter and a 28 kW 
generator to suit the facility’s energy requirements. The economic study 
revealed that the net present cost was $33,818 at a levelized cost of 
$0.022/kWh. Compared to the high fuel prices and the pollution from 
conventional diesel generators alone, the hybrid system was a practical, 
cost-effective alternative for providing reliable electricity to the rural 
healthcare center. 
Babatunde et al., designed optimal hybrid renewable energy systems 
for rural healthcare institutions in Nigeria, incorporating solar, wind, 
diesel generators, and battery storage [14]. PV/diesel/battery was 
considered the most viable configuration across all geographies, with a 
net present cost of between $12,779-$13,646, at between 70–80 % 
renewable portion, and energy costs ranging from $0.507 to $0.542/ 
kWh. A sensitivity study of diesel prices and interest rates investigated 
the impact of withdrawing fuel subsidies in Nigeria. The hybrid system 
has been proven to be the best cost-effective alternative for off-grid 
healthcare institutions in Nigeria. While this study examined battery 
storage, it did not investigate the potential of hydrogen as an energy 
storage medium or the impact of solar tracking on energy production. By 
using the HOMER software, Ighravwe et al., devised a framework to 
determine the most effective hybrid renewable energy systems (HRES) 
for ensuring sustainable healthcare services in Nigeria [28]. By 
employing a multi-criteria decision analysis, incorporating technical, 
economic, and environmental criteria, the authors determined that the 
operational and total net present costs were the least and most signifi­
cant factors, respectively. Six communities’ evaluations of the frame­
work indicated that a PV-diesel battery was the optimal HRES option. 
This research fills the void in knowledge regarding integrating health­
care delivery and energy access objectives to facilitate data-driven HRES 
planning for off-grid healthcare facilities. Although this study offers a 
significant foundation for decision-making, it is limited in terms of the 
depth of technical analysis and the inclusion of hydrogen energy storage 
technology. The study does not provide detailed simulations or opti­
mization of the hybrid system configurations, limiting the understand­
ing of their performance and feasibility. 
Furthermore, Olatomiwa et al. designed optimal hybrid renewable 
energy systems for rural healthcare centers in Nigeria that lack reliable 
electricity. By using the HOMER software and long-term meteorological 
data, they found in Sokoto and Jos, a high wind potential and a strong 
solar potential, nationwide. The techno-economic analysis determined 
the fact that the PV/wind/diesel/battery systems were optimal for 
Iseyin, Sokoto, Maiduguri, Jos, and Enugu, while the PV/diesel/battery 
was best for Port Harcourt, based on the local renewable resources. 
Although this research offered significant insights regarding the 
viability of hybrid systems in rural healthcare facilities, it did not 
consider the integration of hydrogen storage or the impact of solar 
tracking on system performance. 
Abundant wind and solar make hybrid systems ideal for improving 
electricity access, healthcare delivery and reducing maternal and child 
mortalities in the off-grid rural areas of Nigeria. By using the Homer Pro 
software, Chowdhury et al., developed an ideal hybrid renewable energy 
system for a temporary COVID-19 healthcare facility in Bangladesh 
[18]. When compared to diesel-only systems, the PV/converter/wind/ 
battery/diesel generator configuration reduced expenses and emissions. 
An economic analysis with a seven-year payback period revealed a 
levelized cost of $0.4688/kWh, and 35 % less than solar household 
systems. When compared to a diesel-only system, the hybrid system 
produced 27 % less CO2, making it environmentally friendly. Healthcare 
institutions’ energy needs are increasing, and optimized hybrid renew­
able energy systems can assist in fulfilling that demand, while lowering 
costs and emissions. 
Raghuwanshi and Arya used the HOMER software to design and 
optimize a stand-alone hybrid solar PV system for a rural healthcare 
facility in India [41]. An economic study revealed that the PV-diesel- 
battery system had higher starting costs of $2,418, but lower net pre­
sent costs of $13,523, when compared to $879 and $20,515 for diesel- 
battery. The hybrid system was more cost-effective and environmen­
tally favorable than standard diesel. The results show that renewable 
energy systems can be feasible for providing dependable, cost-effective 
power to off-grid healthcare institutions in remote places. However, 
the study did not consider the integration of wind energy or hydrogen 
storage, limiting its applicability to regions with high solar potential. In 
a similar study, the authors employed the Markov and frequency- 
duration models to assess the reliability of stand-alone hybrid solar PV 
systems in remote places [42]. The diesel-only, PV/battery, and PV/ 
diesel/battery setups were evaluated for failure rate, downtime,

unavailability, energy not supplied, and loss of load probability. Due to 
solar resources and the load demand, the hybrid PV/battery/diesel 
achieved the highest reliability indices. The results showed that hybrid 
systems are more reliable than diesel-only systems in off-grid scenarios. 
The framework assists the policymakers in determining the best strate­
gies for energizing rural healthcare facilities. The main emphasis of the 
study was the evaluation of reliability, with little consideration given to 
the economic and environmental consequences associated with the 
various configurations of the systems. Furthermore, the study does not 
explore the potential of hydrogen storage or the impact of solar tracking 
on system performance and reliability. 
Olatomiwa et al., designed optimized hybrid grid-connected systems 
that incorporated diesel and renewable energy sources to address the 
insufficient electricity supply at rural Nigerian healthcare institutions 
[37]. Simulations using meteorological data and load profiles from six 
locations showed that solar-wind-diesel systems could meet the demand 
at low prices of between $0.0588–0.115/kWh and with good reliability. 
Most of the generation was produced by wind and solar power. To 
optimize the operation of hybrid renewable energy systems, linked to an 
unreliable grid that supplies healthcare facilities in rural Nigeria, Ade­
toro et al., assessed various dispatch strategies [4]. A comparison was 
made between the enhanced combined dispatch (ECD) strategy and the 
load following (LF) and cycle charging (CC) strategies. ECD facilitated 
the most efficient energy allocation, considering resource availability, 
demand, and grid reliability. When compared to CC and LF, ECD 
attained the lowest levelized cost of $0.148/kWh and a net present cost 
of $1.99 million through significant reductions in CO2, CO, SO2, and 
NOx emissions. The study primarily examined the operational aspects of 
the hybrid systems, excluding economic and decision-making 
considerations. 
This study examines the viability of hybrid renewable energy sys­
tems integrating solar PV, wind turbines, batteries, and hydrogen stor­
age for rural healthcare institutions in sub-Saharan Africa. Although 
hybrid systems for healthcare facilities have been the subject of earlier 
research, this study stands out by performing in-depth techno-economic 
analysis for two specific cases in South Africa and Nigeria. Additionally, 
the study assesses how various solar tracking configurations affect the 
viability and performance of the hybrid systems, offering fresh per­
spectives on optimizing renewable energy sources. In addition, this 
study utilizes a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach called 
the EDAS method to evaluate the trade-offs between various tracking 
configurations and system parameters. The environmental benefits and 
alignment of the proposed systems with the Sustainable Development 
Goals (SDGs) and climate change mitigation efforts are also discussed, 
emphasizing the innovative and significant nature of this research. 
Materials and methods 
This section outlines the strategy employed to accomplish the 
research objective. It describes the different steps used in the HOMER 
software to simulate the proposed hybrid renewable energy system 
(HRES). The proposed energy system consists of solar PV, wind turbines, 
batteries, fuel cells, and hydrogen tanks (Fig. 1). The methodology uti­
lized in this study is unique in a variety of respects. The hybrid system 
designs examined in this study combine a unique mix of technologies, 
such as solar PV, wind turbines, batteries, and hydrogen storage. In 
addition, the research considered various solar tracking configurations 
(NT, HADA, HAMA, HAWA, TA, VACA, HACA) to assess their potential 
impact on the system’s performance. Furthermore, the EDAS method is 
utilized for MCDM analysis, offering an alternative perspective on 
assessing the trade-offs among various system parameters and tracking 
configurations. This comprehensive methodology allows for a full 
evaluation of the practicality and improvement of hybrid renewable 
energy systems for healthcare facilities in remote areas. 
Hybrid optimization of Multiple Energy Resources 
This study utilized the Hybrid Optimization of Multiple Energy Re­
sources (HOMER) software to conduct a techno-economic assessment of 
the solar PV/wind/battery/fuel cell off-grid hybrid renewable energy 
system (HRES). HOMER is a software program developed at the National 
Renewable Energy Laboratory to design and optimize microgrids. The 
HOMER enables the users to simulate a variety of components, including 
renewable sources, fossil-powered generators, energy storage systems, 
and loads [11]. The HOMER can assist in identifying the most cost- 
effective and reliable energy configurations through system optimiza­
tion. Its features include renewable energy integration assessment, load 
analysis, sensitivity analysis, and economic assessment. Although the 
HOMER software is the primary tool utilized in this study to assess 
performance and optimize the design of the proposed hybrid renewable

energy system. It is critical to recognize that there are additional opti­
mization techniques that have been implemented in the literature. 
Optimization algorithms such as evolutionary algorithm [32] Mayfly 
Algorithm, Genetic Algorithm (GA), CUKO Search [31] Gray Wolf, 
Constrained Particle Swarm Optimization (CPSO) [43], Harmony Search 
(HS), cultural algorithm (CA) [46], artificial bee colony algorithm [35], 
and Flower Pollination Algorithm (FPA) have been deployed for HRES in 
the literature. These techniques offer unique advantages in terms of 
solution space exploration, convergence speed, and the ability to handle 
complex constraints. 
However, this study selected HOMER software due to its widely 
recognized features and specific suitability for the techno-economic 
analysis of hybrid renewable energy systems. The evaluation of 
various system configurations and identifying optimal solutions are 
made more accessible by HOMER’s user-friendly interface [7], large 
component libraries, and robust optimization algorithms [44]. It is a 
valuable tool for evaluating the viability and effectiveness of hybrid 
systems in various scenarios due to its capacity to carry out sensitivity 
assessments and consider various technical and economic factors [16]. 
Renewable energy resources 
This study considers two locations in the African continent for 
implementing the proposed energy system. The study areas, i.e., Nigeria 
and South Africa solar resource data were acquired through the utili­
zation of the HOMER’s online retrieval system, which was connected to 
the NASA website. The variation of the solar resources in Nigeria 
(Akoka, Lagos) and South Africa (Phelandeba village, Eastern Cape), is 
presented in Fig. 2. It shows that the two locations have considerable 
solar resources. The daily average and the monthly solar irradiation and 
clearness indices of the locations are illustrated in Fig. 3. The mean daily 
solar irradiances in the South African and Nigerian locations are 4.97 
kWh/m2/day and 3.92 kWh/m2, respectively. The maximum and min­
imum solar irradiation recorded in the South African location, are 6.41 
kWh/m2/day in the month of December and 3.55 kWh/m2/day in the 
month of June, respectively. For the Nigerian location, the maximum 
and minimum solar irradiations are recorded in the month of July (5.99 
kWh/m2/day) and in the month of December (1.75 kWh/m2/day). 
Furthermore, the clearness index fluctuated monthly from 0.306 in the 
month of June to 1.815 in the month of December in the South African 
location and between 0.465 (the month of January) and 0.535 (in the 
month of September) in the Nigerian location. 
Fig. 4 presents the monthly average wind speeds (in meters per 
second) for the two locations, South Africa (SA), and Nigeria (NG). In the 
month of January, SA records an average wind speed of 5.88 m/s, 
whereas NG experiences an average speed wind of 2.835 m/s. The 
values fluctuate across the months, reflecting the dynamic nature of the 
wind patterns at the 2 locations. Notably, the month of June experiences 
a substantial increase in SA with an average wind speed of 10.95 m/s, 
while in NG the average wind speed peaks at 4.218 m/s in the month of 
May. These variations are crucial for assessing the wind energy potential 
that informs the decisions that are related to renewable energy projects, 
highlighting the importance of understanding the regional wind speed 
patterns for the effective planning and utilization of wind resources 
throughout the year. 
Load demand 
In assessing the resilience of the proposed HRES, this research was 
centered on a typical primary healthcare load profile. The load profile 
for the healthcare centre was obtained from the literature [13]. The 
medical equipment used in the healthcare centre, includes the: 
Refrigerator-vaccine (RV), Hematology analyzer (HA), Blood chemical 
analyzer (BCA), Refrigerator-nonmedical (RNM), Centrifuge, Micro­
scope, and a CD4 Machine. Other non-medical equipment, includes 
lighting, radio, and functional desktop computers. The energy demand 
of the PHC is calculated by summing the individual electrical-consuming 
appliances’ power by using Eq. (1) [10].

the variable, e represents the specific type of equipment or appliance, 
such as: lighting, heating, refrigerating, or cooling. The variable, f rep­
resents the class, such as: commercial, agricultural, industrial, or 
educational of the equipment. Ne represents the total count of users, 
belonging to class e. Nef represents the quantity of equipment that is 
associated with a particular class. Pef represents the designated electrical 
power capacity of a certain equipment, e within the class, f, while tef 
denotes the total period of usage for each equipment, e within the class f. 
The typical duration of usage ranges between minutes to hours. 
Shown in Fig. 5 is the daily load profile, showing the hourly con­
sumption of the healthcare facility for a typical day in a week. The ex­
amination of the pattern of usage during hospital operations reveals a 
consistent baseline load of ~ 0.1 kWh during the nighttime period, i.e., 
from midnight to 6 am. This load is mostly due to the refrigeration needs 
and the continuous operation of the lighting facilities. The usage shows a 
significant increase, starting at 8 am, coinciding with the commence­
ment of the clinic’s operating hours. The highest level of electricity 
consumption occurs between mid-morning and noon, namely during the 
active patient testing and treatment operations. The range of electricity 
usage during this period is between 0.933 kWh and 1.599 kWh per hour. 
In the evening, when activity decreases, the energy consumption rapidly 
decreases and returns to the overnight baseline of 0.1 kWh; the daily 
average consumption is 12.5 kWh/day. 
System configuration 
This section discusses the technical and economic specifications and 
models adopted in this study. The technical and economic parameters 
are essential in designing a hybrid renewable energy system for a 
healthcare institution, which is presented in Table S1. Each component, 
including PV panels, batteries, wind turbines, fuel cells, Electrolyzers, 
hydrogen tanks, and converters, has specific rated capacities, capital 
costs, replacement costs, O&M expenses, and lifespans. In this study, the 
PV panels used have a power output of 0.25 kW and have a capital cost 
of $295 with a lifespan of 20 years. On the other hand, the battery has a 
voltage rating of 12 V and a capacity of 200Ah. It costs $357 and has a 
lifespan of 4 years. The Fuel Cell has a power output of 1 kW, a capital 
cost of $4000, and a lifespan of 40,000 h. The Electrolyzer under 
consideration has a capacity of 8 kW and a capital cost of $2700, with an 
annual operating and maintenance cost of $3. The Electrolyzer has a 
lifespan of 15 years. The wind turbine has a power rating of 0.4 kW (DC) 
and costs $465 to install. Its annual operation and maintenance cost is 
$5, and it has a lifespan of 15 years. The Hydrogen Tank is essential for 
storing hydrogen generated by the Electrolyzer; it has a capacity of 8 kg, 
a capital cost of $3100, and a lifespan of 25 years. Finally, the Converter 
has a rated capacity of 1 kW, a capital cost of $37, and a lifespan of 10 
years. 
Solar photovoltaic 
Photovoltaic (PV) technology operates by directly converting sun­
light into electricity by using PV modules [2]. PV modules, or solar 
panels, are created by physically and electrically connecting solar cells 
and placing them within a frame. The power output of a photovoltaic 
(PV) module depends on both the specific technology of the module and 
the level of solar irradiance it receives. The power generated by a 
module at a specific moment is directly proportional to the perpendic­
ular intensity of sunlight on the surface of the module [36]. The HOMER 
employes Eq. (2) to determine the PV panel’s power output.

whereYpv is the rated capacity of the PV array , fpv is the PV de-rating

, GT,STC is the solar irradiation incident in a standard condition 
(1kW/m2), αP is the temperature coefficient of power (%/

PV cell temperature (

dard test conditions (

temperature at nominal and actual conditions in degrees Celsius, 
respectively. ηmp,STC indicates the efficiency of the solar system at

%, temperature coefficient of power as −0.5 %/C, nominal operating 
cell temperature is taken as 47 ◦C and the efficiency at standard test 
condition is 13 %. 
Solar photovoltaic (PV) tracking 
Solar PV tracking enables solar panels to dynamically align with the 
sun’s position during the day, resulting in enhanced energy capture, in 
comparison to the stationary tilt systems. The solar tracking configura­
tions [11] that were considered in this study, include:  
i. No Tracking (NT): Solar panels are stationary and do not follow 
the sun’s path; it is the simplest and least expensive choice since it 
uses the least amount of energy.  
ii. Horizontal Axis, Monthly Adjustment (HAMA): The tilt angle of the 
panels is manually adjusted once a month to align with the sun’s 
seasonal angle. The panels rotate on a horizontal north–south 
axis.  
iii. Horizontal Axis, Weekly Adjustment (HAWA): The horizontal axis 
remains constant, while the tilt angle is modified on a weekly 
basis. It enhances energy acquisition in comparison to a monthly 
adjustment scenario but necessitates more frequent manual 
adjustments.  
iv. Horizontal Axis, Daily Adjustment (HADA): The panels undergo 
horizontal rotation, and their tilt is automatically adjusted daily 
to align with the sun’s angle. The energy capture is greatly 
enhanced, however, the costs associated with the system and its 
maintenance also experience a notable increase.  
v. Horizontal Axis, Continuous Adjustment (HACA): Panels tilt and 
rotate continually on a horizontal axis to precisely track the 
location of the sun throughout the day.  
vi. Vertical Axis, Continuous Adjustment (VACA): The panels rotate 
around a vertical axis to follow the sun’s movement from east to 
west, but they do not adjust their angle to match the sun’s 
altitude.  
vii. Two-Axis Tracking (TA): The panels can rotate separately along 
both the horizontal and vertical axes to accurately track the sun’s 
location in any direction. It optimizes the energy collection, while 
simultaneously maximizing the system complexity and expenses. 
Wind turbine 
Wind turbines generate electricity by utilizing the velocity of the air 
to rotate a set of blades. The power produced by a wind turbine is 
dependent on various factors, such as: the wind speed, the length of the 
blades, and the wind turbine power coefficient, which characterize the 
efficiency with which, the turbine transforms wind energy into rota­
tional motion. Eqs. (4) and (5) provide a method for the estimation of 
O.S. Adedoja et al.

the output of a wind turbine [3]. Three stages are required for the 
HOMER to calculate the power output of a wind turbine. They are:  
1. The hourly wind speed is modified from the anemometer height to 
the hub height through the utilization of the logarithmic profile or 
the power law. 
Vh = Vm ×
(Hh
Hm
)β
(4)    
2. The next step entails the estimation of the power produced under 
standard conditions (pressure and temperature) by referencing the 
power curve of the specified wind turbine.  
3. The last step involves the multiplication of the values obtained in the 
second step by the air density to determine the wind power output. 
Po = Po,STP × ρ
ρo
(5)  
The wind speed at the proposed hub height, Hh is denoted as Vh, while 
Vm represents the wind speed, measured at height Hm, where the 
anemometer is located for the wind speed measurement, β is the power 
law exponent (usually taken as 1/7 [33]), ρ is the real density of air, and 
ρo is the density of air at standard temperature and pressure. Po,STP refers 
to the output of the wind turbine at standard temperature and pressure. 
Fuel cell 
The fuel cell, electrolyzer, and hydrogen storage tank make up the 
hydrogen energy system [34]. The equation for the calculation of the 
rate of hydrogen production in an electrolyzer is provided in Eq. (8). The 
hydrogen generated by this procedure is pressurized and stored in a 
hydrogen reservoir. The energy required [9] to compress the hydrogen 
gas, is represented in Eq. (6). The fuel cell is utilized to transform the 
stored hydrogen into electrical energy, and the power generated by a 
fuel cell may be determined [9] by using Eq. (7).

HOMER is an energy simulation software with a powerful integrated 
approach in modeling the performance of fuel cell systems, either 
separately or coupled with electrolyzers. In modeling fuel cell energy 
production, HOMER regards the fuel cells as DC generators. Users can 
define the fuel source as either stored hydrogen produced by an elec­
trolyzer or use an externally-supplied fuel that is reformed. In the latter 
case, the generator module satisfies both the reformer and fuel cell while 
factoring in the costs and efficiency curve on a combined basis. For 
electrolyzer energy consumption, HOMER uses a simplified model that 
assumes constant efficiency: a fixed amount of electricity input will give 
a given amount of hydrogen output. HOMER simulates electrolyzer by 
assuming constant efficiency, meaning that a specific quantity of power 
will consistently produce a specific quantity of hydrogen. The electro­
lyzer has a specified minimum load level, meaning it can only function 
at a capacity as low as 75 % of its maximum rating. Therefore, there is 
the option to adjust the minimum load setting to match this threshold of 
75 %. However, when hydrogen is required for a load or generator, the 
electrolyzer will demand electricity. HOMER calculates fuel cell effi­
ciency based on input fuel consumption data and allows users to enter 
specific fuel cell or electrolyzer data into its fuel curve calculator for 
more precise modeling. 
Storage capacity 
The quantity of batteries required for the energy system is deter­
mined by using Eq. (9), while the capacity of the hydrogen tank, Ch,tank, 
is calculated as the quotient of the load demand and the energy content, 
as described (Babatunde et al., 2022) in Eq. (10).

Battaut represents the battery autonomy, SOSmin represents the min­
imum state of charge of the battery (%), Qn represents the nominal ca­
pacity of a single battery (in Ah), Vn represents the nominal voltage of a 
single battery (in V), nb represents the number of batteries, Haut repre­
sents the autonomy of the hydrogen tank, and LHVh represents the en­
ergy content (lower heating value) of hydrogen, which is 120 MJ/kg. 
Battery lifetime throughput 
Battery lifetime throughput refers to the total amount of energy that 
a battery can deliver or store over its entire operational lifespan. It is a 
crucial metric in evaluating the performance and durability of a battery, 
especially in applications where the battery’s energy storage capacity 
and cycle life are essential factors. Tracking battery lifetime throughput 
helps assess the efficiency and reliability of the battery in meeting the 
energy demands of a particular system or device. HOMER assumes that a 
fixed amount of energy can be cycled through a battery before it requires 
replacement, regardless of the depth of the individual cycles. HOMER 
calculates a value of lifetime throughput (Qlifetime,i) using the following 
equation: 
Qlifetime,i = fidi
( Vn × qmax
1000W/kW
)
(11)  
where di is the depth of discharge (%) fi is the number of cycles to 
failure, and qmax is the maximum capacity of the battery [Ah]. 
Control strategies 
Considering the multi-source nature of the proposed energy system, 
it is necessary to implement an operational strategy to effectively co­
ordinate the flow of energy among the different components. This study 
did implement two dispatch strategies, viz: load following the load 
following (LF) and the cycle-charging (CC) strategies [11]. A dispatch 
strategy refers to a set of rules or actions implemented to regulate the 
functioning of the energy sources and storage components, particularly, 
when the power generated by renewable energy sources is inadequate to 
satisfy the demand. The load-following technique involves the power 
plant producing sufficient energy to meet the load requirements while 
the storage devices remain unchanged. In the cycle-charging mode, the 
generator operates at its maximum rated capacity to meet the load re­
quirements and recharge the storage system with any surplus energy. 
Cost models 
The cost models used for evaluating the renewable energy systems’ 
economic viability are discussed in this section. These include the Total 
Net Present Cost and the Levelized Cost of Energy.

Total net present cost 
The total net present cost (TNPC) of a system is calculated by sub­
tracting the present value of all the revenue it generates over its lifetime 
from the present value of all the costs it incurs over its lifetime. The costs 
encompass the capital expenditures, expenses for replacement, opera­
tion and maintenance, fuel expenditures, penalties for pollution, and the 
expenses associated with current the purchase of electricity from the 
grid. Revenues consist of the value obtained from salvage and the rev­
enue generated from grid sales. By using Eq. (12), the HOMER model can 
estimate the total net present cost. 
TNPC =
TCann
Fcr(i,Xproj
(12)  
where, TCann is the total annual cost incurred, while Fcr is the capital 
recovery factor. i is the interest rate (in %) and Xproj represents the 
project lifespan. This work adopted i as 12 % and Xproj to be 25 years. 
Levelized cost of energy (LCOE) 
The levelized cost of energy (COE) is defined by the HOMER model 
as the average cost per kilowatt-hour (kWh) of the productive electrical 
energy generated by the system. The HOMER utilizes the ratio of the 
yearly cost of electricity production (subtracting the cost of feeding the 
thermal load) to the total useable electric energy production i to 
determine the COE. For this case study, the HOMER employed Eq. (13) 
to calculate the COE. 
LCOE = TCann
TDEM
(13)  
where TDEM is the total amount of electricity demand that was supplied 
by the source of electricity generation. 
Evaluation based on distance from average solution method 
Evaluation based on Distance from Average Solution, or EDAS, is a 
technique applied to study the optimization and the multi-criteria de­
cision-making (MCDM) problems [12]. It assists in assessing and prior­
itizing the available alternatives according to how close they are to the 
average solution. The goal of EDAS is to identify solutions that are both 
close to the average and have high individual performance across mul­
tiple criteria. The distance calculation uses a normalized Euclidean 
distance metric. Assuming there are n alternatives and m criteria, the 
EDAS method can be implemented [23] by using the following steps. 
Step 1: Select the evaluation criteria for a decision-making problem. 
Step 2: Design a decision-making matrix by using the selected 
criteria. 
Step 3: Determine each criterion’s average solution. 
Step 4: Formulate the PDA and NDA matrices for the evaluation 
process. 
Step 5: Generate the alternatives’ weighted sums of PDA and NDA. 
Step 6: Normalize the alternatives’ SP and SN values. 
Step 7: Determine the alternatives’ appraisal score (AS). 
Step 8: Rank the alternatives, based on their appraisal scores by using 
the higher, the better concept. 
Assumptions, Limitations, and uncertainties 
The study assumes that the solar radiation and wind speed data from 
the NASA database accurately reflect the long-term averages for the 
specific areas in Nigeria and South Africa selected for the case study. 
Also, the study applied a day-to-day and time-step-to-time-step random 
variability of 10 % to load demand. It is assumed that the randomness 
would make the load profile more practical and capture the seasonal 
variations. Furthermore, system component technical specifications and 
costs are based on current market data and remain relatively constant. 
Economic parameters are also assumed to be stable over the project 
duration, and the HOMER software’s optimization algorithms and cal­
culations are presumed to be accurate and reliable. 
The study is limited by its reliance on secondary data sources, its 
focus on two specific locations that may not be generalizable to other 
regions, and the exclusion of social, cultural, and institutional factors 
that may affect implementation and adoption. HOMER software’s 
optimization results are based on the specific input parameters and as­
sumptions used in the study, and variations in these inputs may lead to 
different optimal system configurations and techno-economic outcomes. 
Hence, it is proposed that future studies consider the effects of change in 
input parameters on the study’s outcome. This study does not consider 
the social, cultural, and institutional aspects of hybrid renewable energy 
system acceptance and implementation in rural healthcare institutions. 
Furthermore, the results of this study are based on the assumption 
that batteries would be replaced once it reaches its lifetime throughput, 
as calculated by HOMER using Eq. (11). However, it is important to note 
that our analysis does not include a detailed battery degradation model. 
Battery degradation happens because of different things like tempera­
ture, depth of discharge, and charging/discharging rates [40]. As the 
battery degrades, its capacity and performance decrease; this would 
mean they need to be replaced more often and spend more. Future work 
is expected to focus on integrating a detailed battery lifetime model that 
captures the effects of degradation on the system’s performance and 
economic viability. This could involve using empirical data or physics- 
based models to predict the battery’s capacity fade and resistance in­
crease over time. By incorporating a more realistic battery degradation 
model, future studies can provide more accurate and reliable insights 
into the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of hybrid renewable energy 
systems for rural healthcare facilities. 
Despite these limitations and uncertainties, this study provides 
valuable insights into the feasibility and potential of hybrid renewable 
energy systems for rural healthcare facilities in sub-Saharan Africa. The 
results can serve as a basis for further detailed engineering design, pilot 
projects, and policy development to support the implementation of 
sustainable energy solutions in the healthcare sector. 
Results and discussion 
This section discusses the results of the techno-economic simulation 
of the proposed energy system for healthcare centers and the MCDM 
assessments for the various tracking systems. The simulation results for 
the Nigerian and South African cases are presented in Tables 1 and 2, 
respectively. The techno-economic details of the battery bank connected 
to the optimal energy systems are presented in Tables S2 and S3. 
Nigeria 
The techno-economic results of the viable energy systems for the 
seven tracking configurations for the Nigeria case study is presented in 
this section. 
No-tracking 
The optimal non-tracking energy system for the PHC in Lagos em­
ploys a 5 kW solar photovoltaic (PV) array as the primary power source, 
supplemented by a 10 kW fuel cell and a 10 kW inverter to power the 
system when solar power is unavailable. An electrolyzer with a power 
capacity of 10 kW, a rectifier with a power capacity of 7.5 kW, and a 
hydrogen tank, weighing 16 kg allow for the storage of the solar PV 
power as hydrogen, which may be utilized later in the fuel cell. The 
system’s lifetime net present cost amounted to $14,272, whereas the 
levelized cost of energy was $0.336/kWh. The photovoltaic (PV) array 
accounted for 90 % of the annual power production with a capacity 
factor of 15 %. The implementation of the tracking mechanisms to

enhance the capacity factor can significantly increase the energy pro­
duction of the photovoltaic systems. The fuel cell contributed 10 % of 
the power required to compensate for the periods when solar energy was 
inaccessible, however, functioned for more than 5,000 h annually. An 
analysis of the hydrogen tank storage level (Fig. 6) shows that hydrogen 
production peaked between the months of mid-May and early November 
when the wind speed and solar radiation are at their cumulative peaks. 
The capacity factor and efficiency of 50 % are acceptable. The annual 
un-met load was 24 kWh, whereas the excess power generation is ~ 
1,100 kWh. The surplus electricity can be utilized to enhance the elec­
trolyzer’s capacity for increased hydrogen fuel production and improved 
reliability. The system effectively handled the load by using 100 % 
renewable energy. Because it is a renewable power set-up, emissions are 
significantly minimized. The fuel cell alone emitted only ~ 2.47 kg/year 
of nitrogen oxides. 
Horizontal Axis, daily Adjustment 
The most economical configuration of the HADA system comprises a 
5 kW photovoltaic (PV) array, a 10 kW fuel cell, a 10 kW inverter, a 7.5 
kW rectifier, a 10 kW electrolyzer, and a 12 kg hydrogen tank. The 
system had a total net present cost of $14,612, a levelized cost of energy 
of $0.344/kWh, and an annual operating cost of $624. The photovoltaic 
(PV) array represented 46 % of the system’s expenditure, while the fuel 
cell constituted 44 %. The electricity production amounts to 7,556 kWh/ 
yr, with photovoltaic (PV) systems contributing 91 % and fuel cells for 
the remaining 9 %. The primary load consumed 3,320 kWh/yr, which 
accounted for 59 % of the total energy consumption. The electrolyzer 
consumes 2,342 kWh annually, representing 41 % of the total energy 
consumption. The monthly hydrogen tank storage level for the optimal 
energy system for the HADA configuration is presented in Fig. 7. 
The hydrogen level pattern for the HADA configuration also followed 
that without a tracking system, there is deficient production between the 
months of January and February, while the hydrogen level was highest 
between the months of May and December. Additionally, there was a 
surplus of 1,567 kWh/yr from renewable energy sources. The annual 
hydrogen output was 50 kg, while the consumption rate was 42.8 kg/yr. 
The hydrogen tank had a storage capacity of 1,047 h. The net CO2 
emissions were −0.438 kg/yr, indicating a negative value, and the 
annual emission of NOx was 2.48 kg.

An optimal configuration for the tracking of HAMA comprised a 5 
kW photovoltaic (PV) array, a 1 kW wind turbine, a 10 kW fuel cell, a 10 
kW battery bank, a 10 kW inverter, a 7.5 kW rectifier, a 10 kW elec­
trolyzer, a 28 kg hydrogen tank, and a load following (LF) dispatch 
strategy. The system had a total net present cost of $16,103. It also had a 
levelized energy cost of $0.380 per kilowatt-hour and an annual oper­
ating cost of $425. The photovoltaic (PV) array represented 42 % of the 
system’s overall cost, while the battery bank represented 40 %. The 
expenses that were related to the initial investment were 65 % of the 
system’s overall expenditures. The overall electricity production 
amounted to 6,255 kWh per year, with the photovoltaic (PV) systems 
contributing 95 %, wind power contributing 2 %, and fuel cells 
contributing 4 %. The renewable energy surplus was 1,000 kWh annu­
ally, while the primary load consumed 3,318 kWh annually, accounting 
for 69 % of the total consumption. The electrolyzer consumed 1,520 
kWh annually, accounting for 31 % of the total consumption. The tank 
had a storage capacity of more than 2,400 h, with hydrogen production 
at 33 kg per year and consumption at 13.9 kg per year. The monthly 
hydrogen tank storage level for the optimal energy system for the HAMA 
configuration showed low levels of hydrogen between the months of 
January and mid-March and high levels of storage between the months 
of mid-June and early December (Fig. 8). The battery connected to the 
HAMA system is projected to have a lifetime throughput of 9170 kWh 
during its 10-year lifespan, with an average annual energy output of 401 
kWh (Table S2). Other technical and economic features of the battery is 
given in Table S2. The net CO2 emissions were −0.142 kg/yr, indicating 
a reduction in the CO2 levels. Additionally, there were 0.806 kg/yr of 
NOx emissions.

Conversely, the electrolyzer consumed ~ 1,672 kWh annually, ac­
counting for 33 % of the overall production. The surplus of renewable 
energy amounted to 907 kWh/yr. The annual hydrogen output was 36 
kg, while the consumption was 19.2 kg. The tank had a storage capacity 
of over 2,443 h. The net CO2 emissions were −0.196 kg/yr, indicating a 
reduction in the CO2 levels. Additionally, there were 1.11 kg/yr of NOx 
emissions. The monthly hydrogen tank storage level for the optimal 
energy system for HAWA configuration indicated the fact that the tank 
was full between the months of Mid-June and mid-November, while it 
was at its lowest between the months of January and mid-March (Fig. 9). 
Similarly, the HAWA battery bank is projected to have a lifetime 
throughput of 9170 kWh during its expected 10-year lifespan but it is 
anticipated to achieve a throughput of 455 kWh annually. 
Two-Axis tracking 
The best system with TA tracking comprised a 5 kW PV array, a 10 
kW fuel cell, a 10 kW inverter, a 7.5 kW rectifier, a 10 kW electrolyzer, 
and a 3 kg hydrogen tank. The TNPC of this system was $15,113, with a 
levelized COE of $0.356 per kWh and an annual running cost of $614. 
The PV array represented 44 % of the whole system expenditure, 
whereas the fuel cell constituted 42 %; the system costs comprised 48 % 
of the capital costs. The total electricity production was 8,810 kWh/yr, 
with the PV systems contributing 92 % and fuel cells contributing 8 %. 
The primary load consumed 3,318 kWh/yr, which accounted for 63 % of 
the total consumption. The electrolyzer utilized 1,967 kWh each year, 
which accounted for 37 % of the total energy usage. The surplus of 
renewable energy amounted to 3,199 kWh/yr. According to Fig. 10, the 
annual production and consumption of hydrogen were 42 kg, while the 
tank offered a storage capacity of 262 h. The net CO2 emissions were 
−0.432 kg/yr, indicating a reduction in the CO2 levels. Additionally, 
there were 2.45 kg/yr of NOx emissions. 
Vertical Axis, Continuous Adjustment 
The components of the optimal energy system for the VACA tracking, 
include a 5 kW solar (PV) array, a 3 kW wind turbine, a 10 kW fuel cell, a 
10 kW battery bank, an inverter, a rectifier, an electrolyzer, a 28 kg 
hydrogen tank, and a program that followed the load. With an annual 
running cost of $447 and a levelized energy cost of $0.406 per kWh, the 
system has a total net present cost of $17,207. Of the system cost, 39 % 
was attributable to the PV array and 37 % to the battery bank. Sixty- 
seven percent of system costs were attributed to capital expenditures. 
Wind accounted for 5 %, fuel cells for 3 %, and photovoltaics (PV) for 92 
% of the total 6,907 kWh/yr. The AC primary load consumed 3,319 
kWh/yr (69 %), and 1,507 kWh/yr went to the electrolyzer (or 31 % of 
consumption). The renewable energy sources produced an excess of 
1,659 kWh/yr. The annual output of hydrogen was 32 kg, whereas the 
yearly consumption was 12.5 kg. The tank had a hydrogen storage au­
tonomy of more than 2,400 h. Renewable energy replacing fossil fuels, 
resulted in a net CO2 emissions reduction of −0.128 kg/yr and 0.726 kg/ 
yr of NOx emissions. The system successfully attained a 100 % renew­
able energy supply by generating more energy than what was needed at 
a levelized cost of $0.406/kWh during its projected lifespan. The PV 
array and battery bank were the primary contributors to the system’s 
overall expenses. Hydrogen production surpassed consumption, allow­
ing for extended storage. The hydrogen level in the tank attached to the 
optimal energy system indicated that its level peaked between the 
months of June and December (Fig. 11). The battery connected to the 
VACA system is projected to have a total energy output of 9170 kWh 
throughout its anticipated 10-year lifespan; annually, the expected 
throughput is 384 kWh.

South Africa 
The techno-economic results of the viable energy systems for the 
seven tracking configurations for the South Africa case study is pre­
sented in this section 
No-Tracking 
The optimal system without tracking consisted of a 5 kW photovol­
taic array, a 10 kW fuel cell, a 10 kW inverter, a 7.5 kW rectifier, a 10 kW 
electrolyzer, and a 16 kg hydrogen tank. With a COE of $0.336/kWh, the 
system had a total net present cost of $14,272 throughout its lifespan, 
while the operational cost is $626 per year. The fuel cell ($6,530) and PV 
array ($6,695) were the most significant contributors with regard to net 
present costs The PV array was responsible for 90 % of the system’s total 
electricity production, or 6,552 kWh annually; it had a 15 % capacity 
factor and a $0.0799/kWh levelized cost. The fuel cell provides 10 % of 
the electricity, which had a 50 % mean electrical efficiency and pro­
duced 711 kWh annually. This system’s monthly hydrogen tank storage 
level showed that the hydrogen level was at its maximum between the 
months of June and December (Fig. 13). The energy consumption was 
entirely sourced from renewable sources, resulting in an annual surplus 
of 1,136 kWh. However, there was a shortfall of 24.2 kWh in meeting the 
demand and a capacity shortage of 29.8 kWh. This showed that the 
system can handle the primary need of 3,323 kWh/year. The fuel cell’s 
annual hydrogen consumption of 42.6 kg was less than the hydrogen 
production of 53 kg. The hydrogen tank storage allowed 1,396 h of 
autonomy. Overall, emissions were minimal; nonetheless, 2.47 kg of 
nitrogen oxides were produced annually.

battery bank. The balance of the system, rectifier, and inverter were the 
other parts. With a levelized COE of $0.339/kWh, the net present cost 
came to $14,393. With $328 annually, the operating costs were less. The 
PV array and battery bank were the most significant contributors to 
capital expenses. The PV array supplied the entire electric load of 8,390 
kWh/year. The battery stored the excess PV production, delivering 675 
kWh of output per year to the load. The highest average production 
occurred in the month of October, while the lowest was observed in the 
month of June (Fig. 14). Most of the months in the year had a power 
production ranging between 1 to 1.5 kW, except for the period from the 
months of April to July, during which time, the power production fell 
below 1 kW.

kW solar PV array with 10 Vision 6FM200D batteries that could hold 24 
kWh of charge; a 10 kW inverter and a 7.5 kW rectifier were parts of the 
power circuits. At a levelized cost of $0.339 per kWh, this system design 
was estimated to have a total net present cost of $14,393 It would also 
cost $328 per year to run. With an average output of 0.71 kW and a 
capacity factor of 14.2 %, the PV array generated 6,229 kWh of energy 
per year. The effective nominal battery capacity was 14.4 kWh, allowing 
for 37.7 h of self-sufficiency. During a projected lifespan of 10 years, the 
batteries were estimated to produce a total energy output of 9,170 kW- 
hours. The system adequately served the energy demand, with an 
additional annual generation of 2,368 kWh. The solar photovoltaic (PV) 
penetration was 186 %, indicating that the amount of solar PV energy 
generated exceed the total energy demand by 86 %. Additionally, the 
renewable portion was 100 %, meaning that all energy produced was 
from renewable sources. 
Fig. 16. represents a year’s average monthly electric production for 
the HAWA with the lowest production occurring in the months of 
December and January, while the highest production occurred in the 
month of October. Production fluctuates throughout the year, growing

the months of April, May, and June, while the peak, at 1.432 kW was 
reached in the month of October with monthly averages ranging from 
0.6 to 1.432 kW (Fig. 19). 
Water consumption and implications of the electrolyzer 
An important aspect of the proposed hybrid renewable energy sys­
tem is the water consumption of the electrolyzer, which is used to store 
excess electricity as hydrogen. The electrolyzer in this study has a rated 
hydrogen production capacity of 10 kW. Based on the annual hydrogen 
production ranges presented in Table 1 and Table 2, the estimated 
annual water consumption of the electrolyzer can be calculated using 
the water consumption rate of 0.9 L/kWh, which is typical for polymer 
electrolyte membrane (PEM) electrolyzers [22]. 
For Nigeria, around 48.1 to 53.4 kg/year of hydrogen is produced, 
which is equal to 1,603 to 1,780 kWh/year (assuming a lower heating 
value of hydrogen of 33.33 kWh/kg [25]. This means that the electro­
lyzer in Nigeria would use approximately 1,440 to 1600 L of water per 
year. Similarly, in South Africa, the annual hydrogen production ranges 
from 45.3 to 53.3 kg/year (1,510 to 1,776 kWh/year), resulting in an 
estimated annual water consumption of 1,360 to 1600 L. While these 
water consumption estimates are low in comparison to the total amount 
of water used in healthcare institutions, it is critical to evaluate the 
water source and its consequences for the system’s sustainability and 
resilience. Given the healthcare institutions’ rural locations, it is assu­
med that the electrolyzer will use freshwater obtained from surroun­
ding boreholes or wells. If the water quality does not satisfy the 
electrolysis specifications, a simple filtration and purification device can 
be used to pre-treat the water [19]. 
However, in areas with limited freshwater resources, using seawater 
for electrolysis could be considered as another option. This would 
involve making important changes to the design of the electrolyzer, like 
using materials that can resist corrosion and implementing more 
advanced filtration and pretreatment systems. These modifications are 
likely to make the electrolyzer subsystem more expensive to build and 
maintain [30]. In the future, researchers could conduct studies to assess 
whether it’s practical and financially viable to use seawater for elec­
trolysis in hybrid renewable energy systems for rural healthcare facil­
ities. The water requirement for the electrolyzer may have a long-term 
implication regarding sustainability and resilience in the development 
of the proposed hybrid renewable system. On the other hand, the 
possible use of seawater has a corresponding potential in future works to 
optimize system design and economics, especially in areas that are water 
scarce. 
Multi-criterial-decision-making results 
This section presents the results of the MCDM analysis by using 
EDAS; as opposed to using the ideal or optimal answer; EDAS uses the 
average solution as a benchmark. As a result, it is less susceptible to 
extremes in the criteria values. The results of the EDAS method were 
validated by using the TOPSIS method; this was selected because of its 
ability to establish positive and negative ideal reference points, offering 
a valuable benchmark for comparison. 
The first step in implementing EDAS is to determine the initial de­
cision matrix. This matrix usually entails the determination of the al­
ternatives (in this case the best energy systems for each tracking system) 
and the criteria (obtained from the energy simulation results). This study 
selects the Total NPC, COE, LCOH, Capacity Shortage, Total Electrical 
Production, and Excess Electricity as criteria. These criteria cover factors 
that are related to economic and technical constraints. The alternative 
includes optimal systems for: NT, HADA, HAMA, HAWA, TA, VACA and 
HACA tracking configurations. Hence, the initial decision matric is 
given, as shown in Eq. (14).

Following the estimation of the positive and negative distances from 
the average, the alternatives’ weighted sums of PDA and NDA (SPi and 
SNi), are calculated by multiplying [PDAij]q×p and [NDAij]q×p with the 
weight of the criteria, denoted as wj by using Eqs. (22) and (23), 
respectively. The weight, wj is usually greater than 0 and does not 
exceed 1; in addition, the sum of the weights of the criteria must be equal 
to 1. The CRITIC method is used to calculate the criteria weights and for 
the CRITIC method, the weights obtained are from Eq. (23). For the 
Nigerian case study, excess electricity had the highest weight of 28.87 
%, while the criterion with the least weight was the levelized cost of 
hydrogen (Fig. 20). With regards to the South African case, the Total 
Electricity Production, and the Total NPC, had the highest and lowest 
contributions of 22.22 % and 12.74 %, respectively (Fig. 20).

The assessment score for each energy system alternative is obtained 
by using Eq. (31). The values of the assessment score were used to rank 
the alternatives. The results of the EDAS assessment for the South Af­
rican case study is presented in Table 3; these include the values for SPi,
SNi. NSPi, NSNi, and ASi. By using the assessment scores for both case 
studies, the most preferred energy technology for the Nigerian case 
study, is the one that used the non-tracking device, while the least 
preferred, is the energy system with a VACA technology (Fig. 21). For 
the South African case, the energy system HAMA tracking technology 
was the most preferred, while the energy system without a tracking 
system is the most preferred (Fig. 21).

Table 4 compares the results of this present and similar studies. 
Dekkiche et al., [20] reveal that Vertical Single-Axis Trackers are the 
most economically feasible, contrasting with [24]’s emphasis on 
improved energy harvest and reduced NPC with horizontal and dual 
trackers. Hosseini Dehshiri et al. highlighted the significant electricity 
generation increase with Two-Axis (TA) systems, contrasting with [12]’s 
regional optimization focus, which identified daily adjusted horizontal 
axis trackers as the best for Nigeria. However, Hosseini Dehshiri & Fir­
oozabadi, [24]’s result aligns with that obtained by Babatunde et al. 
which identified Dual Axis as optimal for the South African case. This 
present study shows that based on the techno-economic results, the 
optimal energy system for the Nigerian case is the energy arrangement 
without tracking devices, while the best system for the South African 
healthcare facility is the one with HAWA tracking. The findings 
emphasize the complex nature of HRES design, which is influenced by 
economic, technological, and regional factors. Efficient system design 
necessitates the harmonization of economic viability and energy pro­
duction capacity, employing appropriate monitoring configurations 
tailored to specific project objectives and geographical circumstances. 
By and large, this study’s findings present some novel results. First, 
the techno-economic analysis shows that the proposed hybrid renewable 
energy systems for rural healthcare institutions in Nigeria and South 
Africa are feasible and cost-effective. This agrees with the study carried 
out by Babatunde et al. for another application in both South Africa and 
Nigeria [11]. The optimal energy designs can supply electricity demands 
at competitive costs, with LCOEs ranging from $0.340–0.410/kWh in 
Nigeria and $0.336–0.354/kWh in South Africa. Furthermore, the 
analysis of various solar tracking arrangements reveals their impact on 
energy production, costs, and overall system viability, introducing a new 
viewpoint to evaluating hybrid systems for rural healthcare centers. The 
findings of this study have broader implications that extend beyond the 
specific case studies of rural healthcare facilities in Nigeria and South 
Africa. The methods and insights acquired can be utilized in other lo­
cations facing similar energy access and healthcare delivery challenges. 
The comprehensive techno-economic analysis, integration of various 
solar tracking configurations, and utilization of the EDAS approach for 
MCDM analysis provide a framework for assessing the viability and 
enhancing the design of hybrid renewable energy systems in other re­
gions. The system designs, which integrate solar PV, wind turbines, 
batteries, and hydrogen storage, can be adapted to suit different loca­
tions’ specific conditions and requirements. 
Conclusion 
Access to reliable and sustainable power in developing countries’ 
rural areas remains a major issue. This study examined the technical and 
economic performances of solar PV/wind/battery/fuel cell hybrid sys­
tems for off-grid primary healthcare clinics in Sub-Saharan Africa. The 
HOMER software was used to design and simulate optimal hybrid 
renewable energy systems for Nigeria and South Africa, as case studies. 
This study provides novel insights into the subject of hybrid renewable 
energy systems for rural healthcare facilities in sub-Saharan Africa. The 
comprehensive techno-economic analysis, assessment of solar tracking 
configurations, and utilization of the EDAS approach for MCDM analysis 
offer innovative perspectives on these systems’ viability, optimization, 
and decision-making procedures. The results emphasize the potential 
impact of hybrid renewable energy systems on bridging the gap between 
energy access and healthcare delivery in rural areas, while also sup­
porting the global initiatives to accomplish Sustainable Development 
Goals 3 and 7 and reduce the effects of climate change. 
The findings demonstrate the practicality of supplying energy to 
rural clinics by using solar photovoltaic (PV) systems, wind power, 
batteries, and hydrogen storage. The hybrid systems developed, can 
efficiently meet the electrical demands of health the facilities in Nigeria 
and South Africa, with levelized energy costs ranging from 
$0.340–0.410/kWh and $0.336–0.354/kWh, respectively. The pro­
posed hybrid systems can provide reliable power, facilitating healthcare 
service delivery and enhancing quality of life. This aligns with the 
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 3 and 7. 
The hybrid systems leverage abundant local solar and wind re­
sources, aligning with SDG 7′s call for sustainable energy access. 
Nigeria’s annual power production ranges from 6,255 to 8,810 kWh, 
while South Africa’s ranges from 5,963 to 10,470 kWh. Solar photo­
voltaic (PV) technology accounts for over 90 % of this energy produc­
tion. The research provides an effective framework for context-specific 
planning and adopting renewable hybrids for off-grid health facilities. 
Although greater proportions of renewable energy sources lead to a 
decrease in the cost of electricity (COE) and emissions, they also 
significantly increase the initial investment required. To make hybrid 
systems more affordable, governments should institute policies that can 
be of help, such as: subsidies, incentives, and financing schemes to the 
operators of the hybrid systems. Positive signs for increasing electrifi­
cation in the rural areas include a declining COE trend due to an increase 
in the incorporation of renewable energy sources. A decrease in COE 
enhances the availability of power and drives socioeconomic develop­
ment in outlying regions. 
The proposed hybrid energy system can mitigate the associated 
environmental concerns by replacing diesel generators. The emissions

decrease by between 90–100 %, with yearly NOx emissions ranging 
between 0.726–2.48 kg in Nigeria and 0 kg in South Africa. The NOx 
emission results from the air intake of contaminants, anode reactions, 
catalyst activity, operating conditions, and fuel impurities. The study 
demonstrates the feasibility of solar PV/wind/battery systems in deliv­
ering sustainable and reliable energy access to enhance healthcare, 
therefore, promoting the achievement of Sustainable Development 
Goals 3 and 7. 
This research has proven that it is feasible to power healthcare fa­
cilities in Sub-Saharan Africa with sustainable and efficiently designed 
hybrid renewable systems. By employing efficient system design, PV/ 
wind/battery hybrids offer a practical alternative for extending power 
supply to facilitate healthcare service delivery, therefore, effectively 
addressing the issue of intermittent electricity supplies in the primary 
health sectors in Sub-Saharan Africa. The study provides a significant 
framework that can adequately assist in the planning of tailored to the 
specific circumstances of un-electrified rural communities in the region, 
with the desire to attain the aims of the Sustainable Development Goals 
3 and 7.

This paper  presents
 the results  of  a revealed-choice
 experiment
 testing
 the  theoretical
predictions
 of  a model
 of  a mixed
 system
 of
 public
 and  private
 ﬁnance.
 We  investigate
behavioural
 responses
 in  individuals’
 willingnesses-to-pay
 for  private
 health  insurance
to
 changes
 in  the public  sector  allocation
 rule  (needs-based
 vs.  random),
 the supply
 of
health
 care  resources,
 and  the  size  of
 the  public
 health
 care
 budget.
 Of  particular
 interest
is
 how  willingness-to-pay
 for  private
 insurance
 feeds  back  into
 the  determination
 of  the
equilibrium
 price  of
 health  care  resources,
 the  probability
 of  public
 treatment
 and  which
individuals
 are  left  untreated.
 Our  ﬁndings
 are  generally
 consistent
 with  the  predictions
of
 the  theoretical
 model,
 although
 individuals
 consistently
 exhibit
 greater
 willingnesses-
to-pay
 for  private
 insurance
 than  predicted
 resulting
 in  a larger  than  predicted
 amount
 of
private
 insurance
 being  purchased.
 A
 commonly
 used
 risk-aversion
 measure
 only
 partially
explains
 this  observed
 deviation.
 We  also  ﬁnd  that,  relative
 to  a system
 of public
 ﬁnancing
only,
 a mixed  system
 of  health  care  ﬁnance
 results  in  higher
 health  care  prices
 and  sicker,
poorer
 people
 being  left  untreated.

 Introduction
Worldwide
 debate
 rages
 on
 over
 the
 role
 of
 public
 and
 private
 ﬁnance
 in
 the
 provision
 of
 private
 goods,
 and
 in
 no
 area
more
 so
 than
 health
 care.
 The
 presence
 and
 extent
 of
 supplementary
 (or
 parallel)
 private
 insurance
 in
 mixed
 systems
 of
ﬁnance
 is
 a
 source
 of
 considerable
 policy
 controversy
 in
 many
 public
 health
 care
 systems.
 Many
 governments
 (e.g.,
 UK)
have
 reduced
 or
 eliminated
 public
 subsidies
 to
 private
 insurance,
 while
 others
 (e.g.,
 Australia,
 Portugal)
 continue
 to
 publicly
subsidize
 individuals’
 purchases
 of
 private
 insurance,
 in
 part
 based
 on
 the
 belief
 that
 private
 insurance
 will
 reduce
 pressure
on
 the
 public
 system
 (Mossialos
 and
 Thomson,
 2004).
 In
 Canada,
 the
 Supreme
 Court
 struck
 down
 a
 law
 in
 the
 province
 of
Quebec
 prohibiting
 the
 provision
 of
 parallel
 private
 insurance,
 citing
 in
 its
 argument
 the
 lack
 of
 evidence
 that
 such
 insurance
harms
 the
 performance
 of
 the
 public
 system
 (Flood
 et
 al.,
 2005).

 impact
 of
 supplementary
 private
 insurance
 on

system
 outcomes
 depends
 on
 the
 complex
 interaction
 of
 both
 demand
 and
 supply-side
 factors
 in
 both
 the
 insurance
 and
health
 care
 service
 markets.1
The
 demand
 for
 supplementary
 private
 insurance
 has
 been
 a
 focus
 of
 analysis
 because
 of
 its
 importance
 for
 understanding
the
 dynamics
 of
 mixed
 systems
 of
 ﬁnance.
 Demand
 analyses
 have
 focused
 particular
 attention
 on
 the
 role
 of
 public
 sector
wait
 times
 in
 driving
 demand
 for
 supplementary
 private
 insurance,
 both
 because
 the
 costs
 of
 long
 waits
 suggest
 that
 they
should
 matter
 (e.g.,
 Johannesson
 et
 al.,
 1988)
 and
 because
 survey
 data
 suggest
 that
 they
 do
 matter
 (e.g.,
 Harmon
 and
 Nolan,
2001).
 Demand
 analyses
 that
 examine
 the
 impact
 of
 area-level
 wait
 lists
 on
 individual
 demand
 for
 supplementary
 private
insurances
 have
 found
 a
 positive
 relationship
 (e.g.,
 Besley
 et
 al.,
 1999;
 Jofre-Bonet,
 2000).
 More
 recently,
 using
 micro-data
 and
imputed
 individual-speciﬁc
 estimates
 of
 both
 expected
 wait
 time
 and
 the
 probability
 of
 experiencing
 a
 long
 wait,
 Johar
 et
 al.
(2011)
 found
 that
 the
 probability
 of
 experiencing
 a
 long
 wait
 seemed
 particularly
 important
 in
 driving
 demand
 for
 a
 subset
of
 the
 population.
 Concomitant
 with
 the
 question
 of
 how
 access
 to
 publicly
 ﬁnanced
 care
 affects
 demand
 for
 supplementary
private
 insurance
 has
 been
 the
 important
 question
 of
 how
 the
 size
 of
 the
 supplementary
 private
 insurance
 sector
 affects
outcomes
 in
 the
 public
 system,
 including
 wait
 times,
 quality,
 and
 costs.
 Evidence
 on
 this
 question
 is
 limited
 and
 equivocal
(again,
 see
 reviews
 in
 Propper
 and
 Green,
 2001;
 Tuohy
 et
 al.,
 2004).
 The
 recent
 experience
 in
 Australia
 following
 the
 dramatic
expansion
 of
 the
 supplementary
 private
 insurance
 sector
 (in
 response
 to
 government
 incentives)
 indicates
 that
 the
 private
insurance
 sector
 had
 little
 or
 no
 impact
 on
 wait
 times
 in
 the
 public
 system
 or
 on
 restraining
 expenditures
 in
 the
 public
system
 (Hopkins
 and
 Zweifel,
 2005).
 However,
 many
 Australian
 studies,
 like
 much
 of
 the
 literature
 more
 generally,
 suffer
from
 poor
 quality
 data
 on
 key
 outcomes
 (like
 wait
 times)
 and
 weak
 research
 designs.
This
 paper
 contributes
 to
 the
 literature
 on
 mixed
 systems
 of
 ﬁnance
 by
 using
 experimental
 economic
 methods
 to
 study
the
 demand
 for
 private
 supplementary
 insurance
 and
 how
 the
 public
 and
 private
 sectors
 interact
 to
 determine
 access
 to
 care
through
 both
 the
 public
 and
 private
 sectors.
 Speciﬁcally,
 we
 test
 the
 theoretical
 predictions
 of
 the
 Cuff
 et
 al.
 (2012)
 model
of
 mixed
 public
 and
 private
 ﬁnance
 under
 different
 public
 health
 care
 rationing
 rules.
 Cuff
 et
 al.
 predict
 that
 an
 individual’s
willingness-to-pay
 (WTP)
 for
 private
 supplementary
 insurance
 that
 guarantees
 access
 to
 needed
 health
 care
 should
 depend
in
 part
 on
 the
 individual’s
 perceived
 access
 to
 health
 care
 in
 the
 public
 system,
 which
 in
 turn
 depends
 on
 the
 public
 allocation
rule.
 Hence,
 the
 size
 of
 a
 privately
 ﬁnanced
 health
 care
 system
 will
 depend
 critically
 on
 how
 public
 health
 care
 resources
are
 allocated.
This
 paper
 uses
 a
 novel
 incentivized
 revealed-choice
 experiment
 to
 investigate
 behavioural
 responses
 to
 the
 introduction
of
 private
 insurance
 in
 parallel
 to
 an
 existing
 public
 health
 insurance
 system.
 The
 use
 of
 a
 revealed-choice
 experiment
 allows
us
 to
 address
 a
 design
 weakness
 inherent
 to
 observational
 studies
 because
 it
 allows
 for
 the
 isolation
 of
 several
 exogenous
channels
 that
 can
 independently
 be
 activated
 or
 modiﬁed
 in
 order
 to
 trace
 their
 impacts
 on
 individual
 behaviour
 and
implications
 for
 system
 outcomes.
 Within
 the
 experiment,
 the
 public
 and
 private
 insurance
 sectors
 interact
 to
 determine
 the
size
 of
 the
 private
 insurance
 sector,
 the
 probability
 of
 treatment
 in
 the
 public
 system,
 and
 the
 severities
 and
 incomes
 of
 those
treated
 in
 each
 sector.
 We  describe
 the
 environment
 in
 detail
 below.
 The
 choices
 of
 a
 population
 of
 income-differentiated
subjects
 endogenously
 determine
 outcomes
 in
 the
 parallel
 public
 and
 private
 health
 insurance
 markets
 in
 a
 setting
 in
 which
the
 supply
 of
 health
 care
 resources
 is
 insufﬁcient
 to
 treat
 all
 members
 of
 society.
 In
 addition,
 the
 government
 is
 constrained
by
 its
 budget,
 which
 limits
 its
 ability
 to
 purchase
 resources
 to
 treat
 those
 seeking
 care
 in
 the
 public
 system.
 As
 a
 consequence,
the
 public
 system
 must
 ration
 access
 to
 care
 in
 the
 public
 system.
 How
 the
 public
 system
 rations
 care
 and
 the
 likelihood
of
 receiving
 care
 in
 the
 public
 system
 affects
 the
 WTP
 for
 private
 insurance,
 which
 in
 turn
 endogenously
 determines
 the
price
 of
 the
 health
 care
 resource
 and
 the
 number
 of
 individuals
 treated
 privately.
 We  are
 particularly
 interested
 in
 how
 the
market
 price
 of
 health
 care
 resources
 and
 care-seeking
 between
 the
 public
 and
 private
 systems
 are
 affected
 by
 changes
 in:
(i)
 the
 public
 health
 care
 sector
 allocation
 rule
 (needs-based
 versus
 random),
 (ii)
 the
 total
 quantity
 (supply)
 of
 health
 care
resources
 in
 the
 economy,
 and
 (iii)
 the
 public
 health
 care
 budget.2
The
 paper
 also
 makes
 a
 methodological
 contribution.
 Although
 health
 economists
 commonly
 use
 stated-preference
experiments,
 including
 discrete
 choice
 experiments
 and
 contingent
 valuations
 to
 elicit
 willingness-to-pay
 of
 individuals
for
 private
 insurance
 (San
 Miguel
 et
 al.,
 2002;
 Ryan
 et
 al.,
 2008;
 Louviere
 and
 Lancsar,
 2009),
 they
 have
 seldom
 used
 incen-
tivized
 revealed-preference
 experiments.3 This
 is
 surprising
 given
 that
 controlled
 laboratory
 experiments
 have
 been
 used
 in
other
 ﬁelds
 of
 economics,
 most
 notably
 for
 the
 evaluation
 of
 alternative
 market
 pricing
 mechanisms
 and
 for
 the
 evaluation
 of
market-based
 environmental
 policies
 such
 as
 emission
 trading
 permits
 (Cason
 and
 Plott,
 1996).
 The
 laboratory
 methodology
is
 useful
 to
 evaluate
 theories
 of
 behaviour
 as
 well
 as
 to
 investigate
 the
 effects
 of
 alternative
 policy
 designs
 prior
 to
 their
 imple-
mentation.
 As
 such,
 they
 have
 considerable
 potential
 for
 identifying
 the
 impact
 of
 alternative
 institutional
 arrangements
 on
health
 system
 outcomes
 and
 for
 informing
 our
 understanding
 of
 a
 number
 of
 important
 questions
 in
 health
 economics.
 It
is
 not
 the
 goal
 of
 experiments
 to
 re-create
 the
 full
 complexity
 of
 the
 naturally
 occurring
 environment.
 Rather,
 laboratory
1 Propper
 and
 Green
 (2001)
 and
 Tuohy
 et
 al.
 (2004)
 summarize
 various
 arguments
 regarding
 the
 impact
 of
 supplementary
 private
 insurance
 and
 review
relevant
 empirical
 evidence.
2 As
 discussed
 below,
 to
 maximize
 the
 external
 validity
 of
 our
 laboratory
 experiment
 to
 the
 ﬁeld,
 we  use
 a
 market
 trading
 institution
 based
 on
 the
 sealed

 Theoretical
 model
Cuff
 et
 al.
 (2012)
 model
 the
 determination
 of
 the
 health
 care
 market
 equilibrium
 with
 parallel
 public
 and
 private
 health
care
 ﬁnance
 involving
 a
 population
 of
 N
 individuals
 that
 differ
 continuously
 along
 two
 dimensions:
 income
 (Y)
 and
 severity
of
 illness
 (s).
 Incomes
 are
 distributed
 in
 the
 population
 over
 the
 interval
 [Ymin,
 Ymax]
 according
 to
 the
 cumulative
 distribution
G(Y)
 and
 severity
 is
 distributed
 in
 the
 population
 over
 the
 unit
 interval
 according
 to
 the
 cumulative
 distribution
 F(s).4 Both
the
 distributions
 and
 support
 of
 income
 and
 severity
 are
 known
 by
 everyone
 and
 the
 size
 of
 the
 population
 is
 normalized
to
 one.
All
 individuals
 in
 the
 population
 become
 ill.
 Illness
 affects
 an
 individual’s
 health
 status
 and
 ability
 to
 work
 and,
 conse-
quently,
 income.
 Denoting
 full
 health
 as
 h,
 the
 more
 severe
 the
 illness
 the
 greater
 is
 the
 health
 loss.
 The
 non-monetary
 health
loss
 of
 illness
 depends
 only
 on
 severity,
 is
 the
 same
 for
 all
 individuals
 with
 the
 same
 severity
 and
 is
 independent
 of
 income.
The
 more
 severe
 the
 illness,
 however,
 the
 greater
 is
 the
 amount
 of
 time
 the
 individual
 is
 unable
 to
 work
 and
 the
 greater
 is
the
 individual’s
 income
 loss.
 The
 income
 loss
 is
 assumed
 to
 be
 proportional
 to
 the
 individual’s
 severity;
 that
 is,
 if
 not
 treated,
the
 income
 loss
 is
 equal
 to
 sY.
 An
 individual’s
 utility
 is
 separable
 in
 income
 and
 health
 status
 and
 thus,
 the
 expected
 utility
 of
an
 individual
 with
 income
 Y
 and
 an
 illness
 severity
 of
 s
 is 
[u((1
 −
 s)Y)
 +
 v((1
 −
 s)h)]dF,
 where
 u
 is
 the
 sub-utility
 of
 income
function
 and
 v
 is
 the
 sub-utility
 of
 health
 status.
A
 health
 care
 treatment
 is
 available,
 however,
 that
 can
 cure
 an
 individual’s
 illness
 immediately
 and
 completely
 (regardless
of
 severity
 level).
 An
 individual
 who
 receives
 treatment
 suffers
 no
 income
 or
 health
 loss.
 While
 all
 individuals
 in
 society
would
 like
 to
 be
 treated,
 the
 supply
 of
 the
 health
 care
 resource
 (H)
 used
 to
 produce
 the
 health
 care
 treatment
 is
 ﬁxed
 and
insufﬁcient
 to
 treat
 all
 individuals
 in
 society.
Treatment
 can
 be
 obtained
 through
 either
 the
 public
 insurer
 or
 a
 private
 insurer.
 There
 is
 no
 difference
 in
 the
 quality
of
 health
 care
 services
 provided
 by
 the
 public
 and
 private
 insurers:
 health
 outcomes
 are
 identical
 and
 treatment
 in
 both
requires
 one
 unit
 of
 the
 health
 care
 resource
 to
 produce
 one
 unit
 of
 health
 care.
 The
 market
 for
 the
 health
 care
 resource
is
 competitive.
 The
 public
 insurer
 and
 the
 private
 insurers
 both
 contract
 with
 suppliers
 of
 health
 care
 resources
 to
 provide
treatment
 to
 the
 insurers’
 respective
 beneﬁciaries.
 The
 public
 insurer
 bids
 for
 health
 care
 resources
 according
 to
 its
 ability-
to-pay,
 as
 determined
 by
 the
 public
 health
 care
 budget.
 Private
 insurers
 bid
 for
 health
 care
 resources
 according
 to
 their
willingnesses-to-pay,
 which
 are
 based
 on
 individuals’
 willingnesses-to-pay
 for
 private
 insurance
 that
 guarantees
 access
to
 care
 regardless
 of
 severity
 level.5 The
 public
 and
 private
 sectors
 compete
 directly
 for
 the
 limited
 supply
 of
 health
 care
resource
 and
 there
 is
 a
 market-clearing
 equilibrium
 price
 (P)
 for
 the
 health
 care
 resource
 at
 which
 all
 of
 the
 health
 care
resource
 is
 allocated
 to
 insurers
 and,
 thereby,
 to
 the
 population.
2.1.
 Public
 health
 care
 ﬁnancing
 only
As
 a
 benchmark,
 consider
 ﬁrst
 a
 system
 of
 health
 care
 ﬁnancing
 with
 only
 a
 public
 insurer.
 Given
 the
 limited
 supply
 of
the
 health
 care
 resource,
 the
 public
 insurer
 must
 ration
 access
 to
 publicly
 insured
 services.
 Cuff
 et
 al.
 (2012)
 consider
 two
different
 public
 allocation
 rules:
 needs-based
 allocation
 and
 random
 allocation.
Under
 the
 needs-based
 allocation
 rule,
 the
 public
 insurer
 rations
 health
 care
 according
 to
 need
 (deﬁned
 by
 severity
 of
illness),
 treating
 the
 most
 severe
 cases
 ﬁrst.
 Allocation
 according
 to
 need
 is
 the
 stated
 objective
 of
 many
 publicly
 ﬁnanced
health
 care
 systems
 (van
 Doorslaer
 et
 al.,
 1993),
 including
 Canada’s
 (Marchildon,
 2005).
 Such
 systems
 use
 a
 number
 of
devices
 in
 an
 attempt
 to
 allocate
 services
 according
 to
 need,
 including
 for
 example,
 General
 Practitioner
 (GP)
 gatekeepers
who
 control
 access
 to
 specialist
 care,
 diagnostic
 services,
 prescription
 drugs
 and
 other
 services
 based
 on
 the
 nature
 and
severity
 of
 the
 patient’s
 condition.
 Specialists
 can
 analogously
 ration
 access
 to
 advanced
 procedures
 on
 the
 basis
 of
 patient
need.
Under
 the
 random
 allocation
 rule,
 the
 public
 insurer
 rations
 health
 care
 randomly
 so
 that
 the
 probability
 of
 treatment
by
 the
 public
 insurer
 is
 independent
 of
 severity.
 No
 system
 deliberately
 rations
 randomly,
 but
 because
 of
 informational
 and
4 Income
 and
 severity
 are
 assumed
 independently
 distributed,
 but
 the
 results
 are
 robust
 to
 allowing
 for
 a
 negative
 correlation
 between
 income
 and
severity
 (Cuff
 et
 al.,
 2012).
5 Private
 insurers
 charge
 a
 single
 price
 for
 health
 insurance
 equal
 to
 the
 market-clearing
 price.
 In
 this
 sense,
 the
 private
 health
 insurance
 contracts
 are
actuarially
 fair
 in
 aggregate
 since
 the
 private
 insurers
 earn
 zero
 proﬁt;
 but
 at
 the
 individual
 level,
 price
 does
 not
 necessarily
 equal
 a
 person’s
 expected
 loss
of
 not
 being
 treated.

 problems,
 some
 randomness
 of
 access
 can
 arise
 even
 in
 systems
 that
 strive
 to
 allocate
 health
 care
 according
to
 need.6 Random
 allocation,
 in
 a
 sense,
 represents
 a
 lower
 bound
 of
 other
 forms
 of
 allocation
 mechanisms
 that
 use
 some
(possibly
 imperfect)
 information
 about
 individuals,
 including
 information
 on
 their
 need
 for
 health
 care
 (Wijkander,
 1988).
In
 reality,
 allocation
 is
 likely
 a
 mixture
 of
 these
 two
 extreme
 rules
 –
 needs-based
 allocation
 and
 random
 allocation
 –
 where
the
 weight
 given
 to
 each
 depends
 on
 the
 emphasis
 placed
 on
 need
 and
 the
 speciﬁc
 institutional
 arrangements
 of
 the
 public
health
 care
 system.
The
 public
 insurer
 has
 an
 exogenously
 determined
 ﬁscal
 budget,
 denoted
 by
 B,
 that
 is
 independent
 of
 the
 public
 allocation
rule.
 The
 public
 insurer
 would
 like
 to
 treat
 as
 many
 people
 as
 possible.
 Denote
 M
 as
 the
 number
 treated
 by
 the
 public
 sector.
The
 public
 insurer’s
 ability-to-pay
 per
 treatment
 is
 given
 by
 B/M.
 Since
 the
 public
 insurer
 is
 the
 only
 demander
 of
 health
care
 resources,
 M
 =
 H
 and
 the
 equilibrium
 price
 per
 unit
 of
 resource
 that
 clears
 the
 health
 care
 resource
 market
 is
 PO =
 B/H.
Any
 increase
 in
 the
 public
 insurer’s
 budget
 or
 decrease
 in
 the
 supply
 of
 health
 care
 resources
 will
 increase
 the
 market
 price
for
 the
 health
 care
 resource.
 The
 public
 insurer
 purchases
 all
 available
 health
 care
 resources,
 so
 H
 individuals
 are
 treated
and
 1
 −
 H
 individuals
 remain
 untreated,
 regardless
 of
 the
 size
 of
 the
 public
 insurer’s
 budget.
Who
 receives
 treatment
 from
 the
 public
 insurer
 depends
 on
 how
 the
 public
 insurer
 rations
 health
 care.
 Under
 random
allocation,
 the
 proportion
 of
 individuals
 treated
 (or,
 the
 probability
 of
 treatment)
 is
 given
 by
 H,
 and
 the
 expected
 severity
 level
of
 those
 treated
 (and
 of
 those
 untreated)
 is
 simply
 the
 unconditional
 expected
 severity
 level,
 E(s).
 Under
 needs-based
 alloca-
tion,
 the
 public
 insurer
 speciﬁes
 a
 severity
 threshold
 sO such
 that
 all
 individuals
 with
 severity
 above
 this
 severity
 threshold
 are
treated
 and
 all
 those
 with
 severity
 less
 than
 this
 threshold
 are
 not
 treated.
 The
 severity
 threshold
 is
 given
 by
 sO =
 F−1(1
 −
 H).
The
 expected
 severity
 conditional
 on
 being
 treated
 is
 equal
 to
 E(s|s
 >
 sO).
 Since
 the
 public
 sector
 targets
 resources
 at
 high
severity
 patients,
 the
 expected
 severity
 of
 the
 treated
 under
 needs-based
 allocation
 is
 greater
 than
 the
 unconditional
 mean,
E(s).
 Under
 either
 public
 rationing
 rule,
 the
 likelihood
 of
 treatment
 in
 a
 pure
 public
 system
 is
 independent
 of
 income.
2.2.
 Mixed
 public
 and
 private
 health
 care
 ﬁnancing
Now
 suppose
 that
 supplemental
 private
 insurance
 is
 introduced,
 so
 individuals
 can
 purchase
 private
 insurance
 that
guarantees
 them
 access
 to
 health
 care
 treatments
 regardless
 of
 a
 person’s
 realized
 severity
 level.7 Individuals
 do
 not
 know
their
 severity
 level
 when
 they
 decide
 whether
 to
 purchase
 private
 insurance
 and
 are
 assumed
 to
 maximize
 their
 expected
utility
 when
 deciding
 whether
 to
 purchase
 private
 insurance.
 Without
 loss
 of
 generality,
 we
 assume
 that
 the
 marginal
 utility
of
 income
 is
 unity
 and
 suppress
 the
 part
 of
 utility
 arising
 from
 the
 individual’s
 health
 status.8 An
 individual
 who
 purchases
private
 insurance
 pays
 a
 premium,
 P,
 in
 return
 for
 guaranteed
 treatment
 regardless
 of
 severity,
 resulting
 in
 a
 utility
 of
Y
 −
 P.9 In
 contrast,
 an
 individual
 who
 relies
 on
 the
 public
 insurer
 and
 does
 not
 purchase
 private
 insurance
 has
 an
 expected
utility
 of
 Y
 +
 (1
 −
 )[1
 –
 E(s|no
 public
 care)]Y,
 where
 
 is
 the
 probability
 of
 receiving
 public
 health
 care
 and
 E(s|no
 public
care)
 is
 the
 individual’s
 expected
 severity
 conditional
 on
 not
 being
 treated
 publicly.
 Hence,
 [1
 −E(s|no
 public
 care)]Y
 is
 the
individual’s
 expected
 income
 if
 they
 do
 not
 receive
 public
 health
 care.10 An
 individual’s
 maximum
 willingness-to-pay
 for
private
 insurance
 is
 the
 amount
 of
 money
 that
 equates
 expected
 utility
 without
 private
 insurance
 to
 utility
 with
 private
insurance:
WTP
 =
 (1
 −
 )E(s|no
 public
 care)Y
An
 individual’s
 WTP
 for
 private
 insurance
 is
 decreasing
 in
 the
 probability
 of
 being
 treated
 publicly
 and
 increasing
 in
 the
expected
 income
 loss
 from
 not
 being
 treated
 by
 the
 public
 insurer.
 Both
 these
 factors
 depend
 on
 how
 the
 public
 insurer
allocates
 its
 health
 care
 resources.
Under
 random
 allocation,
 the
 expected
 severity
 of
 those
 who
 do
 not
 receive
 public
 treatment
 is
 simply
 the
 uncon-
ditional
 expected
 severity
 level
 E(s).
 Therefore,
 under
 a
 random
 allocation
 rule,
 the
 WTP
 of
 an
 individual
 with
 income
 Y
is
 WTPR =
 (1
 −
 R)E(s)Y,
 where
 “R”
 denotes
 random
 allocation.
 Under
 needs-based
 allocation,
 only
 individuals
 with
 severity
above
 a
 speciﬁed
 severity
 threshold,
 denoted
 by
 sN,
 receive
 public
 treatment
 and
 the
 probability
 of
 receiving
 public
 treatment
6 A
 recent
 survey
 of
 MRI
 clinics
 in
 Canada,
 for
 example,
 found
 that
 few
 sites
 had
 documented
 criteria

 decisions
 and
 most
 had
 limited

 entirely
 possible
 that
 patients
 with
 the
 same
 medical
indication
 for
 an
 MRI
 examination,
 at
 the
 same
 centre,
 could
 be
 placed
 in
 different
 prioritization
 categories,
 with
 very
 different
 wait
 times”
 (Emery
 et
 al.,
2009,
 p.
 82).
7 Purchasing
 private
 insurance
 in
 the
 model
 can
 be
 interpreted
 as
 shortening
 treatment
 wait
 time
 as
 only
 a
 portion
 of
 patients
 relying
 on
 the
 public
system
 will
 be
 treated
 in
 any
 given
 period,
 while
 all
 purchasers
 of
 private
 insurance
 are
 guaranteed
 to
 be
 treated
 within
 the
 period.
 This
 is
 consistent
with
 the
 empirical
 evidence
 that
 private
 health
 insurance
 policyholders
 experience
 shorter
 wait
 times
 for
 both
 elective
 treatments
 and
 acute
 hospital
 care
(Schwierz
 et
 al.,
 2011;
 Lungen
 et
 al.,
 2008).
8 Assuming
 a
 linear
 utility
 of
 income
 function
 simpliﬁes
 the
 analytics
 of
 the
 model
 and
 the
 qualitative
 results
 hold
 even
 with
 a
 strictly
 concave
 utility
of
 income
 function
 (Cuff
 et
 al.,
 2012).
 We focus
 exclusively
 on
 the
 income
 costs
 of
 not
 being
 treated
 because
 in
 a
 laboratory
 environment
 it
 is
 difﬁcult
 to
manipulate
 health
 status
 directly
 without
 violating
 human
 ethics
 guidelines.
9 As
 described
 earlier,
 private
 insurers
 bid
 according
 to
 individuals’
 willingnesses-to-pay
 and
 the
 public
 insurer
 bids
 according
 to
 its
 ability
 to
 pay.
 At
the
 market-clearing
 price
 P,
 the
 H
 health
 care
 resources
 are
 allocated
 to
 the
 population.
10 In
 Cuff
 et
 al.
 (2012),
 individuals
 form
 expectations
 over
 the
 probability
 of
 treatment
 by
 the
 public
 insurer
 and
 these
 expectations
 are
 conﬁrmed
 in
equilibrium.
 Alternatively,
 one
 can
 think
 of
 individuals
 taking
 the
 probability
 of
 treatment
 as
 given
 and
 this
 probability
 being
 determined
 in
 equilibrium.
We
 adopt
 the
 latter
 approach
 here.

is
 N =
 1
 −
 F(sN),
 where
 “N”
 denotes
 needs-based
 allocation.
 The
 expected
 income
 loss
 from
 not
 being
 treated
 is
 E(s|s
 <
 sN).
Therefore,
 under
 a
 needs-based
 allocation
 rule,
 the
 WTP
 of
 an
 individual
 with
 income
 Y
 is
 WTPN =
 (1
 –
 N)E(s|s
 <
 sN)Y.
An
 individual’s
 WTP
 is
 always
 increasing
 in
 income
 regardless
 of
 allocation
 rule.
 Therefore,
 if
 the
 price
 of
 private
 insurance
(or,
 equivalently
 the
 price
 of
 a
 unit
 of
 health
 care
 resource)
 is
 P,
 then
 all
 individuals
 with
 WTP
 greater
 than
 P
 will
 purchase
private
 insurance
 and
 all
 individuals
 with
 WTP
 less
 than
 P
 will
 not.
 Further,
 under
 either
 allocation
 rule,
 a
 reduction
 in
 the
probability
 of
 public
 treatment
 will
 increase
 an
 individual’s
 WTP
 for
 private
 insurance
 and
 therefore
 increase
 the
 demand
for
 private
 insurance.11
Both
 the
 price
 of
 the
 health
 care
 resource
 and
 the
 probability
 of
 treatment
 in
 the
 public
 system
 are
 determined
 in
equilibrium.
 The
 two
 equilibrium
 conditions
 are:
 (i)
 the
 health
 care
 resource
 market
 clears
 and
 (ii)
 the
 available
 health
 care
resources
 in
 the
 public
 system
 meet
 the
 rationed
 demand
 in
 the
 public
 system.
 Cuff
 et
 al.
 (2012)
 show
 that
 the
 equilibrium
price
 of
 health
 care
 is
 higher,
 the
 equilibrium
 probability
 of
 treatment
 in
 the
 public
 health
 care
 system
 is
 lower,
 and
 the
equilibrium
 number
 of
 individuals
 who
 purchase
 private
 insurance
 is
 greater
 when
 the
 public
 insurer
 rations
 by
 random
allocation
 than
 when
 it
 rations
 by
 need.
 This
 follows
 because,
 for
 a
 given
 probability
 of
 treatment
 by
 the
 public
 insurer,
the
 individuals’
 willingnesses-to-pay
 for
 private
 insurance
 are
 higher
 under
 random
 allocation
 than
 under
 needs-based
allocation.
 Consequently,
 the
 demand
 for
 the
 health
 care
 resource
 via
 private
 insurance
 is
 greater
 under
 random
 allocation,
causing
 the
 equilibrium
 price
 of
 health
 care
 to
 be
 higher.
 Given
 the
 higher
 price,
 the
 public
 insurer
 can
 afford
 to
 purchase
less
 of
 the
 health
 care
 resource,
 lowering
 the
 probability
 of
 treatment
 in
 the
 public
 system.
 Thus,
 the
 market
 outcome
 under
a
 parallel
 system
 of
 health
 care
 ﬁnancing
 depends
 on
 the
 allocation
 method
 used
 by
 the
 public
 insurer.
The
 allocation
 rule
 will
 also
 affect
 whom
 the
 public
 insurer
 treats.
 The
 average
 severity
 of
 those
 treated
 will
 be
 higher
under
 needs-based
 allocation
 than
 under
 random
 allocation
 because
 the
 public
 insurer
 treats
 the
 most
 severe
 cases
 under
needs-based
 allocation.
 Further,
 those
 remaining
 untreated
 will
 have
 lower
 average
 severities
 under
 needs-based
 allocation
than
 under
 random
 allocation.
 Finally,
 under
 needs-based
 allocation,
 the
 average
 severity
 of
 those
 treated
 privately
 will
be
 higher
 than
 the
 average
 severity
 of
 those
 who
 do
 not
 receive
 treatment
 but
 these
 average
 severities
 will
 be
 the
 same
under
 random
 allocation.
 Regardless
 of
 the
 allocation
 method,
 however,
 the
 average
 income
 of
 those
 treated
 through
 pri-
vate
 insurance
 will
 be
 higher
 than
 those
 treated
 by
 the
 public
 insurer
 because
 willingness-to-pay
 for
 private
 insurance
 is
increasing
 in
 income.
Cuff
 et
 al.
 (2012)
 also
 examine
 how
 changes
 in
 the
 size
 of
 the
 public
 insurer’s
 budget
 and
 in
 the
 supply
 of
 the
 health
 care
resource
 affect
 the
 equilibrium
 price
 of
 insurance
 and
 the
 probability
 of
 treatment
 by
 the
 public
 insurer.
2.2.1.
 Change
 in
 the
 ﬁxed
 supply
 of
 health
 care
 resources
An
 increase
 in
 the
 total
 supply
 of
 health
 care
 resources
 will
 always
 decrease
 the
 market
 price
 for
 private
 insurance
regardless
 of
 the
 public
 allocation
 rule.
 The
 lower
 price
 enables
 the
 public
 insurer
 to
 purchase
 more
 health
 care
 resources
and
 increases
 the
 probability
 of
 receiving
 public
 health
 care
 under
 either
 allocation
 rule
 with
 an
 increase
 in
 the
 supply
 of
health
 care
 resources.
2.2.2.
 Change
 in
 the
 size
 of
 the
 public
 insurer’s
 budget
With
 an
 increase
 in
 the
 size
 of
 the
 public
 insurer’s
 budget,
 the
 public
 insurer
 can
 afford
 more
 health
 care
 resources.
 This
increases
 the
 demand
 for
 health
 care
 resources
 and
 pushes
 up
 the
 price
 of
 health
 care
 resources.
 At
 the
 same
 time,
 an
 increase
in
 the
 budget
 increases
 the
 number
 of
 individuals
 who
 can
 be
 treated
 by
 the
 public
 insurer
 for
 a
 given
 price
 of
 the
 health
 care
resource,
 pushing
 up
 the
 probability
 of
 treatment
 in
 the
 public
 system
 and
 reducing
 the
 individuals’
 willingnesses-to-pay
for
 private
 insurance.
 This
 reduction
 in
 the
 demand
 for
 private
 health
 care
 pushes
 down
 the
 equilibrium
 price
 of
 the
 health
care
 resource.
 The
 net
 effect
 on
 the
 equilibrium
 price
 is
 ambiguous
 and
 may
 differ
 depending
 on
 the
 allocation
 method
 (Cuff
et
 al.,
 2012).
 The
 probability
 of
 treatment
 by
 the
 public
 insurer,
 however,
 is
 unambiguously
 increasing
 in
 the
 size
 of
 the
public
 insurer’s
 budget
 regardless
 of
 the
 allocation
 rule.
We
 use
 a
 laboratory
 experiment
 to
 test
 the
 theoretical
 predictions
 of
 Cuff
 et
 al.
 (2012)
 regarding
 how
 changes
 in
 the
 public
allocation
 rule,
 the
 public
 budget,
 and
 the
 supply
 of
 health
 care
 resources
 affect
 the
 equilibrium
 price
 of
 private
 insurance
and
 the
 equilibrium
 probability
 of
 treatment
 in
 the
 public
 system.
 Table

 the
 above
 theoretical
 predictions
assuming
 the
 speciﬁc
 parameters
 used
 in
 the
 laboratory
 environment
 described
 below.

 Laboratory
 implementation
To
 determine
 the
 effect
 of
 a
 change
 in
 the
 public
 allocation
 rule,
 public
 budget
 and
 the
 supply
 of
 health
 care
 resources
on
 the
 equilibrium
 price
 and
 probability
 of
 treatment
 in
 the
 public
 system,
 the
 laboratory
 experiment
 exogenously
 sets
 the
public
 sector’s
 allocation
 rule
 to
 be
 random
 allocation
 or
 needs-based
 allocation,
 the
 public
 sector
 budget
 at
 one
 of
 two
levels,
 and
 the
 total
 supply
 of
 health
 care
 resource
 at
 one
 of
 two
 levels.
 All
 three
 effects
 are
 tested
 using
 a
 between-subject
(between-session)
 design
 that
 exposes
 each
 subject
 to
 only
 one
 public
 allocation
 rule,
 one
 public
 budget,
 and
 one
 quantity
of
 health
 care
 resources.
 This

 leads

11 This
 result
 is
 consistent
 with
 empirical
 ﬁndings
 that
 increased
 public
 wait
 times
 lead
 to
 increased
 demand
 for
 private
 insurance
 (Pizer
 and
 Prentice,
2011).

of

 for
 the
 exogenous

 were
 chosen
 so
 as
 to
 generate

 benchmark
 outcomes
 for
 the
 eight
 treatments
 that
 differed
 sufﬁciently
 to
 enable
 us
 to
 identify
 treatment
 effects
using
 standard
 statistical
 methods.
 A
 total
 of
 32
 sessions
 (four
 for
 each
 treatment)
 with
 30
 decision
 periods
 in
 each
 session
were
 conducted.
 In
 each
 session,
 all
 10
 subjects
 saw
 the
 same
 public
 allocation
 rule,
 public
 budget,
 and
 quantity
 of
 health
care
 resource.
 This
 kept
 the
 environment
 easy
 to
 understand
 and
 eliminated
 the
 possibility
 of
 confounding
 and
 sequence
effects.
To
 create
 an
 environment
 corresponding
 to
 the
 theoretical
 environment
 of
 Cuff
 et
 al.
 (2012),  the
 experimental
 scenario
asked
 subjects
 to
 imagine
 they
 and
 the
 nine
 other
 subjects
 in
 their
 session
 were
 workers
 in
 a
 small
 country
 (i.e.,
 the
 population
of
 the
 country,
 N,
 is
 10).13 In
 this
 country:
• All
 workers
 get
 sick
 and
 need
 health
 care
 treatment
 to
 restore
 their
 health
 and
 avoid
 missing
 work
 time.14
• Sickness
 varies
 in
 severity
 and
 severity
 determines
 the
 proportion
 of
 work
 time
 a
 worker
 will
 miss
 if
 left
 untreated.
 The
only
 cost
 of
 sickness
 is
 lost
 income
 and,
 ultimately,
 lost
 consumption.
• All
 sickness
 is
 treatable
 and
 a
 treatment
 cures
 the
 sickness
 immediately,
 resulting
 in
 no
 loss
 of
 work
 time.
• Treatment
 requires
 one
 unit
 of
 the
 health
 care
 resource
 regardless
 of
 the
 severity
 of
 the
 illness.
• The
 supply
 of
 the
 health
 care
 resource
 is
 not
 sufﬁcient
 to
 treat
 everybody
 (i.e.,
 H
 <
 10).
 Hence,
 in
 each
 decision
 period
 some
workers
 will
 not
 receive
 treatment
 and
 will
 miss
 some
 work.
• The
 country
 has
 both
 a
 private
 insurer,
 which
 treats
 only
 workers
 who
 purchase
 private
 insurance
 at
 the
 start
 of
 the
 period,
before
 they
 know
 their
 severity,
 and
 a
 public
 insurer,
 which
 provides
 care
 free
 of
 charge
 to
 workers
 who
 do
 not
 purchase
private
 insurance
 and
 which
 rations
 care
 according
 to
 the
 stated
 allocation
 rule.
 Health
 care
 provided
 by
 the
 private
 insurer
and
 the
 public
 insurer
 is,
 in
 all
 other
 respects,
 identical.
• Because
 there
 are
 not
 enough
 health
 care
 resources
 to
 treat
 all
 workers,
 the
 private
 insurers
 and
 the
 public
 insurer
 bid
against
 one
 another
 in
 a
 market
 to
 obtain
 health
 resources.
 The
 private
 insurer
 bids
 for
 health
 care
 resources
 based
 on
how
 much
 the
 workers
 are
 willing
 to
 pay
 for
 private
 insurance.
 The
 public
 insurer
 has
 a
 ﬁxed
 budget
 provided
 by
 the
government
 and
 bids
 according
 to
 its
 maximum
 ability
 to
 pay.
 A
 price
 that
 clears
 the
 health
 care
 resource
 market
 is
 then
determined.
• If
 a
 subject
 purchases
 private
 insurance,
 the
 subject
 is
 guaranteed
 treatment,
 does
 not
 miss
 any
 work
 and
 does
 not
 lose
any
 income,
 but
 must
 pay
 for
 private
 insurance
 out
 of
 their
 income.
 If
 a
 subject
 does
 not
 purchase
 private
 insurance,
two
 outcomes
 are
 possible:
 (a)
 the
 subject
 is
 selected
 for
 public
 treatment,
 the
 treatment
 is
 free
 and
 the
 subject
 loses
 no
income;
 (b)
 the
 subject
 is
 not
 selected
 for
 public
 treatment,
 remains
 sick,
 misses
 work
 in
 accordance
 with
 their
 severity
and
 loses
 the
 associated
 income.
Each
 session
 proceeded
 as
 follows.
 Subjects
 were
 told
 the
 public
 allocation
 rule
 (random
 or
 needs-based),
 the
 lab
 dollar
(L$)
 value
 of
 the
 public
 budget
 (L$430
 or
 L$720),
 the
 supply
 of
 the
 health
 care
 resource
 (H
 =
 5
 or
 H
 =
 8)
 and
 their

 referring
 to

 of
 the

 parameters,
 which
 are
exogenously

 during
 the
 experiment;
 and
 health

 treatment
 to
 cure
 sickness,
 which
 is
 an
 outcome
 of
 interest.
 We  have
 tried
 to
 make
 clear
 by
the
 context
 which
 meaning
 is
 intended
 in
 each
 instance
 that
 we
 use
 the
 term.

 that

 while
 our

 is
 a

 We  discuss

assigned
 incomes
 in
 lab
 dollars.
 Each
 subject
 received
 a
 randomly
 assigned,
 unique
 income
 that
 remained
 constant
 through-
out
 the
 30-period
 session.
 The
 unique
 income
 was
 drawn
 from
 a
 distribution
 with
 10
 values
 that
 ranged
 from
 L$50
 to
 L$950
in
 increments
 of
 L$100,
 with
 an
 average
 income
 across
 subjects
 of
 L$500.
 Subjects’
 assigned
 incomes
 are
 their
 maximum
possible
 employment
 incomes
 for
 each
 period.
At
 the
 beginning
 of
 each
 decision
 period,
 the
 subjects
 were
 reminded
 of
 their
 incomes,
 the
 public
 allocation
 rule,
 the
total
 public
 budget,
 and
 the
 total
 amount
 of
 health
 care
 resources
 available.
 Subjects
 were
 also
 informed
 of
 the
 number
of
 people
 who
 received
 treatment
 by
 each
 of
 the
 private
 and
 public
 insurers
 in
 the
 previous
 period.15 Subjects
 were
 then
asked
 to
 state
 how
 much
 they
 were
 willing
 to
 pay
 for
 private
 insurance
 (note
 that
 this
 was
 before
 subjects
 learned
 their
randomly
 assigned
 level
 of
 sickness
 severity
 for
 the
 period).
 These
 WTP
 values
 were
 then
 used
 by
 the
 private
 insurers
 to
 bid
for
 resources.
 The
 public
 insurer
 bid
 for
 resources
 based
 on
 its
 budget.
 The
 market
 price
 of
 the
 resource,
 or
 equivalently
 the
market
 price
 of
 insurance
 (since
 treatment
 requires
 one
 unit
 of
 the
 resource),
 was
 determined
 as
 the
 price
 that
 equated
 the
aggregate
 demand
 for
 the
 health
 care
 resource
 to
 the
 ﬁxed
 supply
 of
 the
 resource.
3.1.
 Determination
 of
 equilibrium
The
 public
 insurer
 submitted
 a
 schedule
 of
 bids
 according
 to
 its
 ability-to-pay,
 seeking
 to
 purchase
 as
 many
 units
 of
 the
health
 care
 resource
 as
 possible.
 It
 was
 willing
 to
 pay
 its
 entire
 budget
 for
 one
 unit
 of
 the
 health
 care
 resource,
 half
 its
 budget
for
 each
 of
 two
 units,
 and
 so
 on.
 The
 WTP
 schedule
 for
 the
 public
 insurer
 was
 given
 by
 {B/1,
 B/2,
 .
 .
 .
 ,
 B/H}.
 The
 private
 insurer
submitted
 a
 schedule
 of
 bids
 according
 to
 each
 subject’s
 willingness
 to
 pay,
 WTPi,
 for
 i
 =
 1,
 .
 .
 .,
 10.
 The
 willingness-to-pay
schedule
 for
 the
 private
 insurer
 was
 given
 by
 {WTP1,
 WTP2,
 .
 .
 .
 ,
 WTP10}.
To
 clear
 the
 market,
 the
 schedule
 of
 public
 bids
 and
 private
 bids
 were
 combined
 and
 sorted
 from
 highest
 to
 lowest:
 {Bid1,
Bid2,
 .
 .
 .,  Bidk},
 with
 Bid1 being
 the
 highest
 WTP
 and
 Bidk being
 the
 lowest
 WTP,
 where
 k
 =
 10
 +
 H.
 The
 H
 units
 of
 the
 health
care
 resource
 were
 allocated
 to
 Bid1 through
 BidH and
 sold
 at
 a
 market
 price
 equal
 to
 the
 midpoint
 between
 BidH (the
 lowest
accepted
 bid)
 and
 BidH+1 (the
 highest
 rejected
 bid).
 Therefore,
 the
 market-clearing
 price
 was
 P
 =
 (BidH +
 BidH+1)/2.
 This
 pricing
institution
 can
 be
 thought
 of
 as
 a
 sealed
 bid
 uniform-price
 call
 auction
 involving
 limit
 orders
 using
 a
 mid-point
 price
 rule.16
Unlike
 other
 pricing
 institutions,
 such
 a
 call
 auction
 works
 well
 in
 our
 demand-centred
 environment
 with
 a
 ﬁxed
 supply
constraint.
If
 a
 subject’s
 submitted
 WTP
 was
 greater
 than
 the
 market
 price
 of
 insurance,
 they
 purchased
 private
 insurance
 at
 the
market
 price
 (which
 may
 have
 been
 lower
 than
 their
 WTP).
 Given
 the
 market
 price,
 the
 ﬁxed
 supply
 of
 the
 health
 care
resource
 was
 then
 allocated
 between
 the
 private
 insurer
 and
 the
 public
 insurer
 in
 accordance
 with
 the
 number
 of
 private
insurance
 contracts
 purchased.
At
 this
 point,
 each
 subject
 was
 assigned
 a
 sickness
 severity
 level
 randomly
 drawn
 from
 a
 uniform
 distribution
 between
0.01
 and
 1.00
 (in
 increments
 of
 0.01).
 Each
 subject’s
 treatment
 status
 was
 then
 determined.
 Those
 who
 purchased
 private
insurance
 were
 treated
 regardless
 of
 their
 severity
 level.
 For
 those
 who
 relied
 on
 the
 public
 system,
 treatment
 status
 was
determined
 by
 the
 public
 allocation
 rule.
 If
 the
 rule
 was
 needs-based
 allocation,
 those
 with
 the
 greatest
 severity
 (among
those
 relying
 on
 the
 public
 system)
 received
 treatment;
 if
 the
 rule
 was
 random,
 subjects
 were
 randomly
 chosen
 for
 treat-
ment
 regardless
 of
 their
 severity
 level.
 Each
 subject’s
 ﬁnal
 income
 was
 then
 determined.
 For
 those
 who
 purchased
 private
insurance,
 ﬁnal
 income
 was
 assigned
 income
 less
 the
 price
 of
 insurance;
 for
 those
 treated
 by
 the
 public
 insurer,
 ﬁnal
 income
equaled
 assigned
 income;
 and
 for
 those
 who
 did
 not
 receive
 treatment,
 ﬁnal
 income
 equaled
 assigned
 income
 times
 one
minus
 their
 severity
 level
 (i.e.,
 (1
 −
 s)Y).
 At
 the
 end
 of
 a
 session,
 each
 subject’s
 cumulative
 payout
 in
 lab
 dollars
 was
 converted
into
 Canadian
 dollars
 using
 a
 conversion
 rate
 provided
 to
 subjects
 at
 the
 beginning
 of
 the
 session.
Given
 the
 discrete
 nature
 of
 the
 experiment
 with
 ten
 subjects
 in
 each
 session,
 the
 determination
 of
 the
 equilibrium
probability
 of
 treatment
 in
 the
 public
 system
 and
 the
 calculation
 of
 expected
 severities
 have
 to
 be
 addressed.
3.1.1.
 Determination
 of
 the
 equilibrium
 probability
 of
 treatment
In
 this
 environment,
 the
 probability
 of
 treatment
 in
 the
 public
 system
 has
 a
 discrete
 ﬁnite
 distribution.
 Because
 the
people
 who
 purchase
 private
 insurance
 do
 not
 require
 public
 health
 care,
 the
 probability
 of
 treatment
 in
 the
 public
system
 is
 simply
 equal
 to
 the
 proportion
 of
 individuals
 without
 private
 insurance
 (regardless
 of
 allocation
 rule)
 and
 is
given
 by
 
 =
 (H
 −
 Nr)/(10
 –
 Nr),
 where
 Nr is
 the
 number
 of
 health
 care
 resources
 purchased
 by
 the
 private
 insurer.
 There-
fore,
 the
 maximum
 willingness-to-pay
 of
 an
 individual
 with
 given
 income
 Y
 can
 be
 written
 as
 WTP
 =
 (1
 −
 )E(s|no
 public
care)Y
 =
 ((10
 −
 H)/(10
 −
 Nr))E(s|no
 public
 care)Y.
 The
 individuals’
 and
 public’s
 willingnesses-to-pay
 along
 with
 the
 ﬁxed
 sup-
ply
 of
 health
 care
 resources
 determine
 the
 market-clearing
 price,
 P.
 Finally,
 the
 discrete
 number
 of
 individuals
 with
 WTPs
greater
 than
 P
 determines
 the
 number
 of
 individuals
 who
 purchase
 private
 insurance
 and
 thus,
 the
 probability
 of
 treatment
in
 the
 public
 system.
15 In
 addition
 to
 following
 computerized
 instructions
 and
 answering
 a
 few
 comprehension
 questions
 regarding
 the
 basic
 framework
 of
 the
 experiment,
all
 subjects
 participated
 in
 a
 practice
 round
 prior
 to
 the
 start
 of
 the
 experiment.
16 Cason
 and
 Friedman
 (1997)
 found
 that
 call
 auctions
 using
 a
 mid-point
 price
 rule
 rather
 than
 a
 ceiling-
 or
 ﬂoor-pricing
 rule
 better
 induced
 subjects
 to
reveal
 their
 true
 underlying
 values.

3.1.2.
 Calculation
 of
 expected
 severities
The
 expected
 severity
 of
 an
 individual
 who
 is
 not
 treated
 in
 the
 public
 system
 will
 depend
 on
 the
 allocation
 rule.
 Severity
is
 uniformly
 distributed
 among
 individuals
 on
 the
 discrete
 interval
 [0.01,
 1].17 If
 the
 public
 sector
 allocates
 treatments
randomly,
 an
 individual’s
 expected
 severity,
 if
 not
 treated,
 is
 ER(s|no
 public
 care)
 =
 0.505.
 However,
 if
 the
 public
 sector
 allocates
treatments
 on
 the
 basis
 of
 need,
 determining
 an
 individual’s
 expected
 severity
 if
 not
 treated
 is
 more
 complicated.
 Assuming
a
 continuous
 uniform
 severity
 distribution
 with
 support
 on
 the
 unit
 interval,
 the
 expected
 severity
 if
 not
 treated
 under
needs-based
 allocation
 is
 simply
 EN(s|no
 public
 care)
 =
 (1
 −
 N)/2.
 However,
 the
 experimental
 environment
 differs
 from
 the
continuous
 theoretical
 model
 because
 it
 involves:
 (i)
 10
 discrete
 individuals
 instead
 of
 a
 continuum
 of
 individuals,
 (ii)
 discrete
severities
 in
 increments
 of
 0.01,
 and
 (iii)
 a
 truncated
 support
 on
 the
 unit
 interval
 [0.01,
 1]
 instead
 of
 full
 support
 on
 the
 unit
interval
 [0,1].
 Therefore,
 the
 expected
 severity
 of
 an
 untreated
 individual
 in
 the
 experiment
 requires
 the
 calculation
 of
 the
expected
 severity
 of
 the
 10
 −H
 individuals
 who
 did
 not
 receive
 public
 treatment
 given
 the
 10
 −
 Nr individuals
 who
 rely
 on
 the
public
 insurer.
 Thus,
 an
 individual
 would
 want
 to
 know
 the
 expected
 severity
 of
 the
 lowest
 k
 =
 10
 −
 H
 untreated
 subjects
 given
the
 n
 =
 10
 −
 Nr random
 severities
 chosen
 on
 a
 discrete
 uniform
 interval
 [0.01,
 1]
 that
 did
 not
 purchase
 private
 insurance.
 Such
an
 expected
 severity
 (i.e.,
 one
 that
 meets
 requirements
 (i),
 (ii)
 and
 (iii)
 above)
 is
 given
 by
 a
 shifted
 beta
 distribution
 and
 not
by
 a
 continuous
 uniform
 distribution
 as
 described
 above.18 This
 change
 will
 cause
 the
 predicted
 individual
 WTPs
 to
 slightly
increase
 since
 they
 are
 a
 function
 of
 E(s|no
 public
 care).
 However,
 the
 parameter
 sets
 for
 the
 experiment
 were
 chosen
 so
 that
the
 equilibrium
 predictions
 for
 the
 number
 of
 private
 contracts
 and
 the
 probability
 of
 being
 treated
 by
 the
 public
 system
 are
the
 same
 regardless
 of
 whether
 subjects
 correctly
 use
 the
 shifted
 beta
 distribution
 (which
 seems
 unlikely)
 or
 naively
 form
expectations
 consistent
 with
 the
 much
 more
 straight-forward
 assumption
 of
 the
 continuous
 uniform
 distribution.19
3.2.
 Public-ﬁnancing-only
 counterfactual
Cuff
 et
 al.
 (2012)
 compare
 the
 theoretical
 mixed
 ﬁnancing
 model
 with
 a
 model
 of
 public
 ﬁnancing
 only
 in
 which
 individuals
are
 not
 able
 to
 purchase
 private
 insurance.
 Because
 there
 are
 no
 WTP
 decisions
 for
 subjects
 to
 make
 in
 the
 environment
with
 public
 ﬁnancing
 only,
 it
 is
 not
 necessary
 to
 run
 a
 separate
 experiment
 to
 identify
 the
 outcomes
 in
 an
 environment
 with
public
 ﬁnancing
 only.
 For
 our
 parameter
 set
 involving
 random
 and
 needs-based
 allocation,
 health
 care
 resources
 (either
 H
 =
 5
or
 H
 =
 8),
 and
 a
 public
 sector
 health
 care
 budget
 (B
 =
 430
 or
 B
 =
 720),
 we  can
 determine
 the
 outcomes
 of
 a
 public
 ﬁnancing
only
 “experiment”
 using
 the
 raw
 data
 underlying
 our
 32
 laboratory
 sessions.
 Namely,
 for
 each
 subject
 in
 each
 period,
we
 know
 their
 income,
 randomly
 drawn
 severity,
 and
 randomly
 drawn
 place
 in
 queue
 (required
 for
 sessions
 involving
 a
public
 sector
 random
 allocation
 rule),
 in
 addition
 to
 the
 exogenous
 treatment
 variables.
 From
 this
 we  can
 calculate
 the
counterfactual
 outcome
 of
 a
 health
 system
 that
 involves
 public
 ﬁnancing
 only.
 This
 kind
 of
 paired
 analysis
 is
 only
 possible
with
 experimental
 data
 since
 it
 necessarily
 holds
 everything
 constant
 in
 the
 environment
 except
 for
 one
 thing:
 it
 removes
 the
possibility
 for
 purchasing
 private
 insurance.
 We  refer
 to
 this
 exercise
 as
 a
 public-ﬁnancing-only
 counterfactual
 to
 emphasize
that
 the
 outcomes
 are
 not
 behaviourally
 driven
 but
 are
 mathematically
 determined.
 The
 results
 of
 the
 public-ﬁnancing-only
treatments
 are
 presented
 in

 Data
 collection
Thirty-two
 sessions
 of
 10
 participants
 each
 were
 administered
 in
 the
 McMaster
 University
 Experimental
 Economics
Laboratory.
 The
 experiments
 were
 run
 using
 the
 z-Tree
 software
 program
 (Fischbacher,
 2007).
 The
 McMaster
 University
Research
 Ethics
 Board
 approved
 the
 protocol
 with
 respect
 to
 the
 use
 of
 human
 subjects.
 Sessions
 included
 15
 min
 of
 onscreen
instructions,
 examples
 and
 a
 practice
 period
 followed
 by
 the
 main
 30-period
 session
 and
 a
 short
 questionnaire.
 Sessions
lasted,
 on
 average,
 70
 min.
 At
 the
 end
 of
 the
 experiment,
 subject’s
 30-period
 cumulative
 earnings
 were
 converted
 into
Canadian
 dollars
 using
 an
 exchange
 rate
 that
 was
 chosen
 to
 maximize
 the
 saliency
 of
 their
 decisions.
 Subjects’
 average
earnings
 were
 $25.50
 and
 they
 were
 paid
 privately
 in
 cash
 following
 the
 session.
 After
 taking
 part
 in
 the
 mixed
 system
of
 health
 care
 ﬁnancing
 environment,
 subjects
 participated
 in
 an
 individual
 non-strategic
 risk-preference
 elicitation
 task.
17 A
 value
 of
 zero
 was
 not
 included
 in
 the
 severity
 distribution
 to
 eliminate
 a
 possible
 “full
 health”
 focal
 point
 for
 subjects.
18 A
 beta
 distribution,
 B(m,
 n
 +
 1
 −
 m),  represents
 the
 distribution
 of
 the
 mth-lowest
 values
 from
 a
 draw
 of
 n
 on
 the
 unit
 interval
 [0,
 1].
 The
 expected
 value
of
 the
 beta-distribution
 is
 given
 by
 m/(n
 +
 1).
 However,
 the
 expected
 value
 of
 the
 k
 lowest
 values
 from
 a
 drawing
 of
 n
 is
 equal
 to
 (k
 +
 1)/(2(n
 +
 1)),
 where
 in
our
 context
 k
 =
 10
 −
 H
 (i.e.
 the
 number
 of
 untreated
 individuals)
 and
 n
 =
 10
 −
 Nr (i.e.
 the
 number
 of
 individuals
 without
 private
 insurance).
 Simulations
 with
the
 beta
 distribution
 show
 that
 drawing
 from
 a
 discrete
 [0.1,
 1]
 interval
 instead
 of
 the
 unit
 interval
 [0,
 1]
 simply
 increases
 the
 expected
 value
 by
 0.005.
Therefore,
 the
 expected
 severity
 of
 the
 untreated
 under
 needs-based
 allocation
 is
 E(s|untreated)
 =
 (10
 −
 H
 +
 1)/(2(10
 −
 Nr +
 1))
 +
 0.005.
19 Smith
 et
 al.
 (1982)
 discuss
 the
 rationale
 for
 supporting
 Nash
 versus
 competitive
 equilibrium
 predictions
 in
 sealed
 bid-offer
 auctions
 similar
 to
 the
 one
used
 here.
 The
 authors
 ﬁnd
 that
 over
 a
 short
 number
 of
 periods,
 experimental
 markets
 using
 this
 institution
 converge
 close
 to
 the
 competitive
 equilibrium,
even
 with
 as
 few
 as
 6
 traders.
 We chose
 parameter
 values
 for
 H
 and
 B
 such
 that
 there
 is
 a
 unique
 Nash
 equilibrium
 prediction
 for
 each
 experimental
treatment
 and
 that
 this
 equilibrium
 is
 also
 a
 competitive
 equilibrium.
 Therefore,
 regardless
 of
 whether
 subjects
 were
 behaving
 as
 price-takers
 as
 we
would
 expect
 in
 a
 large
 ﬁeld
 setting
 or
 if
 they
 believed
 they
 could
 manipulate
 the
 market,
 once
 the
 market
 converges
 to
 the
 predicted
 equilibrium
 in
 this
environment,
 no
 subject
 would
 have
 an
 incentive
 to
 change
 their
 WTP
 in
 order
 to
 inﬂuence
 the
 public
 and
 private
 insurance
 market
 allocation.

 a

 the

 instrument
 reported
 in

 Experimental
 results
We
 begin
 by
 examining
 the
 impact
 of
 the
 exogenous
 treatment
 variables
 – resource
 allocation
 rule,
 supply
 of
 health
 care
resource,
 and
 public
 sector
 budget
 –
 on
 the
 market
 price
 for
 insurance
 and
 the
 probability
 of
 being
 treated
 by
 the
 public
system.
 The
 statistical
 analysis
 presented
 in
 Sections
 4.1–4.4
 is
 based
 on
 regressing
 the
 three
 exogenous
 treatment
 dummy
variables,
 and
 their
 interactions,
 on
 key
 indicators
 for
 the
 32
 independent
 session
 observations.
4.1.
 Market
 price
 of
 insurance
We
 examine
 two
 aspects
 of
 the
 market
 price
 of
 private
 health
 insurance.
 First,
 we  compare
 the
 observed
 and
 predicted
changes
 in
 market
 price
 associated
 with
 changes
 in
 experimental
 treatment
 (allocation
 rule,
 supply
 of
 the
 health
 care
resource,
 and
 public
 budget).
 Second,
 we
 compare
 the
 observed
 mean
 price
 to
 the
 prices
 derived
 from
 the
 counterfactual
 of
a
 public-ﬁnancing-only
 system
 with
 no
 private
 insurance.
Columns
 1–3
 of
 Table
 2
 present
 information
 on
 the
 market
 price.
 The
 top
 panel
 (a)
 presents
 aggregated
 information
 on
the
 mean
 price
 for
 each
 treatment
 dimension;
 the
 lower
 panel
 (b)
 presents
 disaggregated
 information
 for
 each
 combination
of
 experimental
 parameters.
 The
 table
 presents
 results
 based
 on
 all
 periods
 and
 results
 based
 on
 only
 the
 last
 ten
 periods.
 A
comparison
 reveals
 no
 meaningful
 difference
 between
 them,
 indicating
 that
 any
 learning
 effects
 are
 small.
 In
 Section
 5
 we
focus
 on
 the
 results
 for
 all
 periods.
The
 ﬁrst
 row
 of
 panel
 (a)
 presents
 the
 overall
 means:
 the
 overall
 mean
 market
 price
 across
 all
 periods
 and
 treatments
is
 L$173.27.
 The
 aggregate
 data
 in
 panel
 (a)
 also
 show
 that
 the
 observed
 market
 price
 is
 always
 greater
 than
 the
 predicted
market
 price
 and
 this
 is
 also
 true
 for
 most
 treatments
 in
 panel
 (b).
 The
 observed
 market
 price
 is
 signiﬁcantly
 greater
 than
predicted
 at
 the
 5
 percent
 level
 for
 all
 treatments
 listed
 in
 panel
 (b)
 except
 for
 the
 two
 treatments
 under
 random
 allocation
with
 a
 budget
 of
 430,
 for
 which
 there
 is
 no
 signiﬁcant
 difference.
 In
 addition,
 there
 are
 signiﬁcant
 market
 price
 differences
across
 the
 three
 exogenous
 variables:
 the
 public
 sector
 allocation
 rule,
 the
 supply
 of
 health
 care
 resources,
 and
 the
 size
 of
the
 public
 health
 care
 budget.
 We  examine
 each
 in
 turn.
4.1.1.
 Impact
 of
 the
 allocation
 rule
 on
 market
 price
As
 predicted
 by
 the
 model,
 Table
 2
 panel
 (a)
 shows
 that
 the
 market
 price
 was
 higher
 under
 random
 allocation
 than
 under
needs-based
 allocation:
 the
 mean
 price
 of
 private
 insurance
 under
 the
 needs-based
 rule
 was
 L$163.07;
 the
 mean
 market
price
 under
 random
 allocation
 was
 L$183.48.
 The
 difference
 in
 price
 between
 the
 two
 allocation
 rules
 (L$20.41)
 is
 statistically
signiﬁcant
 (p
 <
 0.001).
 Although
 the
 observed
 difference
 is
 in
 the
 direction
 predicted
 by
 the
 theory,
 the
 observed
 difference
is
 less
 than
 the
 predicted
 difference
 of
 L$55.43
 (p
 <
 0.001).
 The
 disaggregated
 results
 in
 panel
 (b)
 of
 Table
 2
 conﬁrm
 that
 the
mean
 price
 of
 private
 insurance
 is
 higher
 for
 each
 experimental
 treatment
 with
 random
 allocation
 than
 in
 the
 corresponding
case
 with
 needs-based
 allocation.
4.1.2.
 Impact
 of
 health
 care
 resource
 supply
 on
 market
 price
The
 mean
 market
 price
 when
 the
 supply
 of
 the
 health
 care
 resource
 was
 low
 (H
 =
 5)
 was
 L$238.68;
 the
 mean
 market
price
 when
 H
 =
 8
 was
 L$107.86.
 The
 difference
 in
 the
 mean
 prices
 (L$130.82)
 is
 statistically
 signiﬁcant
 (p
 <
 0.001).
 Although
the
 observed
 difference
 is
 in
 the
 direction
 predicted
 by
 the
 theory,
 the
 observed
 difference
 is
 marginally
 signiﬁcantly
 more
than
 the
 predicted
 difference
 of
 L$120.29
 (p
 =
 0.059).
 The
 disaggregated
 results
 presented
 in
 panel
 (b)
 of
 Table
 2
 are
 also
consistent
 with
 the
 theoretical
 predictions:
 the
 mean
 price
 is
 higher
 for
 each
 treatment
 with
 a
 supply
 of
 5
 units
 of
 the
 health
care
 resource
 than
 in
 the
 corresponding
 treatment
 with
 a
 supply
 of
 8
 units.
4.1.3.
 Impact
 of
 the
 size
 of
 the
 public
 health
 care
 budget
 on
 market
 price
The
 mean
 market
 price
 for
 private
 insurance
 when
 B
 =
 430
 was
 L$157.73;
 the
 mean
 market
 price
 when
 B
 =
 720
 was
L$188.82.
 The
 difference
 in
 mean
 prices
 was
 L$31.09
 and
 is
 statistically
 signiﬁcant
 (p
 <
 0.001).
 However,
 the
 observed
difference
 is
 in
 the
 opposite
 direction
 of
 the
 predicted
 difference
 (−L$7.89)
 and
 is
 statistically
 signiﬁcant
 (p
 <
 0.001).
 The
disaggregate
 results
 in
 panel
 (b)
 of
 Table
 2
 provide
 some
 insight
 into
 this
 ﬁnding.
 When
 the
 prediction
 is
 that
 an
 increase
in
 public
 budget
 will
 result
 in
 an
 increase
 in
 market
 price,
 the
 behavioural
 evidence
 supports
 the
 prediction
 (L$28.82
 of
the
 L$34.23
 price
 increase
 is
 realized
 for
 H
 =
 8
 under
 needs-based
 allocation).
 However,
 when
 the
 prediction
 is
 that
 a
 public
budget
 increase
 will
 result
 in
 a
 market
 price
 decrease,
 we
 ﬁnd
 that
 the
 market
 price
 increases
 in
 every
 case
 (a
 L$32.49
 price
increase
 was
 observed
 when
 a
 L$52.04
 price
 reduction
 was
 predicted
 for
 H
 =
 5
 under
 needs-based
 allocation,
 a
 L$22.39
 price
increase
 was
 observed
 when
 a
 L$12.81
 price
 reduction
 was
 predicted
 for
 H
 =
 5
 under
 random
 allocation
 and
 a
 L$40.67
 price
increase
 was
 observed
 when
 a
 L$0.94
 price
 reduction
 was
 predicted
 for
 H
 =
 8
 under
 random
 allocation).
 The
 increased
 budget
in
 these
 three
 cases
 increases
 the
 likelihood
 of
 being
 treated
 in
 the
 public
 system
 and
 therefore
 should
 result
 in
 individuals
being
 willing
 to
 pay
 less
 for
 private
 insurance.
 At
 the
 same
 time,
 the
 higher
 public
 budget
 allows
 the
 public
 insurer
 to
 bid
more
 for
 health
 care
 resources.
 The
 predicted
 net
 effect
 on
 the
 equilibrium
 price
 is
 negative.
 The
 deviation
 in
 the
 observed
market
 price
 from
 the
 predicted
 price
 appears
 to
 result
 from
 subjects
 not
 appreciating
 the
 extent
 to
 which
 a
 larger
 public
budget
 will
 increase
 their
 chance
 of
 public
 treatment
 and
 thus
 they
 do
 not
 reduce
 their
 WTP
 for
 private
 insurance
 by
 the
amount
 predicted
 by
 the
 theory.
 Instead,
 subjects
 are
 found
 to
 increase
 their
 WTP
 for
 private
 insurance
 when
 the
 public
724

 729
budget
 increases
 in
 these
 three
 treatments,
 which
 is
 consistent
 with
 an
 (erroneous)
 instinct
 to
 compete
 with
 the
 public
sector
 insurer
 to
 guarantee
 they
 get
 to
 the
 front
 of
 the
 queue
 with
 the
 private
 insurer.
4.1.4.
 Public-ﬁnancing-only
 counterfactual
Column
 4
 in
 Table
 2
 shows
 the
 mean
 market
 price
 for
 health
 care
 resources
 when
 there
 is
 only
 a
 public
 insurer.
 The
market
 price
 under
 public
 ﬁnancing
 only
 is
 independent
 of
 the
 allocation
 rule
 and
 is
 determined
 by
 the
 public
 insurer’s
budget
 divided
 by
 the
 number
 of
 health
 care
 resources.
 Table
 2
 panel
 (a)
 shows
 that
 the
 overall
 mean
 market
 price
 for
health
 care
 resources
 is
 higher
 under
 mixed
 private
 ﬁnancing
 (L$173.27)
 than
 under
 public
 ﬁnancing
 only
 (L$87.28)
 for
 a
mean
 difference
 of
 L$85.99.
 The
 mean
 market
 price
 is
 signiﬁcantly
 higher
 under
 mixed
 private
 and
 public
 ﬁnancing
 for
 all
eight
 experimental
 treatment
 combinations
 (all
 p-values
 <
 0.01)
 as
 shown
 in
 panel
 (b)
 of
 Table
 2.
4.2.
 The
 probability
 of
 being
 treated
 by
 the
 public
 system
 and
 number
 of
 private
 health
 care
 contracts
Two
 additional
 outcome
 measures
 of
 interest
 are
 the
 probability
 of
 being
 treated
 by
 the
 public
 system
 ()
 and
 the
 number
of
 private
 health
 care
 resources
 purchased
 (Nr).
 Depending
 on
 the
 exogenously
 set
 value
 for
 number
 of
 health
 care
 resources
(H),
 
 and
 Nr are
 related
 by
 the
 identity
 
 =
 (H
 −
 Nr)/(10
 −
 Nr).
 We  focus
 our
 analysis
 on
 the
 probability
 of
 being
 treated
 by
the
 public
 sector,
 ,
 which
 depends
 on
 the
 public
 sector
 allocation
 rule,
 the
 supply
 of
 health
 care
 resources,
 and
 the
 public
health
 care
 budget.
Table
 3
 is
 structured
 in
 a
 similar
 manner
 as
 Table
 2
 and
 presents
 information
 on
 the
 predicted
 mean
 probability
 of
treatment
 in
 the
 public
 system
 and
 the
 mean
 observed
 probability
 of
 public
 treatment
 both
 across
 all
 30
 periods
 and
 only
for
 the
 last
 10
 periods.
 Focusing
 ﬁrst
 on
 the
 aggregate
 results
 in
 panel
 (a),
 a
 number
 of
 patterns
 are
 notable.
 First,
 the
observed
 probability
 of
 public
 treatment
 is
 lower
 than
 predicted
 in
 all
 treatments.
 Subjects
 systematically
 purchase
 more
private
 insurance
 contracts
 than
 predicted.
 The
 observed
 probability
 of
 public
 treatment
 is
 signiﬁcantly
 lower
 than
 predicted
at
 the
 5
 percent
 level
 for
 all
 treatments
 listed
 in
 Table
 3
 panel
 (b)
 except
 for
 the
 two
 treatments
 under
 random
 allocation
with
 a
 budget
 of
 430.
 In
 addition,
 there
 are
 signiﬁcant
 differences
 in
 the
 probabilities
 of
 being
 treated
 in
 the
 public
 sector
across
 the
 three
 exogenous
 variables:
 the
 public
 sector
 allocation
 rule,
 the
 supply
 of
 health
 care
 resources,
 and
 the
 size
 of
the
 public
 health
 care
 budget.
 We  examine
 each
 in
 turn.
4.2.1.
 Impact
 of
 the
 allocation
 rule
 on
 probability
 of
 public
 treatment
As
 stated
 above,
 subjects
 tend
 to
 purchase
 more
 private
 insurance
 than
 predicted.
 Panel
 (a)
 in
 Table
 3
 shows
 that
 this
tendency
 was
 substantially
 larger
 for
 needs-based
 allocation
 than
 for
 random
 allocation.
 Considering
 all
 30
 periods,
 the
mean
 difference
 in
 proportion
 between
 the
 observed
 mean
 probability
 of
 public
 treatment
 and
 the
 predicted
 probability
was
 almost
 20
 percent
 for
 needs-based
 allocation
 treatments
 and
 only
 approximately
 9
 percent
 for
 random
 allocation
treatments.
 As
 predicted
 by
 the
 model,
 panel
 (a)
 shows
 that
 the
 probability
 of
 public
 treatment
 was
 higher
 under
 needs-
based
 allocation
 than
 under
 random
 allocation:
 the
 mean
 probability
 of
 public
 treatment
 under
 the
 needs-based
 rule
 was
0.501;
 the
 mean
 probability
 of
 public
 treatment
 under
 random
 allocation
 was
 0.459.
 The
 difference
 in
 probability
 between
the
 two
 allocation
 rules
 (0.042)
 is
 statistically
 signiﬁcant
 (p
 <
 0.001).
 Although
 the
 observed
 difference
 is
 in
 the
 direction
predicted
 by
 the
 theory,
 the
 observed
 difference
 is
 less
 than
 the
 predicted
 difference
 of
 0.098
 (p
 <
 0.001).
 The
 disaggregated
results
 in
 panel
 (b)
 of
 Table
 3
 conﬁrm
 that
 the
 mean
 probability
 of
 public
 treatment
 is
 higher
 for
 each
 experimental
 treatment
with
 needs-based
 allocation
 than
 in
 the
 corresponding
 case
 with
 random
 allocation.
4.2.2.
 Impact
 of
 health
 care
 resource
 supply
 on
 probability
 of
 public
 treatment
The
 mean
 probability
 of
 public
 treatment
 when
 the
 supply
 of
 the
 health
 care
 resource
 was
 low
 (H
 =
 5)
 was
 0.261;
 the
mean
 probability
 of
 public
 treatment
 when
 H
 =
 8
 was
 0.699.
 The
 difference
 in
 the
 mean
 probabilities
 (0.438)
 is
 statistically
signiﬁcant
 (p
 <
 0.001)
 and
 is
 not
 signiﬁcantly
 different
 from
 the
 predicted
 difference
 of
 0.428
 (p
 =
 0.340).
 The
 disaggregated
results
 presented
 in
 panel
 (b)
 of
 Table
 3
 are
 also
 consistent
 with
 the
 theoretical
 predictions:
 the
 mean
 probability
 is
 higher
for
 each
 treatment
 with
 a
 supply
 of
 8
 units
 of
 the
 health
 care
 resource
 than
 in
 the
 corresponding
 treatment
 with
 a
 supply
 of
5
 units.
4.2.3.
 Impact
 of
 the
 size
 of
 the
 public
 health
 care
 budget
 on
 probability
 of
 public
 treatment
The
 mean
 probability
 of
 public
 treatment
 for
 private
 insurance
 when
 B
 =
 430
 was
 0.440;
 the
 mean
 probability
 of
 public
treatment
 when
 B
 =
 720
 was
 0.520.
 The
 difference
 in
 mean
 probabilities
 was
 0.08
 and
 is
 statistically
 signiﬁcant
 (p
 <
 0.001).
Although
 the
 observed
 difference
 is
 in
 the
 direction
 predicted
 by
 the
 theory,
 the
 observed
 difference
 is
 less
 than
 the
 predicted
difference
 of
 0.132
 (p
 <
 0.001).
 From
 the
 disaggregate
 results
 in
 panel
 (b)
 of
 Table
 3,
 the
 differences
 in
 probabilities
 when
budget
 increases
 are
 always
 in
 the
 predicted
 direction
 except
 for
 when
 the
 budget
 increases
 from
 L$430
 to
 L$720
 under
needs-based
 allocation
 and
 H
 =
 8,
 in
 which
 case
 the
 probability
 of
 being
 treated
 publicly
 increases
 from
 0.698
 to
 0.748
 even
though
 it
 was
 predicted
 to
 be
 0.8
 in
 both
 cases.
4.2.4.
 Public-ﬁnancing-only
 counterfactual
When
 there
 is
 only
 a
 public
 insurer,
 the
 probability
 of
 treatment
 is
 simply
 given
 by
 the
 number
 of
 health
 care
 treatments
divided
 by
 the
 total
 number
 of
 individuals
 (H/10
 =
 0.5
 or
 H/10
 =
 0.8)
 and
 therefore,
 it
 is
 independent
 of
 both

 allocation

rule
 and
 the
 public
 budget.
 The
 last
 two
 rows
 of
 panel
 (a)
 in
 Table
 3
 show
 that
 the
 mean
 probability
 of
 treatment
 by
 the
public
 insurer
 is
 lower
 under
 mixed
 public
 and
 private
 ﬁnancing
 than
 when
 there
 is
 public
 ﬁnancing
 only.
 This
 is
 true
 even
for
 needs-based
 allocation
 treatments
 under
 mixed
 ﬁnancing
 in
 which
 the
 predicted
 outcome
 is
 that
 no
 one
 will
 buy
 private
health
 insurance.
 Table
 3
 panel
 (b)
 shows
 that,
 under
 needs-based
 allocation,
 when
 B
 =
 430
 and
 H
 =
 8
 and
 when
 B
 =
 720
for
 both
 H
 =
 8
 and
 H
 =
 5,
 the
 predicted
 probability
 of
 public
 treatment
 is
 consistent
 with
 zero
 private
 insurance
 contracts
being
 purchased.
 Rearranging
 the
 identity
 given
 above
 for
 
 to
 get
 Nr =
 (H
 −
 10)/(1
 −
 ),
 we
 can
 substitute
 in
 the
 observed
probabilities
 of
 public
 treatment
 to
 calculate
 the
 mean
 observed
 number
 of
 private
 contracts
 over
 the
 30
 periods.
 Even
though
 the
 prediction
 is
 that
 no
 one
 will
 purchase
 private
 insurance,
 on
 average
 3.38,
 2.06
 and
 2.48
 private
 contracts
 are
sold
 under
 the
 three
 treatments
 mentioned
 above,
 respectively.
4.3.
 Severity
 levels
 and
 health
 care
 treatment
 status
Columns
 1–3
 in
 Table
 4
 present
 the
 mean
 severity
 for
 individuals
 treated
 publicly,
 treated
 privately,
 and
 who
 received
 no
treatment
 for
 each
 combination
 of
 public
 budget,
 health
 care
 resource
 endowment,
 and
 allocation
 rule,
 under
 mixed
 private
and
 public
 ﬁnancing.
 The
 results
 in
 Table
 4
 are
 consistent
 with
 the
 theoretical
 predictions
 outlined
 in
 Section
 2.
 Under
needs-based
 rationing,
 for
 each
 of
 the
 four
 combinations
 of
 exogenous
 treatment
 variables,
 the
 average
 severity
 levels
 are
statistically
 different
 from
 each
 other
 and
 the
 rank
 ordering
 of
 average
 severity
 levels
 is
 public
 treatment,
 private
 treatment
and
 no
 treatment
 (all
 p-values
 <
 0.05).
 For
 example,
 in
 sessions
 with
 H
 =
 5
 and
 B
 =
 430,
 the
 respective
 values
 are
 0.854,
 0.490,
and
 0.423.
 However,
 under
 random
 rationing,
 for
 two
 combinations
 of
 the
 exogenous
 treatment
 variables
 (B
 =
 430,
 H
 =
 8
 and
B
 =
 720,
 H
 =
 5)
 we
 observe
 no
 statistical
 difference
 in
 the
 severity
 levels
 of
 those
 treated
 publicly,
 those
 treated
 privately,
and
 those
 not
 treated
 (all
 p-values
 >
 0.25).
 In
 each
 case,
 the
 mean
 severity
 level
 is
 close
 to
 the
 model’s
 prediction
 of
 0.505.
For
 the
 other
 two
 treatment
 combinations,
 the
 differences
 by
 treatment
 status
 are
 statistically
 signiﬁcant,
 but
 again
 they
clearly
 cluster
 around
 0.505
 as
 predicted
 (all
 p-values
 <
 0.05).
 We  also
 observe
 the
 expected
 effects
 of
 changes
 in
 the
 supply
of
 the
 health
 care
 resource
 and
 of
 changes
 in
 the
 public
 budget.
 An
 increase
 in
 the
 supply
 of
 the
 health
 care
 resource
 under
needs-based
 allocation
 reduces
 the
 average
 severity
 of
 those
 treated
 publicly
 (e.g.,
 from
 0.807
 to
 0.622
 when
 H
 changes
 from
5
 to
 8
 and
 the
 public
 budget
 is
 L$720)
 and,
 as
 expected,
 under
 random
 allocation
 it
 has
 no
 impact.
4.3.1.
 Public-ﬁnancing-only
 counterfactual
Columns
 4
 and
 5
 in
 Table
 4
 present
 the
 mean
 severities
 for
 those
 treated
 and
 those
 not
 treated
 under
 public
 only
 ﬁnancing.
The
 most
 striking
 ﬁnding
 is
 the
 large
 difference
 between
 the
 severities
 of
 those
 left
 untreated
 with
 needs-based
 allocation
under
 public-only
 ﬁnance
 (which
 is
 0.209
 on
 average
 from
 column
 5)
 and
 those
 left
 untreated
 under
 mixed
 ﬁnancing
 with
needs-based
 allocation
 (which
 is
 0.293
 on
 average
 from
 column
 3).
 In
 fact,
 the
 average
 severity
 level
 of
 those
 not
 treated
 is
signiﬁcantly
 higher
 under
 mixed
 private
 ﬁnancing
 than
 under
 public
 only
 ﬁnancing
 for
 all
 four
 treatment
 combinations
 of
public
 sector
 budget
 and
 health
 care
 resource
 level
 under
 needs-based
 allocation
 (all
 p-values
 <
 0.05).
 As
 predicted,
 under
random
 rationing
 there
 is
 no
 signiﬁcant
 difference
 between
 average
 severity
 levels
 of
 those
 left
 untreated
 between
 mixed
and
 public
 only
 ﬁnancing
 scenarios
 (however
 the
 difference
 is
 marginally
 signiﬁcant
 at
 the
 10
 percent
 level
 for
 the
 treatment
with
 B
 =
 720
 and
 H
 =
 8).
4.4.
 Income
 level
 and
 insurance
 status
Table
 5
 presents
 summaries
 of
 income
 for
 different
 treatment
 categories
 in
 much
 the
 same
 way
 Table
 4
 summarizes
severities.
 The
 theoretical
 model
 predicts
 the
 average
 income
 of
 those
 who
 obtain
 private
 insurance
 will
 be
 greater
 than
 the
average
 income
 of
 those
 who
 do
 not
 obtain
 private
 insurance.
 The
 results
 presented
 in
 columns
 1–3
 of
 Table
 5
 are
 consistent
with
 this
 prediction.
 For
 every
 combination
 of
 experimental
 parameters,
 the
 average
 income
 of
 those
 with
 private
 insurance
signiﬁcantly
 exceeds
 the
 average
 income
 of
 those
 without
 private
 insurance
 (all
 p-values
 <
 0.02).
 For
 example,
 with
 H
 =
 5,
B
 =
 430,
 and
 needs-based
 allocation,
 the
 average
 income
 of
 those
 treated
 privately
 (L$728)
 is
 signiﬁcantly
 higher
 than
 the
average
 income
 of
 those
 not
 treated
 (L$376).
 The
 relationship
 between
 income
 and
 willingness-to-pay
 for
 insurance
 is
investigated
 further
 in
 the
 regression
 framework
 reported
 below
 in
 Section
 4.5.
4.4.1.
 Public-ﬁnancing-only
 counterfactual
Columns
 3
 and
 5
 in
 Table
 5
 show
 that
 the
 average
 income
 level
 of
 those
 left
 untreated
 is
 lower
 under
 mixed
 private
ﬁnancing
 (L$410)
 than
 under
 public
 ﬁnancing
 only
 (L$503)
 under
 both
 rationing
 rules,
 for
 a
 mean
 income
 difference
 of
23
 percent.
 The
 mean
 untreated
 income
 level
 is
 signiﬁcantly
 lower
 under
 mixed
 private
 ﬁnancing
 for
 all
 eight
 treatment
combinations
 of
 allocation
 rule,
 public
 sector
 budget
 and
 level
 of
 health
 care
 resources
 (all
 p-values
 <
 0.05
 except
 for
 needs-
based
 allocation
 when
 B
 =
 720
 and
 H
 =
 8
 for
 which
 p
 =
 0.052).

 Regression
 analysis
 of
 individual
 willingness-to-pay
 for
 private
 insurance
We
 consistently
 observe
 individuals
 willing
 to
 pay
 more
 for
 insurance
 than
 predicted
 by
 the
 theoretical
 model
 (which
assumes
 decision-makers
 are
 risk
 neutral)
 and
 consequently,
 more
 individuals
 purchase
 private
 insurance
 than
 predicted.
 In
this
 analysis,
 we
 investigate
 the
 relationship
 between
 an
 individual’s
 risk
 attitude
 and
 willingness-to-pay
 (WTP).

is
 whether
 risk
 aversion
 can
 explain
 why
 WTP
 values
 are
 higher
 than
 predicted.
 As
 previously
 described,
 the
 risk-aversion
measure
 used
 was
 derived
 from
 a
 Holt
 and
 Laury
 (2002)
 neutrally
 framed
 lottery
 choice
 task
 that
 provides
 an
 individual
 index
of
 risk
 aversion.
 We  normalized
 the
 index
 for
 each
 individual
 so
 that
 it
 ranges
 from
 −3
 to
 +4
 in
 integer
 values
 with
 negative
values
 signifying
 risk-loving
 preferences,
 positive
 values
 signifying
 risk-averse
 preferences
 and
 a
 value
 of
 zero
 signifying
risk-neutral
 preferences.
 In
 addition,
 we
 examine
 whether
 subjects
 were
 inappropriately
 inﬂuenced
 by
 past
 severity
 draws
and
 their
 incomes.
 The
 theoretical
 model
 predicts
 WTP
 will
 be
 proportional
 to
 income
 and
 this
 proportion
 will
 be
 constant
across
 all
 incomes.
 We
 therefore
 analyze
 the
 ratio,
 WTP/Income,
 as
 our
 dependent
 variable
 in
 our
 analysis.
Table
 6
 presents
 the
 results
 from
 this
 analysis.
 Column
 1
 presents
 results
 for
 the
 entire
 sample.
 Contrary
 to
 the
 model’s
predictions,
 the
 ratio
 of
 WTP
 to
 income
 does
 vary
 with
 income.
 As
 predicted,
 WTP/Income
 is
 not
 inﬂuenced
 by
 lagged
 severity.
Finally,
 an
 individual’s
 measure
 of
 risk
 aversion
 is
 not
 systematically
 related
 to
 WTP/Income.
However,
 only
 subjects
 with
 predicted
 WTP
 close
 to
 the
 price
 margin
 have
 an
 incentive
 to
 reveal
 their
 true
 underlying
value
 for
 insurance
 (these
 are
 typically
 the
 high
 income
 subjects).
 We  therefore
 conduct
 a
 sub-group
 analysis
 only
 on
 subjects
with
 income
 of
 450
 or
 greater.21 Column
 2
 of
 Table
 6
 reports
 the
 sub-group
 analysis.
 Column
 2
 shows
 the
 allocation
 rule
 and
number
 of
 health
 care
 resources
 are
 signiﬁcant
 determinants
 of
 subject
 WTP
 while
 the
 public
 sector
 budget
 treatment
 factor
is
 not
 signiﬁcant.
 This
 likely
 reﬂects
 our
 earlier
 ﬁnding
 that
 the
 experimental
 results
 on
 market
 price
 for
 health
 resources
did
 not
 support
 the
 theoretical
 predictions
 for
 changes
 in
 public
 sector
 budget.
 Also,
 the
 allocation
 rule
 effect
 on
 WTP
 is
 only
marginally
 signiﬁcant
 with
 a
 coefﬁcient
 of
 −0.061,
 which
 is
 only
 42
 percent
 of
 its
 average
 predicted
 value
 when
 changing
from
 random
 to
 needs-based
 allocation.
 This
 smaller-than-predicted
 effect
 is
 likely
 a
 result
 of
 both
 deviations
 of
 behaviour
in
 the
 subject’s
 formation
 of
 optimal
 WTP
 (assuming
 all
 variables
 are
 known)
 and
 in
 the
 subject’s
 formation
 of
 expectations
of
 the
 relevant
 variables.22 This
 latter
 aspect
 pertains
 to
 determining
 the
 probability
 of
 public
 treatment
 based
 on
 how
 WTP

 ad
 hoc
 cutoff
 based
 on
 the
 fact
 that
 some
 treatments

 people
 purchasing
 insurance.
 Our
 ﬁndings
 are
 unchanged
 if
 the
 cutoff
 is
 moved
to
 350,
 250,
 or
 550,
 with
 the
 exception
 that,
 for
 some
 of
 these
 other
 cut-offs,
 the
 lagged
 severity
 variable
 sometimes
 becomes
 marginally
 signiﬁcant.

 in

 setting

the
 general

 effect
 of

 of
 the
 theoretical
 prediction,

values
 affect
 the
 market
 price
 of
 the
 health
 resource,
 which
 in
 turn
 affects
 how
 many
 people
 the
 public
 system
 can
 treat
with
 its
 ﬁxed
 budget.
For
 the
 sub-group
 analysis,
 two
 important
 changes
 in
 the
 results
 occur:
 income
 no
 longer
 signiﬁcantly
 affects
 WTP/Income
(consistent
 with
 the
 model’s
 prediction)
 and
 an
 individual’s
 measure
 of
 risk
 aversion
 is
 now
 signiﬁcant.
 The
 coefﬁcient
 of
0.015
 on
 the
 risk-attitude
 variable
 indicates
 that,
 on
 average,
 for
 each
 unit
 increase
 in
 the
 normalized
 Holt–Laury
 measure
for
 an
 individual,
 that
 individual’s
 WTP/Income
 will
 increase
 by
 1.5
 percent.
 Therefore,
 on
 average,
 a
 person
 with
 the
 highest
degree
 of
 risk
 aversion
 (measured
 by
 a
 scale
 value
 of
 4)
 will
 have
 a
 WTP/Income
 value
 6
 percent
 higher
 than
 a
 risk-neutral
person.
Although
 this
 effect
 of
 risk
 attitudes
 can,
 in
 part,
 explain
 some
 of
 the
 deviation
 between
 predicted
 WTP
 and
 observed
 WTP,
it
 can
 explain
 only
 a
 small
 portion
 of
 this
 discrepancy.
 One
 possible
 explanation
 for
 this
 is
 that
 risk
 attitudes
 related
 to
 health
differ
 from
 risk
 attitudes
 related
 to
 lotteries
 over
 money
 (from
 which
 our
 risk-attitude
 measures
 were
 derived).
 Health
 enters
individuals’
 utility
 functions
 both
 directly,
 and
 indirectly
 through
 income,
 so
 in
 addition
 to
 individuals
 being
 risk
 averse
 in
health
 outcomes
 (just
 as
 they
 are
 for
 many
 other
 goods),
 they
 may
 also
 be
 risk
 averse
 in
 their
 income
 generation
 that
 is
 a
function
 of
 their
 health
 (see
 Chang,
 1996
 for
 an
 explicit
 modeling
 of
 this
 type
 of
 uncertainty).
 Another
 possible
 explanation
for
 this
 discrepancy
 is
 that
 individuals
 are
 unable
 to
 properly
 calculate
 the
 expected
 losses
 under
 the
 two
 allocation
 rules
(there
 is
 much
 general
 evidence
 on
 people’s
 difﬁculty
 with
 quantitative
 reasoning,
 especially
 with
 respect
 to
 probabilities).
These
 are
 important
 issues
 to
 investigate
 in
 future
 research.
5.
 Discussion
 and
 conclusions
This
 paper
 has
 presented
 a
 novel
 approach,
 incentivized
 revealed-choice
 experiments,
 to
 investigate
 the
 impact
 of
 alter-
native
 health
 care
 ﬁnancing
 arrangements
 on
 important
 health
 system
 outcomes,
 including
 the
 equilibrium
 price
 of
 health
care
 resources
 (or
 equivalently,
 the
 price
 of
 private
 insurance),
 the
 equilibrium
 probability
 of
 treatment
 for
 those
 individ-
uals
 without
 private
 insurance,
 and
 the
 average
 severities
 and
 incomes
 of
 those
 individuals
 treated
 and
 not
 treated.
 The
results
 represent
 an
 explicit
 test
 of
 the
 predictions
 of
 a
 recent
 model
 of
 mixed
 systems
 of
 ﬁnance
 (Cuff
 et
 al.,
 2012)
 and
 more
generally
 provide
 new
 insight
 into
 a
 number
 of
 aspects
 of
 the
 mixed
 systems
 of
 ﬁnance.
The
 results
 are
 broadly
 consistent
 with
 theoretical
 predictions
 of
 Cuff
 et
 al.,
 especially
 regarding
 the
 impact
 of
 changing
the
 three
 exogenous
 treatment
 variables
 of
 concern:
 the
 public
 sector
 allocation
 rule,
 the
 supply
 of
 the
 health
 care
 resource
and
 the
 size
 of
 the
 public
 budget.
 The
 magnitudes
 of
 the
 observed
 effects,
 however,
 differ
 notably
 from
 those
 predicted
by
 the
 model.
 Overall,
 WTP
 for
 supplementary
 private
 insurance
 was
 greater
 than
 predicted,
 and
 this
 was
 particularly
 the
case
 under
 needs-based
 allocation,
 which
 led
 to
 a
 smaller-than-predicted
 difference
 in
 outcomes
 between
 needs-based
and
 random
 allocation.23 Our
 work
 demonstrates
 that
 this
 ﬁnding
 was
 not
 a
 result
 of
 high
 degrees
 of
 risk
 aversion
 (risk
aversion
 explains
 only
 a
 small
 proportion
 of
 the
 WTP
 premium
 that
 we  observe).
 The
 smaller-than-expected
 difference
between
 needs-based
 and
 random
 allocation
 presents
 a
 policy
 challenge.
 Both
 observational
 studies
 (e.g.,
 Besley
 et
 al.,
1999;
 Jofre-Bonet,
 2000;
 Johar
 et
 al.,
 2011)
 and
 the
 experimental
 study
 of
 Buckley
 et
 al.
 (2012)
 indicate
 that
 demand
 for
supplemental
 private
 insurance
 responds
 to
 access
 barriers
 in
 the
 public
 system,
 whether
 measured
 by
 wait
 lists,
 wait
 times,
or
 the
 probability
 of
 a
 long
 wait.
 Conditional
 on
 a
 given
 wait
 time,
 demand
 for
 such
 private
 insurance
 should
 be
 less
 in
 a
well-functioning
 system
 that
 prioritizes
 patients
 by
 need
 and
 treats
 them
 accordingly.
 Yet
 our
 subjects
 under-appreciated
the
 value
 to
 them
 of
 a
 well-functioning
 public
 system
 that
 prioritizes
 treatment
 on
 the
 basis
 of
 need.
 Conveying
 to
 the
general
 public
 information
 on
 performance
 within
 the
 public
 system,
 in
 terms
 of
 proper
 prioritization
 and
 the
 associated
beneﬁts,
 presents
 a
 much
 greater
 policy
 challenge
 than
 information
 on
 wait
 times
 alone.
In
 some
 treatment
 parameter
 combinations,
 the
 effect
 of
 an
 increase
 in
 the
 public
 heath
 care
 budget
 was
 actually
 the
opposite
 of
 that
 predicted.
 Because
 an
 increase
 in
 the
 public
 budget
 increases
 the
 ability
 of
 the
 public
 insurer
 to
 secure
access
 to
 health
 resources,
 increasing
 its
 ability
 to
 offer
 treatment
 to
 those
 in
 need,
 this
 should
 lead
 to
 a
 decrease
 in
 the
demand
 for
 supplemental
 private
 insurance
 (and
 therefore
 private
 sector
 demand
 for
 the
 resource)
 and,
 in
 some
 contexts,
a
 subsequent
 decrease
 in
 the
 market
 price
 of
 the
 resource.
 We  observe,
 however,
 that
 an
 increase
 in
 the
 public
 budget
 is
associated
 with
 an
 increase
 in
 the
 market
 price
 in
 all
 contexts.
 It
 appears
 that
 subjects
 failed
 to
 appreciate
 the
 implication
of
 an
 increased
 public
 budget
 for
 access
 to
 public
 care
 and,
 through
 their
 demand
 for
 private
 insurance,
 created
 a
 bidding
war
 for
 the
 resource
 between
 the
 public
 and
 private
 sectors
 that
 led
 to
 an
 eventual
 increase
 in
 input
 prices.
 This
 dynamic
 is
consistent
 with
 the
 argument
 that
 supplementary
 private
 insurance
 leads
 to
 higher
 input
 prices
 and
 therefore
 inﬂationary
pressures
 that
 can
 increase
 expenditures
 in
 the
 public
 system.
 Combined
 with
 the
 above-noted
 ﬁnding
 regarding
 the
 less-
than-expected
 difference
 between
 needs-based
 and
 random
 allocation,
 the
 observed
 behaviour
 suggests
 that
 subjects
 do
 not
fully
 recognize
 and
 understand
 the
 market
 interactions
 between
 the
 public
 and
 private
 sectors.
 This
 contrasts
 with
 the
 ﬁnding
that,
 if
 anything,
 subjects
 respond
 more
 than
 expected
 to
 an
 increase
 in
 the
 supply
 of
 the
 health
 care
 resource.
 Inferring
the
 impact
 on
 access
 of
 such
 a
 supply
 increase
 does
 not
 require
 sophisticated
 and
 subtle
 analysis
 of
 market
 interaction,
 and
subjects
 respond
 strongly
 to
 this
 change.
individuals
 with
 full
 information
 have
 lower
 than
 predicted
 WTPs.
 In
 that
 experiment,
 individuals
 calculated
 their
 WTP
 under
 uncertainty
 regarding
 the
probability
 of
 public
 treatment.
23 This
 result
 also
 conﬁrms
 that
 the
 WTP
 premium
 found
 in
 Buckley
 et
 al.
 (2012)
 was
 not
 a
 result
 of
 the
 price
 elicitation
 mechanism
 used
 in
 that
 experiment.

 First,
 individuals
 do
 not
 seem
 to

 the

 of
 a

 and
 tend
 to

 Second,
 individuals
appear
 to

 the

 of

 as
they

 to

Finally,
 the

 demonstrates
 the
 potential

 of
 laboratory-based

 in

 As

 such

 offer

 for

 for

Combined
 with

Caregivers of children with mental health disorders often report high levels of stress. Although children in the
child welfare system have high rates of mental health problems, to date, little is known about the stress ex-
perienced by foster and adoptive caregivers. The purpose of the present study was to examine diﬀerences in both
internalized (e.g., worry and guilt) and externalized (e.g., anger and resentment) caregiver strain among bio-
logical, foster and adoptive caregivers, and assess the degree to which characteristics of the caregivers and the
children in their care impact strain. Caregivers of youth under age 18 who were receiving treatment in a pub-
lically-funded mental health system completed the Caregiver Strain Questionnaire (CSQ), along with the Youth
Services Survey for Families (YSSF) which has questions about the youth’s functioning and the mental health
care he or she is receiving. A total of 1828 caregivers returned surveys that were eligible for analyses.
Generalized Estimating Equations were used examine associations between caregiver type and internalized and
externalized strain while controlling for caregiver demographics and social support, and youth demographics,
functioning, and time in treatment.
Results show that foster and adoptive caregivers reported experiencing less internalized strain than biological
caregivers. Caregiver type was not signiﬁcantly related to feelings of externalized strain. Several additional
caregiver and youth characteristics were associated with both types of strain, and caregivers with higher levels of
social support experienced less strain. Providers working with children with mental health disorders, particularly
those in the child welfare system, should assess families for caregiver strain and provide and/or facilitate sup-
ports for caregivers with high levels of stress. Finally, additional research is needed to identify which types of
interventions may be most eﬀective for alleviating caregiver strain.
1. Introduction
Caring for children with mental health problems is challenging and
many caregivers of such children report high levels of stress (Angold
et al., 1998; Brannan & Heﬂinger, 2001; Brannan, Heﬂinger, &
Bickman, 1997; Brannan, Heﬂinger, & Foster, 2003; Taylor-Richardson,
Heﬂinger, & Brown, 2006). For example, parents of children with
ADHD reported stress levels that exceed the 90th percentile of normal
parenting stress (Anastopoulos, Guevremont, Shelton, & DuPaul, 1992).
Similarly, parents of children with behavior disorders reported more
stress and more depression than parents of typically developing chil-
dren (Dumas, Wolf, Fisman, & Culligan, 1991). Unfortunately, in-
creased strain can also result in a decrease in eﬀective parenting
practices. When caregivers experience high levels of stress they may
become more demanding and less emotionally responsive to their
children (Deater‐Deckard, 1998; Ponnet et al., 2013; Rousseau et al.,
2013).
While several studies have examined the predictors of biological
caregiver’s stress, there is little research on the stress felt by foster and
adoptive caregivers. Understanding the experiences of non-biological
caregivers is especially important because foster and adoptive children
with mental health problems can be challenging population to care for.
They are more likely than foster and adoptive children without mental
health problems to experience placement disruptions (Kurtz, Gaudin,
Howing, & Wodarski, 1993; Newton, Litrownik, & Landsverk, 2000;
Pardeck, 1984) and to have negative outcomes during their transition
to adulthood (Jackson Foster et al., 2015; Kang-Yi & Adams, 2015).
Furthermore, unlike biological parents who have likely been caring for
their children since birth and thus are more likely to be aware of any
major traumatic events in their children’s lives, foster and adoptive

parents may receive very limited information about the background of
children placed in their care (Geiger, Piel, & Julien-Chinn, 2017). Thus,
any mental health or developmental problems experienced by foster or
adoptive children may come as a surprise to their caregivers, which
could heighten caregiver strain. Finally, because temperament is par-
tially heritable (Saudino, 2005), foster and adoptive parents may be
more likely to have diﬀerent temperaments than their children, which
may make it harder for them to empathize with or manage their chil-
dren’s mental health problems (Green, Braley, & Kisor, 1996). The
purpose of the present study was to examine diﬀerences in caregiver
strain experienced by adoptive, foster, and biological caregivers of
children with psychiatric disorders, in order to provide recommenda-
tions to support this population.
1.1. Type of stress
Previous research has identiﬁed several distinct but related types of
caregiver stress. During the development of the Caregiver Strain
Questionnaire, Brannan et al. (1997) provided support for distinct types
of caregiver stress and further deﬁned them. Objective caregiver strain
was identiﬁed as the observable disruptive occurrences in the car-
egiving role (e.g. interrupted personal time, ﬁnancial strain) whereas
subjective caregiver strain was identiﬁed as the feelings of strain that
the caregiver experiences. Subjective strain was further delineated as
internalized and externalized strain, the former focusing on feelings
associated with caregiving (e.g. worry, guilt, fatigue) and the latter
focusing on feelings directed at the child (e.g. anger, resentment, em-
barrassment).
1.2. Type of caregiver and type of stress
The type and amount of strain that a caregiver feels may vary based
on their relationship to the child. For instance, the limited literature on
foster parents suggests that they experience unique sources of stress,
due to their relationship with the biological parent or the welfare re-
presentative, and other administrative issues (Jones & Morrissette,
1999). However, some studies have found that foster parents’ stress
levels are signiﬁcantly lower than biological parents (Villagrana, 2010).
Additionally, while adoptive caregivers also experience unique sources
of stress including possible experiences with infertility, a stressful
screening process in order to be approved for adoption, and social
stigma (Canzi, Ranieri, Barni, & Rosnati, 2019; Lansford, Ceballo,
Abbey, & Stewart, 2001), research comparing adoptive and biological
caregivers has found that adoptive caregivers have lower stress levels
(Canzi et al., 2019; Ceballo et al., 2001). It is possible that adoptive
caregivers’ strong desire to raise a child helps buﬀer the stress asso-
ciated with the caregiving experience.
A few studies of caregiver strain have been conducted with samples
that included both foster and adoptive caregivers. When Leake et al.
(2019) surveyed 246 foster and adoptive caregivers, they found that
caregivers who believed their child needed mental health care experi-
enced more stress, while those who felt that the payments they receive
from the child welfare system were adequate experienced less stress.
Furthermore, caregivers who felt the providers they worked with were
competent in adoption issues, and knowledgeable about the impact of
trauma on child behavior, had lower stress levels (Leake, Wood, Bussey,
& Strolin-Goltzman, 2019). While Leake and colleagues did not ex-
amine stress in foster and adoptive caregivers separately, McSherry
et al. (2016), analyzed diﬀerences in parent/caregiver stress among
foster, adoptive, and biological caregivers as part of a study of the
outcomes of children placed under Care Orders in Northern Ireland. The
authors found that biological caregivers reported signiﬁcantly more
parental distress than both foster and adoptive caregivers. Furthermore,
there was a trend for adoptive caregivers to report less parental distress
than foster caregivers, but the diﬀerence was not statistically sig-
niﬁcant.
The strain felt by relative caregivers has received more attention in
the research literature. In several studies, grandparents reported feeling
less stressed than parents, possibly because they already have prior
experience raising children (Harrison, Richman, & Vittimberga, 2000;
Villagrana, 2010). However, one study found that relative caregivers
expressed feelings of objective and subjective-externalizing strain that
were similar to those experienced by biological caregivers (Heﬂinger &
Taylor-Richardson, 2004). These conﬂicting results further underscore
the need to better understand how diﬀerent types of caregivers ex-
perience stress in their caregiving role.
1.3. Other caregiver characteristics and caregiver stress
Existing literature has also brought to light factors besides a care-
giver’s familial relationship to the child that can impact caregiver’s
stress levels, such as caregiver race, and amount of social support. For
instance, white caregivers report higher levels of overall strain than
Latino caregivers (Brannan & Heﬂinger, 2006; Hinojosa, 2015), and
higher levels of objective strain in response to their children’s inter-
nalizing problems than African-American parents (Kang, Brannan, &
Heﬂinger, 2005).
These racial/ethnic diﬀerences may be due in part to diﬀerences in
the size and supportiveness of the caregivers’ social networks. One
study reported that African-American caregivers had more supportive
social networks and that they utilized their social networks more when
compared to white caregivers (Bussing et al., 2003). Additionally,
single parents report more caregiver strain than married parents as a
result of the increased pressure they feel to meet the demands of their
children singlehandedly (Anastopoulos et al., 1992; Weinraub & Wolf,
1983). When caregivers of children with emotional or conduct pro-
blems feel rejected or avoided, they are at an increased risk of losing
social support which is detrimental to coping eﬀectively with diﬃcult
children (Meltzer, Ford, Goodman, & Vostanis, 2011).
1.4. Child characteristics and caregiver stress
There is a sizeable amount of research that details how certain child
characteristics can impact the strain experienced by caregivers of
children with mental health problems. Both the severity of a child’s
mental health problems and whether he or she has symptoms of an
externalizing disorder are positively associated with caregiver strain
(Brannan & Heﬂinger, 2001; Brannan & Heﬂinger, 2006; Bussing et al.,
2003; Meltzer et al., 2011; Vaughan, Feinn, Bernard, Brereton, &
Kaufman, 2013). While caregiver strain tends to worsen over time in
response to continued behavior problems (Anastopoulos et al., 1992;
Baker, Blacher, Crnic, & Edelbrock, 2002; Baker et al., 2003), caregivers
have reported less overall strain after initiating mental health services
for their child (Accurso, Garland, Haine-Schlagel, Brookman-Frazee, &
Baker-Ericzén, 2014). It may be that once services are initiated, care-
givers expect that treatment will reduce or eliminate the child’s
symptoms, and this expectation reduces stress. Additionally, caregivers
may feel they are helping their child by enrolling them in treatment
which may reduce some internalized strain. In fact, a study by Green
et al. (2019) found that caregivers who had more self-eﬃcacy regarding
their ability to successfully advocate for their child within the mental
health service system and who felt that their involvement in their
child’s mental health treatment would be helpful, had lower levels of
stress than caregivers who had less self-eﬃcacy (Green et al., 2019).
There is also evidence to suggest that the age and gender of the child
plays a role in caregiver strain levels. For example, parents of male
children report higher caregiver strain than parents of female children
(Bussing et al., 2003). Additionally, in a large study of caregiver
burden, parents of girls with conduct disorders reported higher levels of
embarrassment than parents of boys with conduct disorder. Meanwhile,
among parents of youth with internalizing disorders, parents of boys
reported higher levels of embarrassment than parents of girls. These

ﬁndings suggest that parents feel more embarrassment when their child
has a diagnosis that is considered atypical for his or her gender (Meltzer
et al., 2011). The age of the child has also been shown to play a role in
the caregiver’s strain. Parents of younger children with mental health
problems report more burden than parents of older children (Meltzer
et al., 2011).
1.5. Goals
While previous research has investigated how caregiver and child
characteristics impact caregiver strain, there is less literature speciﬁ-
cally on how the caregiver’s relationship to the child (particularly as an
adoptive or foster parent) can aﬀect their stress levels. We identiﬁed
only one prior study of caregiver stress that included, biological, foster,
and adoptive parents (McSherry, Malet, & Weatherall, 2016), and this
study did not control for other child or caregiver characteristics when
examining diﬀerences in parental distress. Our study extends prior re-
search by including caregiver type in a multivariate model. The ob-
jective of the current study was to examine the stress experienced by
biological, adoptive, and foster parents whose children were receiving
treatment in a large public mental health service system, while con-
trolling for caregiver and child characteristics that are associated with
caregiver stress.
2. Data and methods
2.1. Study background
This study was part of a larger evaluation of the quality of care
provided to children receiving publicly-funded mental health services
through 90 programs in a large county in Southern California. Each
year, caregivers are asked to complete the Youth Services Survey for
Families (YSSF; Riley, Stromberg, & Clark, 2005) if their child received
outpatient, case management or day treatment services during a two-
week survey period. The mental health programs are required by the
California Department of Health Care Services to administer the YSSF.
In 2015, an independent research team including authors (KFK and
EVT), received permission from the county’s Behavioral Health Services
administration to add supplemental questions about caregiver strain to
the YSSF survey packet. The survey packets were returned to the service
providers in sealed envelopes that were then sent to the research team.
The surveys included the child’s mental health service identiﬁcation
number but did not include child or caregiver names or addresses.
2.2. Participants
A total of 3438 caregivers were eligible for the May 2015 survey
packet, and 1985 (58%) returned at least partially completed surveys.
This completion rate is common for the YSSF in this county. We ex-
cluded 20 caregivers whose youth were 18 and older, and 137 care-
givers whose child was not living with them at the time of the survey.
Our ﬁnal data set included data from 1828 caregivers. Use of these data
for secondary analysis was approved by the University of California,
San Diego Institutional Review Board and the county’s Behavioral
Health Services administration.
Demographic information for the caregivers is shown in Table 1.
The majority of caregivers were Hispanic (reﬂecting the population of
children receiving publically-funded mental health services) (58%),
ages 45 or younger (69%), and female (82%). Approximately half of the
caregivers reported being single (52%). Three-quarters of the partici-
pants were biological caregivers, 10% were adoptive, 5% were foster
parents, and 11% reported their relationship to the child as “other”.
“Other” relationships included step-parents and relatives who may have
been unoﬃcially raising the child. The majority of caregivers had more
than one child living in their household (75%).
Among the foster and adoptive parents, approximately, 30% had
been caring for the child receiving mental health services for less than
one year. Additional information on kinship caregiving was only
available for 80% of the foster parents and 61% of the adoptive parents.
Among this sub-sample, 20% of foster parents and 47% of adoptive
parents were kinship caregivers.
Youth characteristics are shown in Table 2. Slightly more than half
(56%) were male, and the average age was 10.9 (SD = 3.96) years. The
youths’ ages ranged from under 1–17 years with a median age of 11.
More than a third (35%) were taking psychotropic medication, 24% had
a co-occurring medical condition or chronic illness, and 27% had en-
gaged in delinquent behavior in the past month. Additionally 91% had
been receiving mental health services at the outpatient agency where
the survey was conducted for less than one year.
Unfortunately, caregiver demographic information was not avail-
able for caregivers who did not complete the surveys, nor was in-
formation on youths’ psychotropic medication use, co-occuring condi-
tions or delinquent behavior. However, the demographics of the youth
in this study were similar to the entire population of clients served in

the county’s outpatient mental health system in ﬁscal year 14–15: 56%
were male, and half of the clients were ages 12–17. Our sample had
slightly more 6–11 year olds (40%) in comparison to the total client
population (33%).
2.3. Measures
The survey packet included the Youth Services Survey for Families
(YSSF; Riley et al., 2005), the Caregiver Strain Questionnaire (CSQ;
Brannan et al., 1997), and caregiver demographics. The YSSF was
created by the Children’s Indicator Workgroup within the Mental
Health Statistics Improvement Program that was run by the Center for
Mental Health Services which is part of the Substance Abuse and Mental
Health Service Administration within the U.S. Department of Health
and Human Services (Human Services Research Institute, 2004). It has
been used by several states to measure caregiver satisfaction with their
child’s mental health services, and has very good internal consistency
reliability (Riley et al., 2005) and strong convergent validity (Shafer &
Temple, 2013). The YSSF has 26 questions that are answered on a ﬁve-
point Likert scale with anchors ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5
(strongly agree). The last four questions ask about the caregiver’s social
support. The San Diego version of the YSSF is available in both English
and Spanish, and it contains youth demographic information, in-
formation about the youth’s mental health treatment, school atten-
dance, substance use, and number of arrests in the past month.
The CSQ is a widely-used measure of caregiver strain resulting from
caring for a child with mental health problems. In this study the 13-item
version was used and the focus was on two sub-scales: subjective in-
ternalized strain (feelings of sadness or guilt), and subjective ex-
ternalized strain (feelings of anger or resentment). The objective strain
scale was not included because the focus of the project was on care-
giver’s feelings of stress rather than objective diﬃculties they experi-
ence as a result of their child’s mental health problems. The questions
were answered on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = “not at all” to 5 = “very
much”) and the internal consistency reliability for the subjects in this
study was very good (α = 0.88). The CSQ has also been shown to have
good convergent validity (Brannan et al., 1997).
Questions about caregiver demographics, caregiver type, marital
status, and the number of children under 18 who were currently living
in the caregiver’s household were included in the survey packet.
Caregiver social support was operationalized as the sum of the four
social support questions on the YSSF, These questions ask if the care-
giver 1) has someone who will listen if he/she needs to talk, 2) has
someone he/she is comfortable talking to about his/her child’s mental
health problems, 3) would have support from family or friends in a
crisis, and 4) has people with whom he/she can do enjoyable things.
The youth characteristics included youth demographics, whether or not
the youth had a medical condition or chronic illness, if the youth was
currently taking psychotropic medication, and the length of time the
youth had been receiving mental health services at the survey site.
Additionally, we controlled for whether the youth had engaged in de-
linquent behavior which was deﬁned as abusing substances in the past
month, being arrested in the past month, or being absent from school
three or more days in the past month.
2.4. Analysis
Due to concerns about data being nested among the 90 county
programs where clients received the survey packets, intraclass coeﬃ-
cients (ICCs) were calculated for the CSQ scales. The number of clients
with valid survey data per program ranged from 1 to 100, with an
average of 20.3. The ICC’s were 0.057 for the subjective externalized
strain scale and 0.124 for subjective internalized strain scale. This in-
dicates that the CSQ scales were correlated among clients within each
program. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) analyses were uti-
lized because this approach eﬀectively accounts for the correlated
nature of this data (Liang & Zeger, 1986). The analyses examined the
relationship between caregiver type and subjective internalized and
externalized strain while controlling for caregiver demographics and
social support, and youth characteristics. Two GEE’s were conducted,
one with subjective externalized strain as the outcome and one with
subjective internalized strain as the outcome. The models included all
of the variables listed in the measures section of this paper. We did not
employ univariate preﬁltering (including only variables with a sig-
niﬁcant bivariate relationship with the outcome variables) or forward
or backward selection techniques because these can lead to the exclu-
sion of important control variables (Heinze & Dunkler, 2017; Pearl,
2014).
3. Results
On average, caregivers stated that they felt moderate amounts of
strain. The average score on the Subjective Internalized Strain domain
(x̅ =3.12, SD = 1.12) was higher than the average score on the
Subjective Externalized Strain (x̅ =2.16, SD = 1.06). The average
amount of strain also varied by caregiver. Biological caregivers re-
ported the highest levels of strain (Internalized Strain: x̅ =3.22,
SD = 1.11, Externalized Strain: x̅ =2.23, SD = 1.10), followed by
adoptive caregivers (Internalized
Strain: x̅ =2.93,
SD = 1.12,
Externalized Strain: x̅=2.07, SD = 1.10), other caregivers (Internalized
Strain: x̅=2.87, SD = 1.09, Externalized Strain: x̅ =2.00, SD = 0.96),
and foster caregivers (Internalized Strain: x̅=2.52, SD = 0.98,
Externalized Strain: x̅ =1.89, SD = 1.02).
Multivariate results of GEE regressions are shown in Table 3. Both
models controlled for caregiver demographic characteristics (i.e.,
caregiver age, gender, race/ethnicity, and diagnosis), youth character-
istics (i.e., youth gender, age, psychotropic medication usage, medical
condition, and engagement in delinquent behavior) and family social
support as reported by the caregiver. Biological caregivers reported
signiﬁcantly more internalized strain (e.g., more feelings of anger and
sadness) than adoptive and foster caregivers (p < 0.05). No signiﬁcant
diﬀerences were found on the Externalized Strain scale.
Other caregiver characteristics were associated with level of strain
across caregiver types. Single parents reported feeling signiﬁcantly
more internalized strain than non-single parents (p < 0.05). In com-
parison to White caregivers, Hispanic caregivers had higher levels of
internalized strain (p < .05) and Black caregivers had higher levels of
externalized strain (p < .01). Caregivers who completed the survey in
Spanish had higher levels of externalized strain (p < .05) and lower
levels of internalized strain than those who completed it in English
(p < .01). Caregivers ages 46–59 had lower levels of externalized
strain than caregivers ages 45 and under (p < .05). Additionally, male
caregivers and caregivers with greater social connectedness reported
less internalized (p < .001) and externalized strain (p < 0.05).
Caregivers of male youth reported greater externalized strain
(p < 0.05) and caregivers of older youth, youth on psychotropic
medications, and youth who engaged in delinquent behavior reported
greater internalized strain (p < 0.05). Compared to caregivers of youth
who had only one visit to the mental health treatment agency, care-
givers of youth who more than one visit but less than one month of
treatment had greater internalized strain (p < .05), and caregivers of
youth who had been in treatment between one to two months had
greater internalized (p < .05) and externalized strain (p < .01).
4. Summary and discussion
While, overall, the caregivers in this study reported experiencing
moderate levels of stress as a result of their child’s mental health pro-
blems, biological caregivers had signiﬁcantly higher levels of inter-
nalized strain than foster or adoptive parents. This result is consistent
with the ﬁndings from other studies that showed relative caregivers do
not experience as much strain as biological parents (Wang & Anderson,
K. Fawley-King, et al.

2018). While the data set did not allow for examination of relative
caregivers speciﬁcally, that many of the foster and adoptive parents in
the sample were relatives of the child they were caring for. It is possible
that in contrast with other types of caregivers, biological parents feel
personally responsible for some of their child’s mental health problems,
and these feelings of guilt contribute to higher levels of internalized
stress. Historically, therapists attributed the etiology of child mental
health problems to substandard parenting (Hinshaw, 2005). Although
this belief is no longer as prevalent among professionals, many biolo-
gical parents continue to feel that they have contributed to their child’s
mental health problems either genetically or through negative aspects
of their parenting (Moses, 2010). One study of 68 caregivers of ado-
lescents with fairly severe psychiatric disorders found that biological
parents were signiﬁcantly more likely to blame themselves for their
children’s mental health problems than adoptive or kinship parents.
Additionally, caregivers with higher levels of self-blame were sig-
niﬁcantly more likely to have symptoms of depression (Moses, 2010).
Biological parents may also feel greater levels of internalized strain
in comparison to non-biological parents because they have greater le-
vels of commitment to their children and anticipate dealing with their
child’s mental health problems for the rest of their lives. In contrast,
many foster placements are designed to be temporary, and foster par-
ents who are temporary guardians know that at some point they will no
longer be responsible for handling the child’s mental illness. While
some foster care placements and all adoptive placements are intended
to be permanent, these placement arrangements can be terminated if
they are not working. Researchers estimate that approximately 2–15%
of adoptive and guardianship placements disrupt (White, 2016).
Among biological and non-biological caregivers, single parents and
those who had less support outside the mental health system reported
greater levels of stress in relation to their children’s mental health
problems. This ﬁnding is not surprising as social support is protective
against stress (Taylor & Conger, 2017): These caregivers may have
fewer adults in their lives that can oﬀer both tangible aide and/or
emotional support to help them cope with the child’s mental health
problems.
Caregiver race, gender, and age were all signiﬁcantly related to the
reported amount of internalized and externalized strain. It appears
demographic characteristics play a signiﬁcant role in the experience of
stress in relation to children’s mental health problems. Our ﬁnding that
Hispanic caregivers reported signiﬁcantly more internalized strain
overall, but caregivers who completed the survey in Spanish reported
signiﬁcantly less internalized strain indicates that the relationship be-
tween race and ethnicity and caregiver strain may also be inﬂuenced by
acculturation as well.
Prior studies using the CSQ have not found diﬀerences between
Hispanic and White caregivers in terms of subjective strain (Brannan,
Brennan,
Sellmaier,
& Rosenzweig,
2018;

Garland, & Hough, 2003; Shin & Brown, 2009), while the ﬁndings re-
garding diﬀerences between African American and White caregivers
have been inconsistent. In two studies of youth receiving community-
based mental health services in Southern California, African American
caregivers reported lower levels of overall strain (McCabe et al., 2003;
Shin & Brown, 2009), however, a study that used a sample from another
state found no diﬀerence (Kang et al., 2005).
Youth characteristics were also signiﬁcantly related to caregiver
strain. Our results showed that caregivers of youth who may have more
severe emotional and behavioral health problems (as evidenced by need
for psychotropic medications and/or delinquent behavior) experience
greater levels of strain than other caregivers. Furthermore, caregivers of
youth who have had more than one visit but have not been in treatment
for more than a few months experience greater strain than caregivers of
youth who are just starting treatment. It is possible caregivers feel
hopeful at the beginning of their child’s treatment which may alleviate
some stress. However, treatment takes time, and if children do not have
signiﬁcant changes in their mental health in the early stages of treat-
ment this can add to the strain felt by their caregivers.
Thus, it appears levels of caregiver strain may be a function of each
caregiver’s unique situation, including not only their demographic
characteristics and cultural context, but also the characteristics of the
youth in their care and the service system where he or she receives
treatment. Additional research using structural equation modeling
could determine the interrelationships between these characteristics
and whether they mediate and/or moderate the relationship with
caregiver strain.
5. Conclusions
In order to best support caregivers of children who are receiving
mental health care, therapists should assess for caregiver strain and
provide resources to caregivers with high levels of stress. There is some
evidence that both activity restriction (lack of time for self-care and
leisure activities) and lack of self-eﬃcacy cause higher levels of stress
(Winigrove & Rickwood, 2019), therefore respite care and parent
training may both be interventions that could alleviate caregiver strain.
As social support is protective against caregiver strain, therapists could
refer caregivers to parenting support groups and/or help the caregiver
identify ways to increase their social network. Caregivers with high
amounts of strain and poor social networks may beneﬁt from referrals
to individual therapy for themselves.
Additionally, providers in the child welfare system should be aware
that biological parents may feel higher levels of internalized strain than
non-biological caregivers, and take this into account when assisting
biological families. Biological caregivers may beneﬁt from psychoedu-
cation on the etiology of their child’s mental health disorders with a
focus on possible heritability and other intrinsic pathologies. Further, if
the caregiver could beneﬁt from parenting education, the education
should be non-judgmental with an emphasis on the present and future
rather than the past in order to reduce self-blame for the child’s mental
health problems. Finally, future research is needed to identify eﬀective
ways to alleviate caregiver strain, in order to assist all types of care-
givers and the youth that they care for.

Objective: This qualitative explorative study was conducted to explore the key challenges and future
directions of caring for women with epilepsy (WWE) from the perspectives of healthcare professionals
who provide care for WWE in Palestine.
Methods: A qualitative explorative design was used in this study in adherence to the consolidated criteria
for reporting qualitative research. The study participants were interviewed in semi-structured in-depth
interviews using a pre-validated and pilot-tested interview schedule. The interpretative description
approach was used to qualitatively analyze the contents of the interviews.
Results: Interviews were conducted with 6 neurologists, 5 gynecologists, 3 psychiatrists, 5 clinical phar-
macists, and 1 internal medicine specialist. The current challenges and future directions in caring for
WWE were grouped under healthcare system-, healthcare provider-, patient-, and society-related. Lack
of adequate availability, accessibility, and affordability of neurology services and safe antiepileptic drugs
(AEDs) were the main challenges. Increasing access of WWE to specialized neurology services and
improving acceptance in the society were the main future directions.
Conclusion: Findings of this study highlighted the key challenges and future directions of caring for WWE
in a resource-poor healthcare system. Decision makers in health authorities, professional bodies, and
patient advocacy groups should consider improving availability, accessibility, and affordability of neurol-
ogy services and safe AEDs for WWE. Future studies are still needed to investigate if addressing these
challenges can improve the care of WWE in Palestine.

1. Introduction
Epilepsy is one of the most prevalent neurological diseases that
affects the lives of approximately 65 million people around the
world [1,2]. Patients with epilepsy belong to both genders, all
races, cultural groups, and socioeconomic classes [1]. Although epi-
lepsy is more prevalent among men, the prevalence of epilepsy
among women was estimated at 6.85 per 1000 women [2].
Today, it is widely accepted that being a woman with epilepsy
(WWE) is different from being a man with epilepsy because of
female-gender related issues [3,4]. These issues include hormonal
changes,
pregnancy/childbearing
potentials,
teratogenicity
of
antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), ﬁnding optimal doses of AEDs during
pregnancy/breastfeeding, interactions between AEDs and contra-
ceptives, and gender-speciﬁc stigma, among others [3,5–7]. There-
fore,
several
guidelines/recommendations were
developed
to
improve management of epilepsy in women [8,9]. Studies con-
ducted elsewhere called for improving adherence to the interna-
tional
guidelines/recommendations
while
caring
for
WWE
[10,11]. Despite these calls, several studies have shown that
healthcare professionals lacked essential knowledge of women’s
issues in epilepsy [12–15].
Palestinians receive healthcare from three main providers: the
government, the private sector, and the United Nations Relief and
Works Agency (UNRWA) for Palestine Refugees in the Near East.
Local protocols, guidelines, and policies for the diagnosis and man-
agement of patients with epilepsy in Palestine were not developed/
adopted before [16]. In routine practice, patients who experience a
ﬁrst seizure would be rushed to an emergency room/unit. After
receiving emergency/ambulatory care by internal medicine spe-
cialists,patients would be referred to neurology services. In neurol-

ogy services, patients would be examined by a neurologist who
would make a ﬁnal diagnosis based on physical/clinical examina-
tion, laboratory tests, and neuroimaging reports. It is noteworthy
that the Palestinian healthcare system is short of neurologists.
According to a recent report from the Palestinian Economic Policy
Research Institute, there were approximately 1.45 neurologists for
every 100,000 Palestinians. Therefore, patients with epilepsy have
limited access to neurology services. Patients with psychiatric
comorbidities are scheduled to see a psychiatrist. Pregnant WWE
and those with gynecological issues are referred to gynecologists.
It is worth mentioning that the majority of patients with epilepsy
in the Palestinian healthcare system are prescribed AEDs by spe-
cialists. Because some AEDs have abuse potential, general practi-
tioners are not allowed to prescribe AEDs. Eligible patients who
have valid prescriptions can obtain their monthly supplies of AEDs
at subsidized prices from the dispensaries of the Palestinian Min-
istry of Health. These dispensaries are run by qualiﬁed pharma-
cists. Dispensaries are often short
of safe AEDs for pregnant
WWE and those of childbearing age like lamotrigine and levetirac-
etam. Therefore, WWE often need to purchase these AEDs from pri-
vately owned pharmacies and pay out-of-pocket. Despite the
availability of different generics, many WWE cannot afford the
high costs of these AEDs.
Efforts to benchmark and improve healthcare delivery to
patients with epilepsy have been surmounting at a global level
[17–19]. In a previous study in Palestine, key performance indica-
tors that could be used in capturing and measuring pharmaceutical
care services for patients with epilepsy were developed [18]. In
another study, the unique challenges faced by providers of periop-
erative care to patients with epilepsy were explored [16]. Cur-
rently, little is known on what challenges provision of optimal
care for WWE in Palestine. Additionally, little is known on the
future directions that can be used to guide improving care of Pales-
tinian WWE. Therefore, this qualitative explorative study was con-
ducted to explore the key challenges and future directions of caring
for WWE from the perspectives of healthcare professionals who
provide care for WWE in Palestine.
2. Methods
2.1. Design of the study
A qualitative explorative design was used in this study in adher-
ence
to
the
COnsolidated
Criteria
for
REporting
Qualitative
Research (COREQ) checklist [20]. The study participants were
interviewed in semi-structured in-depth interviews using a pre-
validated and pilot-tested interview schedule. All interviews were
conducted in the time period between March and September 2021.
As the study was conducted during the on-going COVID-19 pan-
demic, physical distancing was practiced during the interviews.
2.2. Recruitment of the interviewees
In the Palestinian healthcare system, patients with epilepsy
including WWE often receive care from neurologists, gynecolo-
gists, psychiatrists, internal medicine specialists, and clinical phar-
macists.
Therefore,
it
was
decided
to
interview
healthcare
providers from these specialties in this study. Because being
knowledgeable of the issue being investigated is a prerequisite
for generations of rich qualitative data, a judgmental sampling
technique was used to recruit the interviewees in this study [21–
24]. The interviewees in this study were identiﬁed, invited, and
recruited using personal contacts in the ﬁeld. The following inclu-
sion criteria were used in this study: (1) having a license to prac-
tice in Palestine, (2) being in practice for at least 5 consecutive
years, (3) caring for patients with epilepsy including WWE, and
(4) providing an informed consent to participate in a recorded
interview.
2.3. The number of interviews required for this study
The number of interviews required for this study was estimated
using thematic saturation as an endpoint. Although this method
was adaptive, the number of interviews required for this study
was determined a priori. We estimated that thematic saturation
would be achieved in 10 h of interview time. Assuming a median
interview time of about 40 min, at least 15 interviews were
required to generate sufﬁcient qualitative data to saturate the
main themes and subthemes [16,22,23].
2.4. Development of interview schedule and collection of qualitative
data
The interview schedule used in this study was developed after a
preliminary search and review of the peer-reviewed literature. To
explore the perspectives of healthcare providers on the current
challenges and future directions of caring for WWE, open-ended
questions with appropriate prompts were used. The interview
schedule was reviewed for relevance by 3 researchers and health-
care providers to establish the face validity. A pilot test was con-
ducted to ensure that the interview schedule can generate
relevant qualitative data. The interview schedule is provided in
Supplementary S1. All interviews were conducted by one female
researcher (LZ) who was a student in the Master of Pharmacology
program at An-Najah National University and a practicing pharma-
cist employed by the Palestinian Ministry of Health. The principal
investigator (RS) who had experience in conducting qualitative
interviews trained the researcher (LZ) to conduct the interviews.
The researcher obtained an informed consent from each intervie-
wee. The interviewees were informed that the researchers had
no conﬂicts of interests or intentions to inﬂuence their opinions/
perspectives. All interviews were audio-recorded and ﬁeld notes
were taken. The contents of the interviews were transcribed verba-
tim. All recordings were clearly audible and there was no need to
repeat any of the interviews.
2.5. Data analysis
The transcripts were read multiple times to gain a general
understanding of their contents. The interpretative description
approach was used to qualitatively analyze the contents of the
transcripts [25]. This method was used because of its ability to
enable identifying the main themes, subthemes, and patterns.
The interpretative description approach was previously used in
analyzing qualitative data that involved complex experiences in
healthcare [16,24,26]. In addition, the Leuven Qualitative Analysis
Guide was also used to aid identifying the main themes, sub-
themes, and patterns [27]. Associations and similarities between
the qualitative data points facilitated grouping these data into
main themes, subthemes, and patterns.
2.6. Ethical issues
The international ethical guidelines and the ethical principles of
the Declaration of Helsinki were respected in this research. The
study received approval from the Institutional Review Board
(IRB) of An-Najah National University and the interviewees pro-
vided informed consents.

3. Results
3.1. Characteristics of the interviewees
A total of 20 interviews were conducted in this study. The inter-
viewees were 6 neurologists, 5 gynecologists, 3 psychiatrists, 5
clinical pharmacists, and 1 internal medicine specialist. The
sociodemographic and practice details of the interviewees are
shown in Table 1. The participants who were interviewed in this
study were trained in Palestine, Jordan, Egypt, Romania, UK, Ger-
many, Italy, Turkey, Ukraine, Russia, Tunisia, and Algeria. The inter-
viewees practiced in governmental hospitals, private hospitals,
private clinics, and clinics of the UNRWA.
3.2. Current challenges in caring for WWE
The current challenges in caring for WWE in Palestine were
grouped under healthcare system-related, healthcare provider-
related, patient-related, and society-related challenges. These chal-
lenges are summarized in Fig. 1. Representative quotations are pro-
vided in Supplementary materials.
3.2.1. Challenges related to the healthcare system
The Palestinian healthcare system lacked easily available, acces-
sible, and affordable neurology services. Therefore, patients often
needed to travel from a place to another while seeking diagnostic,
treatment, and/or care services. Similarly, new, safe, and effective
AEDs were not available, accessible, and affordable. Additionally,
specialized centers that provide services tailored to the needs of
WWE were not available.
3.2.2. Challenges related to healthcare providers
Healthcare providers in the Palestinian healthcare system
lacked understanding of the nature of epilepsy, seizures, and/or
women’s issues in epilepsy. Therefore, this could have promoted
stigma and discrimination against WWE. The Palestinian health-
care system needed a patient outreach system. There was a need
to
encourage
healthcare
providers
to
elaboratively
discuss
women’s health issues with WWE.
3.2.3. Challenges related to patients
Many WWE lacked awareness and understanding of their dis-
ease. Therefore, they were more likely to deny having the disease,
avoid seeking diagnosis or healthcare, avoid taking their AEDs,
avoid follow-up visits, and avoid disclosing/discussing their health
conditions with their healthcare providers. Therefore, they could
have ended up experiencing drug–drug interactions or have been
prescribed contraindicated drugs.
3.2.4. Challenges related to society
The Palestinian society lacked awareness and understanding of
the nature of epilepsy and seizures. As a result, patients with epi-
lepsy, notably WWE were subjects to stigma and discriminations.
Therefore, lack of acceptance of patients with epilepsy in the soci-
ety should be addressed.
3.3. Future directions in caring for WWE
Similar to the challenges, the future directions in caring for
WWE
in
Palestine
were
grouped
under
healthcare
system-
related, healthcare provider-related, patient-related, and society-
related challenges. These future directions are shown in Fig. 2. Rep-
resentative quotations are provided in Supplementary materials.
3.3.1. Directions related to healthcare system
Campaigns to increase awareness of healthcare providers on the
availability of new and safe AEDs that can be used for WWE of
childbearing age were important. Availability, accessibility, and
affordability of neurology services, and new, safe, and effective oral
AEDs should be improved. Specialized healthcare centers that cater
to the needs of WWE should be established. Female physicians
should be encouraged to specialize in neurology. Policies to elimi-

nate stigma and discrimination against patients with epilepsy,
especially WWE should be established.
3.3.2. Future directions related to healthcare providers
Campaigns to increase awareness and knowledge of healthcare
providers with regard to epilepsy and women’s issues in epilepsy
were important. A patient outreach system to remind patients
about their follow-up visits should be established and protocols/cri
teria/guidelines/policies for the diagnosis and caring for WWE
should be formally adopted. Healthcare providers should be
encouraged to elaboratively discuss women’s health issues during
clinical encounters with WWE.
3.3.3. Future directions related to patients
WWE should seek and receive education about their disease
and treatment. WWE should also be encouraged to seek health-
care, schedule periodic follow-up visits, and disclose/discuss their
health issues with their caring healthcare professionals. WWE
should be educated on the factors that could precipitate seizures
like using stimulants, electronic games, lack of enough sleep, some
drugs, and some foods. Lack of adherence of WWE to taking their
AEDs should be addressed and WWE should be encouraged to
3.3.4. Future directions related to society
Campaigns to increase awareness, acceptance, and inclusion of
WWE in the society are needed.
4. Discussion
4.1. Summary of main ﬁndings of the study
Recently, there have been many calls to improve and bench-
mark healthcare delivery in many healthcare systems around the
world [17–19]. This qualitative explorative study explored the per-
spectives of neurologists, gynecologists, clinical pharmacists, psy-
chiatrists,
and
internists
on
the
key
challenges
and
future
directions in caring for WWE in a resource-poor healthcare system.
These challenges and future directions were healthcare system-,
healthcare provider-, patient-, and society-related. Findings of this
study could be informative to decision makers in healthcare
authorities, professional groups, and patient advocacy groups
who could be interested in improving care of WWE in Palestine
and in similar resource-poor healthcare systems.
4.2. Appraisal of methods used in this study
In this study, an explorative qualitative approach was used.
Qualitative approaches are powerful in exploring perspectives of
stakeholders on a certain issue, notably, in healthcare [16,24,28].
This study was conducted and reported in adherence to the COREQ
checklist [20]. It has been argued that adherence to standard
guidelines in conducting and reporting qualitative studies can
improve transparency, reproducibility, and comparison/interpreta-
tion of the ﬁndings from different studies. Although neurologists
are the most qualiﬁed healthcare providers to care for patients
with epilepsy, like many resource-poor systems, the Palestinian
healthcare system was short with neurologists [29,30]. Therefore,
patients with epilepsy including WWE often received care from
other healthcare providers. Patients with psychiatric comorbidi-
ties, pregnant WWE, and those of childbearing age received care
from psychiatrists and gynecologists. Additionally, patients with
epilepsy receive their monthly AEDs from qualiﬁed pharmacists.
Therefore, the in-depth interviews were conducted with neurolo-
gists, gynecologists, psychiatrists, internal medicine specialists,
and clinical pharmacists. Ensuring representation of these spe-
cialties should have ensured generation of rich qualitative data to
saturate all potential themes and subthemes [3,16,18,24,31–33].
In this study, healthcare providers who interacted with WWE were
of both genders, different age groups, and had variable length of
years in practice. Additionally, the interviewees worked in differ-
ent healthcare establishments frequented by WWE in Palestine.
Moreover, the interviewees received training in different countries.
This should have enriched the qualitative data generated and ana-
lyzed in this study.
4.3. The key challenges and future directions in caring for WWE
In this study, availability, access, and affordability of neurology
services was identiﬁed as a key challenge. Many healthcare sys-
tems around the world are short of neurologists and neurology ser-
vices [34]. It has been argued that a neurologist-based model of
care for patients with epilepsy was not feasible or sustainable. In
Fig. 2. Future directions to improve caring for WWE.

such resource-poor settings, a multi-healthcare provider approach
to care for patients with epilepsy would be a realistic alternative
[18]. In this study, the participants stated that future physicians,
should be encouraged to specialize in neurology. This should
ensure alimenting the practice with future workforce of neurolo-
gists. Studies conducted elsewhere showed that caring for patients
with epilepsy was associated with high ﬁnancial costs [35,36].
Because WWE would be more at ease disclosing and discussing
their health issues with female healthcare providers, the partici-
pants stressed on the importance of increasing availability and
accessibility to female neurologists. It has been argued that
patient–healthcare provider relationship can be inﬂuenced by gen-
der [37]. Another challenge was the availability, accessibility, and
affordability of new, safe, and effective AEDs. These challenges
were previously shown in different healthcare systems in develop-
ing countries [38]. Recent guidelines recommended the use of new
safer AEDs for WWE of childbearing age [39]. Awareness, knowl-
edge, and attitudes toward epilepsy and people with epilepsy were
identiﬁed as major challenges in this study. The participants called
to increase awareness and knowledge and correct negative atti-
tudes of patients themselves, healthcare providers, and the society
at large about epilepsy and patients with epilepsy. Previous studies
conducted in Palestine reported stigma and negative attitudes
toward patients with epilepsy [14,15,28,40,41]. These negative
attitudes included refusal to marrying/befriending patients with
epilepsy. It has been suggested that awareness campaigns that
would target patients, healthcare providers, and the society at
large might improve awareness, knowledge, and might correct
negative attitudes about epilepsy and patients with epilepsy [42].
In this study, the interviewees stated that there was a need for a
patient outreach system. In Palestine, patient outreach systems
were lacking for many health conditions including hypertension
and dyslipidemia [43,44]. Reaching out to WWE and reminding
them of their follow-up visits might increase their adherence to
seeking healthcare, taking their prescribed AEDs, and discussing
their female-gender related issues. In this study, the participants
stressed on the importance of formally adopting protocols/criteria,
guidelines, and policies that would guide diagnosis and care of
patients with epilepsy. In Palestine, many protocols/criteria, guide-
lines, and policies that can aid healthcare providers diagnose and
care for patients were lacking [16,43,44].
4.4. Limitations of the study
This study is not without limitations. First, an explorative qual-
itative approach was used in this study. Compared to quantitative
approaches, qualitative approaches are limited by design and the
qualitative data collected can be regarded as opinions of the study
participants. Second, WWE were not included in this study. Con-
sidering the perspectives of patients could have added another
dimension to the perspectives of healthcare providers interviewed
in this study. Third, perspectives of nurses and midwives were not
collected in this study. Nurses and midwives provide large health-
care services to WWE in the Palestinian healthcare system. Inclu-
sion of their perspectives could have been interesting. Fourth,
perspectives of professional bodies, patient advocacy groups, and
decision makers in health authorities in Palestine were not col-
lected in this study. It would have been interesting to have the
voice of those stakeholders in this study.
5. Conclusions
In conclusion, ﬁndings of this explorative qualitative study
highlighted the key challenges for optimal healthcare of WWE in
a resource-poor healthcare system from the perspectives of neurol-
ogists, gynecologists, psychiatrists, internal medicine specialists,
and clinical pharmacists who frequently provide care for WWE.
Additionally, future perspectives of healthcare providers were also
explored. Decision makers in health authorities, professional bod-
ies, and patient advocacy groups should consider improving avail-
ability, accessibility, and affordability of neurology services and
safe AEDs for WWE. Future studies are still needed to investigate
if addressing these challenges can improve the care of WWE in
Palestine.

Objective: To analyze the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of dabiga-
tran compared with warfarin in patients with nonvalvular atrial ﬁbrilla-
tion with moderate to high risk of ischemic stroke or systemic embolism
and eligible for treatment with anticoagulants. Methods: Markov-based
economic analysis was performed to estimate treatment costs and
outcomes. Epidemiological and efﬁcacy data were determined after a
critical revision of the medical literature. Unit costs were taken from
Brazilian ofﬁcial databases. Only direct medical costs were covered.
Costs and beneﬁts were discounted at a rate of 5% per year. Outcomes
were expressed as life-year (LY) and quality-adjusted life-year (QALY).
Results: Dabigatran use is cost-effective in terms of LY and QALY
considering a willingness-to-pay threshold of 3 times gross domestic
product per capita of 2010 (Brazilian real 57,048/US $24,275.74) per LY
and QALY saved in both analyzed perspectives (private and public
health care systems). Conclusions: Dabigatran use improves patient
survival and quality of life compared with warfarin. This represents
the best therapeutic option in terms of cost and effectiveness in the
prevention of ischemic stroke and systemic embolism in patients with
nonvalvular atrial ﬁbrillation.
Keywords: stroke prevention, atrial ﬁbrillation, cost-effectiveness,

Introduction
Atrial ﬁbrillation (AF) is a supraventricular arrhythmia in which
an atrial electrical activity disorder occurs, causing the atria to
lose their ability to contract, not generating atrial systole [1]. In
population studies, AF is an important risk factor for ischemic
stroke (IS), heart failure, and death [2], with a 3% to 6% annual
risk of thromboembolic complications, which is 5 to 7 times
greater than the risk in controls with a sinus rhythm [3].
The prevalence of AF is inﬂuenced by age, sex, presence of
cardiovascular disease, such as valvular disease, and risk factors
such as hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and insulin resistance
[1,4]. Brazilian data show an annual incidence below 0.1% in the
population younger than 40 years and 1.5% and 2.0% in men and
women, respectively, older than 80 years [1].
More than 20% of all ISs are attributable to AF [4], thus
representing the largest single cause and one of the most
important risk factors for the occurrence of this condition in
Brazil. The incidence of IS in patients with nonvalvular atrial
ﬁbrillation (NVAF) averages 5% per year [5].
AF is related to greater stroke severity, higher mortality, worse
functional prognosis after stroke, greater recurrence, and longer
hospital stays, resulting in larger and more signiﬁcant costs to
health care systems [6].
To reduce all these risks associated with AF, it is essential to
rationally institute an anticoagulant therapy. Currently, therapy
with vitamin K antagonists, especially warfarin, is the medication
of choice for primary and secondary stroke prevention, transient
ischemic attack, and other thromboembolic events in patients
with AF at high risk for these events. This therapy, however, has

a risk of bleeding events [7]. Therefore, there is an imminent need
to establish new anticoagulant agents that are effective, safe, and
more convenient to use.
Dabigatran etexilate is a small molecule that is rapidly
absorbed after oral administration and converted into dabigatran
acting directly by inhibiting thrombin, responsible for the con-
version of ﬁbrinogen into ﬁbrin during coagulation cascade and
preventing the development of thrombus (clot). In addition,
dabigatran has proven its efﬁcacy and safety without the need
of coagulation monitoring and dose adjustments, and does not
cause dietary restrictions for patients [8].
The objective of the present study was to determine the cost-
effectiveness and cost-utility of the use of the new oral anti-
coagulant dabigatran compared with warfarin in patients with
NVAF at risk for IS or systemic embolism and eligible for anti-
coagulant therapy.
Methods
Target Population
The modeled patient population comprised adults with NVAF at risk
for IS or systemic embolism, eligible for treatment with an anti-
coagulant on the basis of CHADS and CHADSVASc scores. The
CHADS2 score is a measure of the risk of stroke in which congestive
heart failure, hypertension, an age of 75 years, and diabetes mellitus
are each assigned 1 point and previous stroke or transient ischemic
attack is assigned 2 points; the score is calculated by summing all the
points for a given patient. The mean CHADS2 score in the model was
2.1. Of patients who entered the model, 63.6% were men aged 71
years, considering the predominant prevalence of AF in this age
group, according to population-based studies [9].
Study Perspective
This study was developed from the perspectives of the Brazilian
private health care system (Sistema de Saúde Suplementar [SSS])
and public health care system (Sistema Único de Saúde [SUS]).
Model Structure
Markov models have two components: structure and parameters.
The “structure” refers to health states represented in the model
and the possible transitions between them. The “parameters” of
the model include the probabilities assigned to transitions
between states of health.
To estimate costs and outcomes of each treatment, a Markov
model was designed to follow patients with NVAF at risk for
clinically relevant events along the natural course of the disease
until the end of their lives. This model considered patients
transition through different health states, as shown in Fig. 1.
The primary and recurrent clinical events included were IS,
hemorrhagic stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), systemic
embolism (SE), acute myocardial infarction (AMI), intracranial
hemorrhage (ICH), extracranial hemorrhage, and death. Figure 1
represents the Markov model structure with the health states
considered in the analysis.
The model was evaluated within lifetime horizon (10 years).
Costs and outcomes were discounted to the present value at a
rate
of
5%
yearly,
according
to
recommendations
of
the
Methodological Guidelines for Economic Studies Evaluation in
Health Technology Assessment, published by the Ministry of
Health [10].
Patients transition through several health states has consid-
ered relevant clinical events such as IS or ICH. Depending on the
event severity, patients may either return to the state they were
in before the event or suffer a permanent deterioration toward a
worse dependence level. In addition, patients can die as a result
of a stroke or hemorrhage, or other comorbidities. A 3-month
cycle duration was chosen because of the low probability for
patients to have more than one severe event within this period,
and it reﬂects the typical duration of temporary treatment
discontinuation due to severe hemorrhages.
The modeling analysis allows predicting clinical and eco-
nomic outcomes for a cohort of 1000 eligible patients over their
lifetime, by calculating the life-years (LYs), quality-adjusted life-
years (QALYs), and costs accumulated over this period depending
on treatment choice. LYs are calculated on the basis of average
time (in years) the patient remained alive in the model. QALY

was estimated by multiplying the time spent in each health state
and the corresponding utility for that state (where a utility of 1
denotes full health and 0 denotes death).
Comparators
The treatments considered for patients with NVAF with risk of IS
or SE were as follows.
First-line treatment
1. Dabigatran 150 mg twice a day for patients younger than 80
years and dabigatran 110 mg twice a day for patients older
than 80 years and
2. warfarin 5 mg/d.
Second-line treatment
1. Acetylsalicylic acid in monotherapy 162 mg/d within the SUS
perspective;
2. Acetylsalicylic acid 162 mg/d combined with clopidogrel 75
mg/d within the SSS perspective.
It is worth mentioning that such medicines were used as
second-line treatment because this was the Brazilian clinical
practice when the current economic analysis was carried out.
Table 1 presents ﬁrst- and second-line treatments considered
in each comparison carried out herein.
Clinical and Safety Data
The economic model was mainly based on two studies: RE-LY [11]
and Roskell’s meta-analysis [12].
The model considered the risk of events (IS, SE, TIA, ICH, and AMI)
related to the treatment with warfarin. Risks concerning the compar-
ison of warfarin with the other analyzed treatment methods (dabi-
gatran used as ﬁrst-line therapy and acetylsalicylic acid combined or
not with clopidogrel used as second-line therapy) were also applied.
The risk of each event related to the treatment with warfarin is
presented in Table 2.
Relative risks concerning the comparison of warfarin with other
analyzed treatment methods are presented in Table 3. Acetylsalicylic
acid and acetylsalicylic acid associated with clopidogrel were also
analyzed because these drugs were administered after the failure of
warfarin or dabigatran as second-line therapy. It is noteworthy that
on SUS, acetylsalicylic acid associated with clopidogrel is not
incorporated for NVAF indication; for this reason, the second-line
treatment on SUS is composed of only acetylsalicylic acid.
Probabilities to develop a permanent or temporary disability
(described as independent, moderate dependent, and totally
dependent) after an event (IS) for each treatment method are
represented in Table 4. This table also presents the probability of
mortality within up to 90 days after the event for each treatment.
The risks of fatal SE, fatal extracranial hemorrhage, and fatal
acute myocardial infarction considered in the model were 0.46%,
0.03%, and 1.11% per year, respectively [13]. This risk is the same
for both treatments (dabigatran and warfarin).
Resources Use and Treatment Costs
On a conservative basis, only direct medical costs were consid-
ered. Indirect costs related to patient productivity loss were not
included in the analysis.
Resources used for the treatment of acute events and the
follow-up of such patients after the event were deﬁned on the
basis of specialists’ opinion. Medical visits, hospitalizations,
laboratory tests, procedures, and drugs were taken into account
(for model costs, see Appendix I in Supplemental Materials found
at http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vhri.2015.02.003).
For the perspective of the private health care system, costs of
medical visits, laboratory tests, and procedures were obtained
through the Brazilian Hierarchical Classiﬁcation of Medical Pro-
cedures (Classiﬁcação Brasileira Hierarquizada de Procedimentos
Médicos) and the daily hospital stay cost was extracted from the
Programa de Estudos Avançados em Administração Hospitalar e
de Sistemas de Saúde Bulletin (PROAHSA) [14,15].
For the perspective of the public health care system, these
costs were extracted from the public Brazilian database (SIGTAP:
Sistema de Gerenciamento da Tabela de Procedimentos, Medi-
camentos e OPM do SUS) [16].
All costs were collected in 2010 (base year). Total costs were
calculated by multiplying the amount of used resources by the
unit cost of the respective resources. The costs of each event
considered in the model are given in Table 5. For price conver-
sion, from Brazilian real (R$) to US dollar (US $), the average
exchange tax published by Central Bank of Brazil, from the last 60
business days to the date of this report elaboration (October 2014)
(US $1.00 equals R$ 2.35), was used.
Drugs’ unit costs were taken from the Brazilian ofﬁcial data-
base (Câmara de Regulação do Mercado de Medicamentos),
considering the ex-factory price added by 18% of value added
tax [17]. Prices of drugs used in monthly economic models are
given in Table 6.

Sensitivity Analysis
The quantiﬁcation of uncertainty involved in the economic model
and the identiﬁcation of variables mostly affecting such uncertainty
are crucial to support decision making. A probabilistic sensitivity
analysis was carried out to validate the results of this evaluation
through the use of distributions, instead of the parameter values
used in the mathematical model, to establish the impact of
uncertainty of each parameter included in the study.
All costs included in the analyses were varied by 10%
considering gamma distributions. Beta distributions were used
for transition probabilities, as well as efﬁcacy and safety data. In
the probabilistic analysis, 1000 simulations (Monte Carlo second
order) were estimated for each perspective and for each outcome.
Results were evaluated and ranked as follows: quadrant 1
(incremental effectiveness 4 0 and incremental cost 4 0),
quadrant 2 (incremental effectiveness o 0 and incremental

Results
Cost-Effectiveness and Cost-Utility Analysis
Outcomes and total costs were calculated for a lifetime horizon
(10 years). Table 7 presents effectiveness results: LY and QALY as
well as total costs throughout the time horizon.
Cost-effectiveness results were expressed in terms of incre-
mental cost per LY and QALY gained and are also given in Table 7.
In both perspectives, analyzed results indicate that treatment
with dabigatran is associated with a total cost higher than treat-
ment with warfarin. Regarding the outcomes analyzed, dabigatran
shows gains in terms of overall survival and quality of life.
Considering a threshold equal to 3 times the gross domestic
product (GDP) per capita of 2010 per QALY gained, results indicate
that the use of dabigatran is cost-effective compared with the
treatment with warfarin (3  GDP per capita ¼ R$ 57.048) in both
perspectives evaluated [18].
Clinical results are different in both perspectives because the
second-line treatment considered is different depending on the
perspective analyzed (SUS: acetylsalicylic acid; SSS: acetylsalicylic
acid combined with clopidogrel).
Thus, dabigatran treatment has been shown to be cost-
effective compared with warfarin treatment, with better clinical
results and an additional cost justiﬁed by the beneﬁt in terms of
overall survival and quality of life provided to the patient.
Sensitivity Analysis
After varying all costs involved in the analysis by 10% by using
gamma distributions and transition probabilities, as well as
efﬁcacy and safety data by using beta distributions, the con-
ducted probabilistic sensitivity analysis has veriﬁed results found
in the base-case scenario (see Appendix II in Supplemental
Materials found at http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vhri.2015.02.003).
Within the SUS perspective, the sensitivity analysis showed that
in 9991 cases the treatment with dabigatran was more effective, with
a higher cost, than the treatment with warfarin (quadrant 1). Only in
9 cases, treatment with dabigatran was less effective, with a higher
cost, than treatment with warfarin (quadrant 2). From the results
presented, considering a threshold equal to 3 times the GDP per
capita of 2010 per LY saved, we can consider the drug cost-effective.
Within the SSS, the sensitivity analysis showed that in 9994
cases the treatment with dabigatran was more effective, with a
higher cost, than the treatment with warfarin (quadrant 1).
Only in 6 cases, treatment with dabigatran was less effective, with

a higher cost, than treatment with warfarin (quadrant 2). Consid-
ering a threshold equal to 3 times the GDP per capita of 2010 per LY
saved, we can say that dabigatran is very cost-effective.
Discussion/Conclusions
Efﬁcacy results were taken from randomized clinical trials and
systematic reviews with dabigatran and warfarin in the AF
treatment, aiming to establish the impact of different treatments
on the prevention of stroke and mortality.
Because of the chronic nature of NVAF, patients are treated on a
continuous basis for their entire lives, except for speciﬁc causes of
discontinuation. Particularly, patients who have undergone an ICH
or hemorrhagic stroke discontinue the use of anticoagulants
permanently. Patients who have undergone an extracranial hem-
orrhage may continue the treatment, discontinue the use of anti-
coagulants temporarily, or discontinue the treatment permanently.
The incidence of clinical events can lead to 1) changes in the
treatment (e.g., change in treatment or permanent or temporary
treatment discontinuation); 2) changes in a patient’s dependence
level on a caregiver owing to the stroke and ICH (independent,
moderate, or totally dependent); and 3) changes in the risk of
future events.
Within the private health care system perspective, treatment
with
dabigatran
is
cost-effective
compared
with
that
with
warfarin, considering a threshold equal to 3 times Brazil’s GDP per
capita per QALY. Within the public health care system’s perspective,
results prove that the use of dabigatran is also cost-effective in
terms of QALY gained compared with the use of warfarin.
These results were validated through the sensitivity analysis,
which points out the inexistence of a major variance in results,
even when the limit values were tested for parameters set as
important for the result of this economic evaluation.
It is important to emphasize that results shown herein are
aligned with other cost-effectiveness evaluations of dabigatran
already
performed
and
published
for
other
countries.
For
example, Kamel et al. [19] have performed a Markovian economic
decision
model
within
the
perspective
of
the
US
private
health care system by using clinical data from the RE-LY clinical
trial and concluded that the additional cost of the use of
dabigatran etexilate amounted to US $9000, resulting, therefore,
in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of US $25,000/
QALY [19]. A similar study carried out in Canada found that
the ICER of dabigatran etexilate was CAN $10,440 per QALY
versus
warfarin
as
per
the
Canadian
health
care
system
perspective [20]. A study performed to access the situation in
Sweden has concluded that dabigatran was considered cost-
effective for the Swedish health care system, and its ICER (7742
euro per QALY) was lower than the willingness-to-pay value
normally accepted in that country [21]. A study recently carried
out in Argentina has found that dabigatran is cost-effective with
Table 7 – Cost-effectiveness results.

Premises are known to be required for the elaboration of
economic evaluations and likely to have a signiﬁcant impact on
the result. Because of the lack of data about the real world,
however, such premises are required and important to develop
analyses that could help decision makers take the most assertive
decision by choosing the most cost-effective therapeutic option.
This limitation is inherent to economic evaluations and is
minimized with the application of sensitivity analysis. Among
the limitations of this study we have the extrapolation of clinical
studies data to lifetime, and the use of specialists’ opinion to
fulﬁll the lack of real-world database information on the manage-
ment of treatment’s adverse events. The model used direct costs
only, and possible variation in the results if indirect cost is to be
added can be hypothesized.
Health economic analyses are effective tools to support health
decision makers and Brazilian Uniﬁed Health System ﬁnancers to
use resources in the most effective way. The contribution of this
economic model, which has used local costs and national
medical NVAF treatment guidelines, is to aid decision makers
in the task of choosing the best drug strategy for the prevention
of stroke and SE in patients with NVAF.

Introduction: This study aimed to evaluate the costs of CRS and HIPEC and treatment of the related
postoperative complications in the public healthcare system. We also aimed to identify the risk factors
that increase the cost of CRS and HIPEC.
Materials and methods: We retrospectively evaluated 80 patients who underwent CRS and HIPEC be-
tween February 2016 and November 2018 in the Department of Surgery, University Hospital of Olomouc,
Czech Republic. Intraoperative factors and postoperative complications were assessed. The treatment
cost included the surgery, hospital stay, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, pharmaceutical charges
including medication, hospital supplies, pathology, imaging, and allied healthcare services.
Results: The postoperative morbidity rate was 50%, and the mortality rate was 2.5%. The mean length of
hospitalisation and ICU admission was 15.44 ± 8.43 and 6.15 ± 4.12 for all 80 patients and 10.73 ± 2.93
and 3.73 ± 1.32, respectively, for 40 patients without complications, and 20.15 ± 13.93 and 8.58 ± 6.92,
respectively, for 40 patients with complications. The total treatment cost reached V606,358, but the total
reimbursement was V262,931; thus, the CRS and HIPEC proﬁt margin was V-343,427. Multivariate
analysis showed that blood loss 1.000 ml (p ¼ 0.03) and grade IeV Clavien-Dindo complications
(p < 0.001) were independently associated with increased costs.
Conclusion: The Czech public health insurance system does not fully compensate for the costs of CRS and
HIPEC. Hospital losses remain the main limiting factor for further improving these procedures.
Furthermore, treatment costs increase with increasing severity of postoperative complications.

Introduction
Peritoneal surface malignancies are a heterogeneous group of
tumours. Cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and hyperthermic intraper-
itoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) are among the treatment modalities
for peritoneal carcinomatosis since the 1990s [1]. Studies have
shown the efﬁcacy of the combination of CRS and HIPEC as a
curative intent modality for selected patients with pseudomyxoma
peritonei (PMP) [2], diffuse malignant peritoneal mesothelioma
(DMPM) [3]. Promising outcomes have also been achieved in
peritoneal metastases from colorectal cancer [4], gastric cancer [5]
and ovarian cancer [6]. However, the main criticism of CRS and
HIPEC is that long-term survival is only achieved in selected cases at
the cost of challenging surgery associated with high morbidity and
mortality rates, while a combination of cytostatic treatment and
targeted biological treatment can provide comparable results in the
similar patients [7]. CRS and HIPEC require experienced specialists,
and gaining adequate surgical skills in cytoreductive procedures
and peritonectomy requires long-term training, with suggestions
that at least 140e150 procedures are required to achieve optimal

competency [8]. The indication for CRS and HIPEC vary according to
institutional protocol. As such, the extent of cytoreduction also
differs and there are marked variables in HIPEC with respect to not
only the approach (open vs. closed), but also the type of drugs used
and the duration of hyperthermia. No international standard
guideline for the use of HIPEC has been developed. In addition CRS
and HIPEC are associated with a high morbidity rate of 12%e57%
[9,10].
The Czech Republic is among the European countries where CRS
and HIPEC is less frequently performed despite a similar incidence
in peritoneal surface malignancies (GLOBOCAN). The Czech public
healthcare system is funded exclusively by the state, with private
funding limited only to certain types of operations. Cash payments
for treatment of oncological diseases, optional fees for extra ser-
vices, supplies or care by a speciﬁc surgeon/physician are forbidden.
The present study aimed to evaluate the cost of cytoreductive
surgery and the costs of postoperative complications in this Czech
public healthcare system and identify the risk factors that increase
the cost of cytoreductive surgery and HIPEC.
Material and methods
Patients
This retrospective study evaluated 80 patients with mucinous or
non-mucinous peritoneal malignancies treated with CRS and HIPEC
at the Department of Surgery, University Hospital of Olomouc,
Czech Republic between February 2016 and November 2018. This
study was conducted following the Strengthening the Reporting of
Observational Studies in Epidemiology statement [11]. Patients
with extent disease who underwent palliative resection and HIPEC
were excluded from the study.
Assessments
All patients underwent preoperative computed tomography
(CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. Gastroscopic and colono-
scopic examinations were performed to identify the primary le-
sions. Most of the surgeries were a primary radical cytoreductive
treatment. For patients with pseudomyxoma peritonei from low-
grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasm or those with ovarian car-
cinomas, relapses were also operated after prior cytoreductive
surgery in the abdominal cavity. Diagnosis was most frequently
based on biopsy during diagnostic laparoscopy. Preoperative stag-
ing also included overall patient status, the American Society of
Anesthesiologists (ASA) risk classiﬁcation, and the results of
echocardiography and spirometry examinations. Laboratory tests
included the levels of tumour markers (CEA, CA19-9, CA72-4, CA-
125).
CRS and HIPEC technique
The indication criteria for CRS and HIPEC were set based on the
guidelines established by a local clinical tumour board. The criteria
included potential for achieving complete cytoreduction, the type
of tumour, the overall patient status, and the exclusion of extrap-
eritoneal metastases. The extent of peritoneal involvement was
evaluated according to Peritoneal Cancer Index (PCI) value [12],
which was established by the surgeon at the beginning of the
laparotomy. Initially, ascites and urine catheter samples and naso-
pharyngeal and rectal swabs were taken for microbiological ex-
amination. A prophylactic dosage of antibiotics (amoxicillin/
sulbactam and metronidazole) was administered 1 h before the
surgery and, every 8 h thereafter over an additional period of 24 h.
The extent of cytoreductive surgery was according to the extent
of the peritoneal disease found during surgery, with an aim of
achieving complete cytoreduction. All procedures during the sur-
gery were performed by a single surgeon (D.K.) as supervised by
Beate Rau of Charit
e Universit€
atsmedizin (Berlin, Germany). The
completeness of cytoreduction [12] was evaluated as follows: CC0
e no visible residual tumour, CC1 e residual tumour  2.5 mm in
diameter, CC2 e residual tumour measuring 2.5 mm-2.5 cm, and
CC3 e residual tumour measuring >2.5 cm. All the anastomoses
were constructed prior to the HIPEC procedure, using the closed
method. Four drains were inserted prior to the closure of the
abdominal cavity: two drains into the upper abdominal quadrants
for inﬂow of the lavage ﬂuid, and two drains into the lesser pelvis to
outﬂow the lavage ﬂuid. HIPEC was immediately performed after
surgery for 30e90 min depending on the cytostatic used. Currently,
we routinely use cisplatin for ovarian cancer, cisplatin and doxo-
rubicin for mesothelioma, and mitomycin C for all other types of
tumour. After HIPEC, only the drain in the left lesser pelvis was
retained.
Risk factors for increased costs
The preoperative parameters included age, sex, comorbidities
according to the ASA classiﬁcation, body mass index, the number
and type of surgeries, chemotherapy prior to the cytoreduction it-
self, and the type of tumour. Intraoperative parameters included
the extent of disease through the PCI index, the extent of cytor-
eduction, number of anastomoses, operating room time (deﬁned in
this study as the time from the start of the incision to the
completion of HIPEC rather than the total length of stay inside the
operating room), blood loss, and the number of stomata. Post-
operative complications were assessed in terms of the Clavien-
Dindo classiﬁcation [13,14]. We also assessed the overall duration
length of hospitalisation and ICU admission and the mortality/
morbidity rates.
Cost evaluation
The costs were evaluated based on the analysis conducted by
the professionals of hospital's ﬁnancial department. The cost
analysis was divided into two subgroups: the ﬁrst evaluated all
demonstrable costs that can be reported within the Czech DRG
system according to the Ministry of Health guidelines, along with
separately charged supplies and services (staplers, advanced elec-
trocoagulation technologies, blood products and antibiotics, and
duration of hospitalisation and ICU admission). The second was a
calculation of all costs for one case which in an ideal scenario
without any postoperative complications would pay the true costs
to the hospital for one CRS and HIPEC. As a scenario for CRS and
HIPEC, we used a comparison of costs for CRS and HIPEC resulting
from right colon carcinoma with localised peritoneal carcinoma-
tosis, including right hemicolectomy, omentectomy, peritonectomy,
and cholecystectomy with HIPEC using mitomycin for 90 min. In an
ideal scenario, there was also a calculation of all the true personnel
costs; costs for operation; and working time of surgeon and all
operation personnel, including anaesthetist, nurses, and other staff.
For revenues, each of the DRG case was evaluated with the total
casemix value and the resulting amount of reimbursement from
the health insurance companies. These cost/revenue indicators
were correlated with the clinical data of each case.
Statistical analysis
Complications were analysed using the Chi-square test and
Fischer exact test. The Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric analysis of
variance was used to analyse the treatment cost. Perioperative

parameters and complications that predicted increased hospital
cost were identiﬁed via multivariate linear regression and via the
non-parametric Mann-Whitney and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests,
respectively. All analyses were performed using NCSS2019 (NCSS,
USA); p < 0.05 was considered signiﬁcant.
Results
Patients and surgical outcomes
The 80 patients were divided into those with (n ¼ 40) and
without (n ¼ 40) complications. The demographic characteristics of
the patients are shown in Table 1. The mean length of hospital-
isation and ICU admission was 15.44 ± 11.07 days and 6.15 ± 5.52,
respectively. The overall morbidity in our study was 50.0%. The
most frequent complications were anaemia, protracted nausea,
defect of the passage and anastomotic leakage, various types of
infections (e.g. urinary, airway), and abdominal collections. Three
patients developed an enterocutaneous ﬁstula, and ﬁve patients
exhibited signiﬁcant postoperative haemorrhage from nonsurgical
sources; all of them had to be re-operated. The overall mortality
was 2.5% (n ¼ 2). Of the two patients, one died of severe aplastic
anaemia with pancytopenia. The other patient died of pulmonary
embolism during protracted sepsis and acute renal failure.
The surgical procedure and postoperative course are detailed in
Table 2. Only the number of patients with a history of previous
surgery (2.5% vs. 15%) and mean operation time (301.33 ± 53.84 vs.
417.19 ± 59.65) differed between the patients with and without
complications. We also found statistically signiﬁcant differences in
the total length of hospitalisation (10.73 ± 2.93 vs. 20.15 ± 13.93
days) and ICU admission (3.73 ± 1.32 vs. 8.58 ± 6.92 days).
Cost analysis
The total treatment cost forall 80 patients amountedto V606,358
(230.61%), but the total reimbursement from the public insurance
company was only V262,931 (100%); hence, the total proﬁt margin
for the CRS and HIPEC procedures for the hospital was V-343,427
(130.61%) (Table 3). The median treatment cost for all patients
without complications was V 4,085.80 ± 1,111.94. Meanwhile, the
median total treatment cost for patients who developed grade I, II,
III, IV, and V complications was V3,478, V5,238 ± 1,798.45,
V9,565.79 ± 5,136.25, V14,638 ± 32.53, and V11,145 ± 5,498.46,
respectively. (Table 4). In an ideal scenario for CRS and HIPEC of right
colon carcinoma with PC and without any complications, we
calculated all the real costs per case under the economic conditions
of our region, and the total costs is approximately V12,257.40
(V1,307 for supplies; V210, drugs and antibiotics; V6,035.80, OR
time and personnel costs; V388, supplies for HIPEC; V3,252.60,
median ICU stay; and V1,064, standard ward stay).
The economic impact of the complications is analysed in Table 4.
We found a strong association between the severity of the compli-
cations and the treatment costs and the duration of hospitalisation
and ICU admission. The median total treatment cost increased as the
grade of complications increased from grade I to grade IV. The two
patients who developed Grade V complications died relatively early,
and thus, neither the cost nor the length of hospitalisation reached
similar to that for the grade IV complication group, where all the
patients survived and were discharged for home care.
Factors associated with increased treatment cost
In univariate analysis, operating time 350 min (vs. <350 min,
p < 0.001), blood loss 1.000 ml (vs. <1.000 ml, p < 0.001), and
Clavien-Dindo complication grades IeV (vs. no complication,
p < 0.001) signiﬁcantly increased treatment costs (Table 5). In the
multivariate analysis, only blood loss 1.000 ml (p ¼ 0.03) and
complications IeV (p < 0.001) were independently associated with
increased costs. More detailed analysis revealed that the operating
room time accounted for 17.7% of the cost variability and that every
additional minute increases the costs by V22.23 (p < 0.001). Blood
was another important factor, accounting for 75.8% of the cost
variability. Every additional ml of blood loss increases the costs by
V7.30 (p < 0.001). Although the number of anastomoses showed no
statistical signiﬁcance (p¼0.102), it accounted for 3.4% of the cost
variability, each anastomose increases the cost by V796.84. Com-
plications accounted for 39.8% of the cost variability, with each
complication grade increasing the cost by V1.611,48 (p < 0.001).

ﬁnancial consequences of postoperative complications following
CRS and HIPEC and its sustainability in the public insurance health
care system in Central/East Europe in the post-communist area. Our
study shows that the costs of CRS and HIPEC markedly limits any
further development and implementation of these procedures in
the Czech Republic. The total cost of surgery for the 80 patients
included in the study reached V606,358 (230.61%), whereas the
total reimbursement from health insurance companies was only
V262,931 (100%). Thus, the institution ended up with a loss of
V-343,427, and this department had to cover this sum from reve-
nues gained from other types of surgery. The ﬁnancial gap is
thus 130.61%, indicating that the reimbursement covers less than
one-half of the cost of CRS and HIPEC. The cost per case is V7,634
(100%), while the reimbursement is only V3,287 (43%) according to
the Ministry of Health guidelines in current Czech DRG system.
Currently, the real total cost for standard CRS and HIPEC is
approximately V12, 257.40. Although the amount may be high, this
total cost for CRS and HIPEC as a potential curative treatment of
advanced colic cancer is still lower compared to that for palliative
systemic chemotherapy for 6 months (cetuximab þ FOLFIRI), which
is approximately V28,846.
The post-communist healthcare systems are characterised by
limited sources and rigidity of launching any new approaches and
treatment methods. The fundamental achievements included the
free healthcare services covered in the form of public health in-
surance either directly from the state budget or re-allocating the
funds into the budgets of the public health insurance companies.
Currently, the systems are confronted with an extreme increase in

the costs of innovative treatments, particularly biological treatment
of cancer, while the revenues of the public health insurance system
are limited.
The problem is that the current Czech DRG system lacks a spe-
ciﬁc item to cover the cost of CRS and HIPEC. This system does not
know and cannot assess the cost of peritonectomy; it knows only
certain types of resection procedures that are part of cytoreduction
(e.g. intestine resection, gastrectomy, splenectomy, cholecystec-
tomy, and omentectomy). Similarly, the system is unable to esti-
mate the cost of HIPEC. The current reimbursement patterns are
based on the following codes: (1) 06011e3: major surgeries of the
large/small intestines without complications/with complications/
with life-threatening complications; (2) 06021e3: major surgeries
of the stomach/oesophagus/duodenum without complications/
with complications/with life-threatening complications; and (3)
13012e13: exenteration of the lesser pelvis with radical hysterec-
tomy without complications/with complications.
Our analysis revealed clearly countable costs with respect to the
length of hospitalisation, length of ICU admission, medication, and
medical supplies. Similar detailed calculations can be made for the
operating room costs including supplies, antibiotics, blood prod-
ucts, and speciﬁc devices for electrocoagulation and for HIPEC.
Limited results were obtained for the HR cost per surgery because
no speciﬁc codes for this type of procedure exist in the Czech
reimbursement system, making it impossible to report cases such
as peritonectomy and diaphragm stripping.
These quantiﬁed costs, however, are still multiply lower than
those covered for CRS and HIPEC procedures in other healthcare
systems. For example, in Germany, the costs per surgery reach
V21,072 while reimbursement from the insurance company is V
20,474, and thus the loss per case is only roughly V598 [16]. Further,
in Italy is similar only 38.5% of costs reimbursed [17]. Similarly,
Baratti reported an average cost per case of V36,015 [18]. Still
higher CRS and HIPEC costs have been described for the Australian
system, where Chua et al. [19] calculated the average cost per case
to be AUD55,000 for malignant mesothelioma, AUD66,000 for
colorectal carcinoma, AUD88,000 for carcinoma of the appendix,
and AUD92,000 for pseudomyxoma peritonei. The signiﬁcantly
lower costs of CRS and HIPEC in the Czech Republic should be
considered in the context of the overall economic situation, with
signiﬁcantly lower personnel costs and lower prices of energy in-
puts, among others.
However, it remains unclear how other HIPEC centres can be
established under public healthcare systems worldwide when in
our experience not even half of the costs for one operation are
reimbursed. CRS and HIPEC is an expensive treatment, as has been
established by many studies. However, in our system, the cost for
CRS and HIPEC are still lower than that for systemic treatment.
During the opening of our centre, we secured sufﬁcient ﬁnancial
and personnel resources to offer this treatment in our region under
oversight of our hospital management. We have used all the hos-
pital's resources, as well as grants of our university and the Ministry
of Health. Our cost analyses has been helpful for the Ministry of
Health to initiate a complete change of ﬁnancing under our DRG
system. Called the DRG restart, the system will commence in
2020e2023 and will already include all types of operations. Our site
serves as a reference centre for designating CRS and HIPEC costs in
the Czech Republic, thus ensuring complete ﬁnancial compensation
in the context of our healthcare system.
The high rate of morbidity of this procedure not only raises the
treatment costs, but it can also discourage the surgical team and
hospital when considering the cost effectiveness of these proced-
ures. In this study, we observed an overall morbidity and mortality
rate of 50% and 2.5%, respectively, which is comparable to that in
major centres treating patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis
[20e24]. Further, we found that postoperative complications
following CRS and HIPEC are associated with increased morbidity
rates, extended length of hospitalisation, and higher hospital costs.
The signiﬁcant predictors of increased costs were operating time
350 min, blood loss 1,000 ml, and grade I-IV Clavien-Dindo
complications.
Mizumoto et al. [20] suggested that PCI >20, operation room
time >5 h, and blood loss >2.5 l were risk factors for complications.
Casado-Adam et al. [21] also found a signiﬁcant correlation be-
tween morbidity and the histological grade, PCI, small-bowel re-
sections, colorectal anastomosis, and the number of anastomoses.
Clinically, the aim is to reduce the risk of postoperative com-
plications, and this can be achieved primarily via precise nutritional
preparation
and
pre-operative
optimisation
termed
“pre-
habilitation” [15]. A key component of prehabilitation is prescribing
exercise interventions such as aerobic exercise and speciﬁc deep
breathing techniques for optimal cardiovascular system function
and nutritional status to ultimately improve the patient's overall
condition [6,23,24].
Conclusions
The actual cost of CRS and HIPEC exceeded the reimbursed
amount from the public health insurance system by approximately
130%. The treatment costs increased with the severity of post-
operative complications. The risk factors for increased costs were
operating room time 350 min, blood loss 1,000 ml, and grade I-
IV Clavien-Dindo complications. Thus, a comprehensive review and
adjustment of the reporting patterns for CRS and HIPEC in the DRG
system are crucial for the sustainability and development of these
procedures in the Czech Republic.

Background: Little is known about the economic burden of healthcare-associated infec-
tions (HAIs) in Brazil.
Aim: To analyse the costs of hospitalization by reimbursement from the Brazilian gov-
ernment, via the Brazilian Uniﬁed Health System (SUS) afﬁliation, and direct costs in the
adult Intensive Care Unit (ICU).
Methods: The matched-pairs caseecontrol study (83 patients with HAIs and 83 without
HAIs) was performed at a referral tertiary-care teaching hospital in Brazil in January 2018.
In order to calculate the HAI costs from the perspective of the payer, the total cost for
each hospitalization was obtained through the Hospital’s Billing Sector. Direct costs were
calculated annually for 949 critical patients during 2018.
Findings: The reimbursement cost per hospitalization of patients with HAIs was 75%
(US$2721) higher than patients without HAIs (US$1553). When a patient has an HAI, in
addition to a longer length of stay (15 days), there was an extra increase (US$996) in the
reimbursement cost per hospitalization. An HAI in the ICU was associated with a total
direct cost eight times higher compared with patients who did not develop infections in
this unit, US$11,776  US$1329, respectively. The direct cost of hospitalization in the ICU
without HAI was 56.5% less than the reimbursement (US$1329  US$3052, respectively),
whereas for the patient with an HAI, the direct cost was 111.5% above the reimbursement
(US$11,776  US$5569, respectively).
Conclusion: HAIs contribute to a longer stay and an eight-fold increase in direct costs. It is
necessary to reinforce programmes that prevent HAIs in Brazilian hospitals.

Introduction
It is estimated that in high-income countries 5e10% of
patients admitted to hospital acquire at least one healthcare-
associated infection (HAI) [1] and in low- and middle-income
countries, such as Brazil, this rate may be higher by up to

50% [1,2]. The problem is even more critical in intensive care
units (ICUs), because, although they account for fewer than
10% of total beds in most hospitals, over 20% of all HAIs are
acquired in ICUs [3].
HAIs prolong the length of stay in hospitals, resulting in high
incremental costs, as well as higher mortality [1,4e9].
Data on the economic impact of infections in low- and
middle-income countries are scarce, and the analysis of
these aspects, especially in public hospitals afﬁliated to the
Brazilian Uniﬁed Health System (SUS), can contribute to the
optimization
of
care
and
better
allocation
of
ﬁnancial
resources. Hence, the objective of this study was to access
the costs of hospitalization by values of billing/reimburse-
ment attributable to the Brazilian government, via SUS
afﬁliation, by the Brazilian Healthcare Database (DATASUS)
[10,11] and length of hospitalization stay due to HAI in a
Brazilian tertiary-care public teaching hospital based on the
point prevalence survey, using matched-pairs caseecontrol.
Additionally,
direct
costs
in
the
adult
ICU
were
also
accessed.
Methods
Setting, study design and data collection
This was a matched-pairs caseecontrol study and was per-
formed at the tertiary-care teaching hospital of Uberlandia
Federal University, in Minas Gerais, Brazil, in 2018. The
caseecontrol study was based on one day point prevalence
survey that enrolled a total of 423 patients, of which 83 were
pairs (83 with HAIs and 83 without HAIs). All inpatients that
were in the respective clinics or units on the ‘matching day’ of
prevalence were invited to participate, and those who agreed
to participate in the study were included. Patients on ICUs
included in the study were hospitalized in adult, paediatric,
coronary and neonatal ICUs; non-ICU patients were those cared
for in the following wards/units: medical, paediatric, surgical,
psychiatry, infectious diseases, burns, oncology, nursery, renal
transplantation, and primary and urgent care unit. The severity
acute illness scores used among critical adult, paediatric and
neonate patients were, respectively: Simpliﬁed Acute Physi-
ology Score 3 (SAPS 3), Paediatric Risk of Mortality (PRISM) and
Score for Neonatal Acute Physiology with Perinatal Extension-II
(SNAP-PE-II). The data of mortality rate, hospital discharge and
length of stay were taken after discharge or death by system-
atic screening of patients’ charts. Prior to the study, we
obtained written approval from the Research Ethics Committee
of the Federal University of Uberlandia granted under Number
2.173.970.
Selection of cases
A case was deﬁned as those who had an HAI on the day of the
survey, diagnosed in medical records, either by the attending
physician or by the Hospital Infection Control Service physi-
cian. HAIs were deﬁned by physicians according to the Diag-
nostic Criteria for Infection Related to Health Care established
by the National Health Surveillance Agency of Brazil [12].
Patients who presented more than one episode of HAI at the
time of this research had only the ﬁrst diagnosed infection
considered.
Selection of controls
A control was selected for each case. Controls were patients
that had not yet acquired infection on the ‘matching day’ but
that could still acquire infection later in their stay. Controls
were matched by hospitalization clinic, age, sex and the
duration of risk. Regarding age, a variation of  10 years for
adults,  1 year for paediatric patients and  10 days for
neonates, concomitant with 1-week variation in gestational
age, was considered. The duration of risk was the total length
of hospitalization stay before ‘matching day’ for control
patients and before infection for case patients. The difference
between the risk duration of the control patients was  10 days
in relation to the case patients.
Calculation of reimbursement and direct cost
In
order
to
calculate
the
reimbursement,
a
paired
caseecontrol study was performed in which the total cost of
the bill for each hospitalization was obtained through the
Hospital’s Billing Sector, while considering the legislation of
the SUS, as well as the ordinances and other technical notes in
force. For the assessment of HAI costs from the perspective of
the payer, the amount of reimbursement attributable to the
Brazilian government was calculated, via SUS afﬁliation. The
ﬁnancial transfer of SUS is made through the National Health
Fund. The values included in the billing belong to DATASUS,
available by the System of Management of the Table of Pro-
cedures, Medications, Orthotics, Prostheses and Special Mate-
rials of the Uniﬁed Health System [10,11], and take into
account the patient’s diagnosis/diagnoses), according to the
International Classiﬁcation of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10)
[11]. These billings costs are equivalent to the values that the
Brazilian government reimburses the hospital. The values
obtained were incurred from the time of admission to hospital
until discharge from hospital (including ICU).
The direct costs are also called direct medical and hospital
costs [13] and are associated with healthcare, whether related
to the multidisciplinary team or to clinical support [5]. Indirect
costs (productivity losses and work absences) were not inclu-
ded. In order to calculate the direct costs, this study included
only adult ICU care-related costs by an annual direct cost sur-
vey: expenditures related to doctors, specialists and other
staff members, consumables, clinical support services and
hospital fees, which included oxygen therapy, laboratory
analysis and imaging, blood transfusion, medications, medical
and hospital supplies, depreciation of assets and ﬁxed expen-
ses in the unit (electricity and others).
The values of reimbursement and the direct costs were
measured in Brazilian Reais (R$). However, in order to allow for
broader monetary comparisons, the values in this paper are
expressed in US dollars (US$), using a conversion rate of US$ ¼
R$3.93 (26 Apr 2019) [14].
Statistical analysis
Comparisons between groups were performed using Stu-
dent’s t-test for variables with normal distribution (D’Agostino
and Lilliefors tests) and the ManneWhitney U-test for variables
with non-normal distribution. The Chi-squared and Fisher Exact
tests were used to evaluate the relationships between

qualitative variables. We used the signiﬁcance level of 5%. All
the analyses were conducted using Bioestat 5.0 software [15].
Results
We determined the length of stay and hospitalization costs
for HAI patients by matching cases and controls, based on a
selection of 83 pairs. The overall success rate of the variables
used to match the cases and controls was 83.4%. There was no
signiﬁcant difference in severity scores between ICU patient
cases versus controls: adults (62.1  6.5 vs 51.8  19.5,
respectively, P¼0.1221) by SAPS 3, paediatrics (19.0  2.8
versus 17.0  0.0, respectively, P ¼ 0.5000) by PRISM and
neonatology (21.0  5.7 versus 41.0  28.6, respectively, P ¼
0.4216) by SNAP-PE-II (data not shown).
When considering the total amount of reimbursement for
the hospitalization of the 423 patients included in the study,
US$1,207,798,
patients
with
HAIs
corresponded
to
US$495,758, i.e. 41% of the reimbursement was allocated to
19.6% (83/423) of patients (data not shown).
Matched caseecontrol study of risk factors and the reim-
bursement costs of HAIs among patients of the ICU and non-
ICU patients showed that no signiﬁcant difference was
observed in relation to the crude mortality and comorbidities
evaluated in any of the groups (Table I). However, in relation
to the use of mechanical ventilation (MV), a signiﬁcant dif-
ference was observed in the comparison of pairs among ICU
patients and a difference in relation to the use of central
venous
catheters
(CVCs)
was
observed
among
non-ICU
patients. Lengths of hospitalization and reimbursement
costs per hospitalization were higher in patients with HAIs
regardless of whether they were ICU or non-ICU patients, and
differences were statistically signiﬁcant. Reimbursement cost
per hospitalization (median (interquartile range; IQR)) for ICU
patients was US$4191 (2857e7341) and non-ICU was 1393
(498e3849)
(P<0.0001),
regardless
of
the
presence
or
absence of HAIs (data not shown). Among critically ill
patients, the median reimbursement cost per hospitalization
of HAI patients was US$6291 compared with US$3098 for
control patients (P¼0.0078). In the patients of the other
clinics, the cases had a reimbursement cost of US$2136 and
the controls, US$1003 (P¼0.0385) per hospitalization. HAIs
generate an increase in the duration of hospitalization,
expressed as median, of 18 days for ICU patients and 11 days
for non-ICU patients, with an additional reimbursement cost
for hospitalization of US$3157 and US$421, respectively.
Of the total pairs, this study reveals that the median
reimbursement cost per hospitalization of patients with HAIs
was 75% higher than patients without HAIs (cases were
US$2721 and controls US$1553, P¼0.0070) (Table II). There
were statistically signiﬁcant differences in the length of
hospitalization for bloodstream infections (BSIs), pneumonia
and urinary tract infections (UTIs). In general, the median
length of stay for patients with HAIs was 35 days, which is
signiﬁcantly longer than that of their controls of 20 days
(P¼0.0004), thus generating an additional hospitalization stay
of 15 days. The highest cost of reimbursement for hospital-
ization was, for patients with pneumonia, US$4594, followed
by ICS, at US$4400. The results showed that there was a sig-
niﬁcant difference in reimbursement cost per hospitalization
for patients with HAIs (US$2721), while for the controls the

costs were US$1553 (P¼0.0070), generating an additional
cost, expressed as median, of US$996 per hospitalization for
one single HAI patient.
In analysing the length of stay (days) and reimbursement
cost per hospitalization (US$) of HAI management according
to discharge status (survivors or non-survivors): it was found
that there was no signiﬁcant difference in length of stay, but
the median hospitalization cost was higher in non-survivor
patients (US$6759 (3263e14,628)] than in survivors (US$2277
(637e5809)) (P¼0.0021) (Table III).
Among HAIs caused by main epidemiologically important
resistance phenotypes, it was found that when infections
were caused by carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aerugi-
nosa/Acinetobacter baumannii an increase of US$5460,
expressed as median, was observed; and for carbapenem-
resistant Klebsiella pnemoniae the increase was US$5033 on
reimbursement cost per hospitalization, when compared with
the general cost of US$2721 for HAIs (Table IV).
An infection acquired in the adult ICU was associated with
a total direct cost eight times higher compared with patients
who did not develop infection during hospitalization in this
unit, US$11,776  US$1329, respectively. When pneumonia,
BSI and UTI were independently analyzed, the overall cost
(median) of each infection, although not exactly the same,
were all similar and equally high. Important differences were
observed when comparing direct costs and reimbursement by
the Brazilian government to hospitals, via SUS afﬁliation, with
a difference of up to US$6207 for each patient with an HAI.
(Table V). The direct cost of hospitalization in the ICU of an
adult without HAI is 56.5% less than the reimbursement
(US$1329  US$3052, respectively), whereas for the patient
with HAI, the direct cost was 111.5% above the reimbursement
(US$11776  US$5569, respectively).
Discussion
Overall, the results revealed that the HAI rate in inpatients
was high and increased length of stay, as well as hospital
costs. The additional hospital stays recorded here was longer

than the 12.8 days reported by Barnett et al. [16] in Australia,
the 5 days found in China [9], the 9 and 12 days found in
Argentina [17,18] and 6 days in Mexico [19]. There is a dearth of
data and evidence on the cost of reimbursing HAIs in devel-
oping countries.
The critical units/cases are widely recognized as being
expensive and increasing [20], but it remains a challenge to get
access to the cost of mainly ICU patients [5]. There is also
considerable heterogeneity between countries in the alloca-
tion of resources and distribution of critical care services [20].
While there is a signiﬁcant body of information and evidence on
the cost of these infections from developed countries, research
from developing countries in this area is scarce or unavailable
[21,22], either due to lack of standardized methodology or lack
of surveillance with good techniques [23,24]. From a payer’s
perspective, little is known about the economic burden of
hospitalization attributable to HAIs by the Brazilian Uniﬁed
Health System.
From the perspective of French public health insurance as a
payer, the study by Touat et al. [8] assessed the cost of reim-
bursement for each hospitalization, whether in a public or
private hospital, based on information extracted from the
National Hospital Discharge database, and revealed that the
cost of HAIs ranged from US$4621 to US$5278, similar to the
results found in this study. When we evaluated the reim-
bursement cost and the direct cost per hospitalization,
extremely high values were observed in patients with HAIs
when compared to those without HAIs.
Although the observed differences between reimbursement
and direct costs are quite signiﬁcant, it should be emphasized
that HAIs are considered preventable [25] and, therefore, the
data in this study should encourage hospitals to strengthen
their management of HAIs.
Despite the different methodologies, the direct costs
attributed to HAIs were lower than those revealed in USA
hospitals [21], but they were higher than costs reported in
other countries such as China [9] and India [26] and similar to
those reported by Sogayar et al. [5] in a study involving 21
Brazilian ICUs, from public and private hospitals, with the cost
of
sepsis,
expressed
as
a
median
(IQR)
of
US$9632
(4583e18,387) and by Tiwari and Rohit [27], who found an
average of US$12,570 in India. Some studies, such as the meta-
analysis by Zimlichman et al. [21] using Monte Carlo Simu-
lation, which included costs or charges, revealed that BSI is the
most expensive HAI in the USA (US$45,814), followed by
pneumonia (US$40,144). Other studies in China [9], India
[26,27] and in Brazil [5] used a methodology much like that
used in this study, where only charges related to healthcare
were calculated into the direct costs. This study noticed that
the infrastructure costs (depreciation and ﬁxed expenses) were
the least valuable in ﬁnancial representation (1.36%). Perhaps
this is the reason why most studies [5,9,26,27] do not include
these data, as they are complex to acquire and do not con-
tribute much to the ﬁnal result.
Considering the additional length of stay, our results coin-
cide with a previous study performed in another large hospital
in Minas Gerais/Brazil [22], which found 15 (11e25) days as the
median of the additional hospitalization time for patients with
HAIs. The total cost of these infections depends on the severity
of illness and the length of stay [5,25,28,29].
We observed that HAIs are associated with mortality rate
being higher, as expected, in ICU units than in non-ICU units.
The high rate of deaths in the latter group reveals that many
critical patients remain in non-critical units due to the lack of
beds in ICUs. Nevertheless, the additional costs of hospital-
ization in ICUs were seven times higher than in the non-ICU
patients.
The most frequent sites of infection were lower respiratory
tract and blood, as reported elsewhere [30,31], including in
adult ICUs [22,32]. When the type of infection was analysed,
the additional cost due to pneumonia was the most expensive
(median US$1864) and this is in accordance with the study by
Chacko et al. [26], which also incurred the largest cost dif-
ference to pneumonia (median US$1477). These differences
were also observed when direct costs were analysed. The total
annual costs for these two major infections in the USA were
US$5 billion [21]. When in this study the authors considered the
annual cost of ﬁve major HAIs (US$9.8 billion), it was found that
surgical site infections contributed the most to overall costs
(33.7%), followed by ventilator-associated pneumonia (31.6%)
and central line-associated BSI (18.9%).
Our study reinforces the need for urgent implementation/
intensiﬁcation of HAI prevention and control measures, as the
results show that patients who do not survive consume

signiﬁcantly more resources than those who survive, as also
conﬁrmed by Sogayar et al. [5].
Complicating the situation further, there has been a rapid
rise in rates of antibiotic resistance among bacterial patho-
gens recovered in hospitals and mainly in ICUs [33]. Infections
due to multi-drug-resistant pathogens are associated with
increased mortality, length of hospital stay, and hospital
costs
[34,35].
Because
these
pathogens
are
frequently
resistant to empiric antimicrobial regimens there is often a
delay in the initiation of appropriate and effective anti-
microbial therapy [36].
Mortality, length of stay and hospital costs are typically
higher in ICUs than in other wards [37], as was observed in our
results. However, the impact of costs is greater and has
received special attention from national and international
public bodies when it comes to multi-resistant infections
[8,38]. Antibiotic resistance, mainly amongst Gram-negative
bacilli, increases the burden in the ICU as measured by mor-
tality, length of stay and charges [37,39,40]. Some pathogens
are epidemiologically more important and resistant to the last
generation antibiotics, substantially increasing the expenses,
as observed in this study, in which the costs of hospitalization
were extremely high, mainly in infections associated with
carbapenem-resistant
P.
aeruginosa,
A.
baumannii
and
K. pneumoniae.
This study was carried out from the perspective of SUS, an
extremely useful piece of data for policy makers, as this system
ﬁnances 100% of health-related expenses during the patient’s
hospitalization in Brazil. In the Adult ICU, the study involved
the hospital perspective, which allowed us to see, by com-
parison, that the estimated cost from the SUS perspective
provides an estimate of the minimum cost borne by society. For
a complete understanding of the costs of HAIs, future studies
should include an assessment of productivity losses and the
fate of those patients after hospital discharge, estimating
therefore the social cost of HAIs.
Although we evaluated only one large hospital in Brazil, this
study provides an insight into the burden of the HAI problem in
a complex public hospital in Brazil, with high prevalence as
well as high crude mortality rates. This picture is threatening
the quality of healthcare in Brazilian hospitals.
In conclusion, this study provides alarming data on the
costs (reimbursement values and direct costs) involved in the
development of HAIs in hospital environments. The length of
hospitalization and the cost of reimbursement for the hos-
pitalization of patients with HAIs was 75% higher than
patients without HAIs and the direct cost was 111.5% greater
than the value of reimbursement for patients with these
infections.
It is urgently necessary to reinforce programmes that pre-
vent HAIs, and thereby reduce their economic burden, con-
sidering the current situation of a limited government budget
devoted to medical care in the country.

Abstract
In the early 1990s, DRG based hospital ﬁnancing was introduced into some hospital
districts in Finland. The 1993 state subsidy reform decentralising all hospital ﬁnancing to
municipalities, and the aim of improving productivity, were the driving forces for introducing
DRG. This study addresses the pros and cons of DRG in hospital ﬁnancing in the Finnish
health care system and puts forward several solutions to avoid potential problems. We
consider the objectives and optimal features of hospital ﬁnancing systems in the context of
the public health care system, where the public sector owns and ﬁnances hospitals. We
analyse impacts of introducing different types of DRG based hospital ﬁnancing systems,
taking into account earlier experiences in countries such as Sweden and Norway, as well as
Finnish system speciﬁc features. DRG could assist the Finnish municipalities to compare
quality, costs and prices of services between hospitals, and related cost information might
help them budget expenditure more accurately. System speciﬁc features mean that traditional
uses of DRG in hospital pricing are not feasible in Finland. But some beneﬁts of DRG could
be exploited, for instance in the controlled contracts between municipalities and hospitals.

1. Introduction
The Diagnosis Related Groups (DRG) classiﬁcation was originally developed in
the USA for the product line management of hospitals. From the hospital inpatient
data the DRG classiﬁcation system groups inpatients by principal diagnosis,
comorbidities, surgical procedures, age, sex and discharge status in order to obtain
homogenous resource groups. In hospital management systems based on DRG
resource consumption is calculated for each DRG group, reﬂecting average treat-
ment costs in that group [1,2].
Applications of DRG tend to vary between countries and hospital care systems.
DRG has been applied to health care resource allocation, hospital pricing, manage-
ment, quality control and productivity research. Growing health care expenditures
and the move to more efﬁcient hospital production in most countries have been the
driving forces behind adoption of the DRG system. Accordingly, the main focus of
DRG use has been in resource allocation and pricing [3–7].
Since the 1980s DRG based ﬁnancing has been applied in US MEDICARE as a
hospital pricing system, while in Canada, Australia and some West European
countries DRG is used for resource allocation [6]. The effects of DRG based
hospital pricing have been studied widely especially in the USA, and several
technical and incentive problems have emerged. Although average length of stay
and thus health care costs in the Medicare system initially decreased due to DRG
based pricing, several negative impacts, such as DRG-creep, patient selection and
early discharges, have been noted [8–13]. In other countries, extensive studies on
the effects of DRG based ﬁnancing systems remain relatively rare.
The application of the US studies to health care systems based largely on the
public provision of hospital services is made problematic by the numerous speciﬁc
features and objectives of the US hospital pricing systems. For instance, besides
reducing costs and increasing efﬁciency the aims of the Medicare Prospective
Payment System (PPS) include adjusting the structure of service provision and
closing inefﬁcient hospitals [8], while the pricing approaches in public systems like
those of the Nordic countries focus on equal and cost effective resource allocation.
During the 1990s, DRG-based hospital ﬁnancing systems were introduced in the
Nordic countries, particularly in Sweden, Norway and Finland. The earliest Nordic
DRG applications employed various US DRG classiﬁcations adapted to local
hospital information systems by the use of special tables for converting the Nordic
diagnosis and procedure codes to those in the clinical modiﬁcation of the 9th
revision of the International Classiﬁcation of Diseases (ICD-9-CM) applied in the
USA. In the mid 1990s, the Nordic countries launched a modiﬁed DRG system
based on the Nordic version of the ICD-10 and a new Nordic classiﬁcation of
surgical procedures introduced in 1996 [14]. The current version of the NordDRG
applies the Nordic diagnosis and procedure codes but imitates the DRG classiﬁca-
tion rules in the 12th edition of the DRG classiﬁcation issued by the US Health
Care Financing Administration (HCFA) in 1994.
In Sweden, Norway and Finland, where the ﬁnancing and ownership of hospitals
are public, the aim of using DRG based ﬁnancing is to improve the control of
H. Mikkola et al. / Health Policy 59 (2002) 37–51
39
hospital production [15,16]. This study focuses on the problems of DRG based
hospital ﬁnancing in the public health care system, and considers how to avoid
them. Using the Finnish system as an example, the study examines the speciﬁc
objectives and features of the public health care system, taking into account earlier
studies of DRG in this context [12]. The study also describes problems in DRG
based hospital ﬁnancing systems in Sweden and Norway, and discusses how the
experiences there could be applied to the Finnish system.
2. Financing hospital care in Sweden, Norway and Finland
The Nordic Health Care Systems are usually classiﬁed as tax funded systems, but
a special characteristic is that their health services are predominately ﬁnanced and
organised by counties or municipalities rather than the state. Local authorities own
the hospitals, which are partly ﬁnanced by local taxes. Physicians and other staff
work on a salary basis. However, there are some important differences in the
ﬁnancing of hospital care between Sweden, Norway and Finland. Firstly, in
Finland and Sweden the state ﬁnancing of hospital services is not based on the
activities of hospitals, whereas in Norway revenues from the state are related to
inpatient admissions. Secondly, the role of the local organisation responsible for
ﬁnancing hospital care differs. In Finland the municipalities are also responsible for
other services (primary health care, education and social services) whereas in
Sweden and Norway the counties are mainly responsible for health care. In Sweden
the counties also provide or ﬁnance other health services (primary health care,
medicines), whereas in Norway they mostly focus on specialist services (including
somatic, psychiatric and dental care),while the provision of primary care is a
municipal [16–20].
2.1. Sweden
In Sweden, the development in health care during the 1990s moved in the
direction of planned markets. A number of county councils introduced managed
care systems in which speciﬁc purchaser functions were established and separated
from the provider functions. By 1994, 14 out of 26 county councils had established
separate purchasing functions. The organisation and working methods of pur-
chasers vary across county councils. Some have focused on promoting public health
collaboration with social services and regional insurance ofﬁces, whereas others
have focused on price and volume negotiations with different providers. Some
county councils have introduced one large central council-purchasing organisation,
while others have introduced purchasing at the local level. The purchasing organisa-
tions negotiate with hospitals’ health care to establish ﬁnancial and activity
contracts. These contracts are often based on ﬁxed per-case payments, comple-
mented by price or volume ceilings and quality considerations. DRG is the most
widespread case system used in short-term somatic care. The application of DRG
and other classiﬁcation systems varies between regions and county councils. Per
H. Mikkola et al. / Health Policy 59 (2002) 37–51
40
case reimbursements for complicated cases that greatly exceed average cost per case
may be complemented by per diem payments. In those county councils that have
not introduced purchasing arrangements, per case payments are still used for
payments between hospitals and districts and between departments within hospitals
[16,20,21].
2.2. Norway
In Norway, from the 1980s on, block grants from central government to the
county councils for hospital ﬁnancing were ﬁxed annually according to a set of
criteria, such as per capita income, age composition and density of the local
population. The counties, in turn, provided their hospitals with an annual budget.
Since July 1997 the grant system has been modiﬁed, with 30% (45% from January
1998, 50% in 1999 and 50% in 2000) of the central government subsidies to the
counties being based on the average DRG based costs per inpatients treated. This
reform is expected to strengthen the incentives for the counties to stimulate activity,
which is hoped to encourage shorter hospital waiting lists and increase hospital
productivity. However, this DRG based funding functions between the counties
and state, not necessarily between the counties and hospitals; the counties are not
obligated to adopt activity based funding. In 1997, 15 out of 19 counties provision-
ally introduced the activity related grant system to fund their hospitals, while the
reminding four counties continued with ﬁxed bloc grants [19,22].
2.3. Finland
In Finland, the municipalities ﬁnance their obligations from municipal taxes,
state subsidies and user charges. State subsidies, designed to equalise economic
differences between the municipalities, are paid as a lump sum according to a
capitation formula based on demographic and socio-economic factors [18]. The
counties in Sweden and Norway are much more larger administrative units of
hospital care compared with the Finnish municipalities. The median size of the 452
municipalities is about 5000 inhabitants but the range is from about 200 to over
500 000 inhabitants in the capital.
The Finnish hospital care system is hierarchical as in the other Nordic countries.
Public specialised care is primarily provided by 20 hospital districts, which are
administratively federations of municipalities. The hospital districts own and run
the public hospitals, which are of three categories, university; central and other
municipal hospitals. University hospitals are central hospitals for their own districts
and provide tertiary level services for other districts in their catchment area. In
large urban municipalities, health centres may also produce specialised services.
Public hospitals receive almost all (90%) of their revenues for running costs from
the municipalities, the remainder coming from user charges, which are quite high
compared with other countries with public health care systems [23]. Since the state
subsidy reform of 1993, the revenues of most hospitals have depended on the
amount and prices of produced services. The hospital districts determine prices of
H. Mikkola et al. / Health Policy 59 (2002) 37–51
41
hospital services without any national guidelines. Consequently, methods and
procedures for deﬁning services and setting prices vary between districts, and the
price setting process is continually being modiﬁed. Three types of pricing are in use,
(1) average price per bed day, which varies from speciality to speciality; (2) a
combination of fee for service and average price per bed day; and (3) case based
prices.
A typical case based price normally includes all services involved in inpatient care
(e.g. X-rays, laboratory tests, surgical procedures and accommodation) required for
a ‘standard’ treatment of a ‘normal’ inpatient, deﬁned by causes or types of
treatment, e.g. childbirth. Case-based prices are increasingly used. However, pa-
tient-speciﬁc characteristics such as age are not taken into account in pricing as in
DRG-related case-based prices. Since 1997 only two hospital districts have adopted
DRG-related case based prices, though several others are planning their introduc-
tion at some future date.
Hospital prices have a limited effect as ﬁnancial incentives for hospital produc-
tion, because the public Finnish hospitals do not pursue economic proﬁt. Price
competition as a driving force is also unrealistic, because the hospital districts
operate as local monopolies and membership in the regional hospital district is
mandatory for the municipalities. While the municipalities are economically respon-
sible for their own hospital district, they seldom purchase services outside their own
district. In addition, the heterogeneity of pricing systems means that municipalities
are not able to compare like-with-like hospital services and prices, and small
municipalities in particular have no expertise to negotiate volume for hospital care
[18]. Unlike some other countries, such as Sweden, patients, too, are unable to
promote competition between hospitals, because their choice of treating hospital is
restricted. Since demand for hospital services is regulated via a system of referrals,
in some municipalities physicians can be considered as gate-keepers, but not in
large urban municipalities, such as those in the Helsinki metropolitan area, where
a considerable proportion of referrals originate from private physicians and occupa-
tional care.
Some hospital districts have piloted contract controlled budgeting where individ-
ual or group of municipalities control the hospital production in their hospital
district using detailed agreements on costs and anticipated utilisation of hospital
care. The contracts usually include estimates of the magnitude of specialised
services and their prices, or of total costs, as well as speciﬁc cost control of
specialised services in separate municipalities and incentives to restrict rising costs
e.g. via quotas or price limits [24].
3. Swedish and Norwegian experiences of DRG hospital ﬁnancing
Due to organisational differences in health care, the principles of DRG use vary
between the Nordic countries. In Sweden DRG prices are calculated according to
the costs of some speciﬁc hospitals, while nationally ﬁxed DRG weights are used in
Norway. In Sweden, price lists and limits and quotas of treated patients are ratiﬁed
H. Mikkola et al. / Health Policy 59 (2002) 37–51
42
by the county authorities. In other words, unlike Norway, Sweden has no national
DRG policy, but the tendency is to use national hospital data for DRG weights
more widely than before [19,25]. In Finland, hospital prices such as DRG prices,
other case based or operation prices, and prices per bed day, are approved by the
authorities of the hospital districts.
In the Nordic countries, most studies on technical properties of DRG and effects
of DRG based hospital ﬁnancing have been done in Sweden. In Norway, the ﬁrst
pilot study on the use of DRG in hospital ﬁnancing started in 1991 (Stykkeprisfor-
so
¨ket). It was followed in 1994 by another (Toppﬁnansiering) while the third,
ongoing trial (Insatsstyrt ﬁnansiering) was launched in 1997 [22,26]. Thus, the
number of Norwegian studies on applications of the DRG system remains quite
low. In Finland, no thorough evaluation of impacts of DRG based hospital pricing
in the health care system has been conducted.
In Sweden, DRG based hospital ﬁnancing was ﬁrst introduced in 1992 in the
county of Stockholm. The so-called Stockholm model was the ﬁrst attempt to apply
the ideas of internal markets in health care in the Nordic countries. At ﬁrst,
experiences from the Stockholm model and from the other counties which started
to use DRG based pricing were encouraging [21,25,27]. Productivity in the Stock-
holm hospitals increased by about 20% in the ﬁrst 2 years of the reform [25]. Costs
were also reduced, because the DRG prices were reduced concretely [28]. The
overall output-based reimbursement (fee for service and DRG related prices)
improved technical efﬁciency by about 10% in Swedish hospitals from 1989 to 1995
[29].
The productivity progress was a consequence of decreased average length of stay,
an increase in number of operations and faster turnover of patients [21,25]. The
decreased length of stay partly resulted from a change in the service structure due
to DRG based pricing. For instance, the lengths of orthopaedic stays almost halved
between 1990 and 1992 in Stockholm county because patients were transferred
earlier to ‘cheaper’ beds in geriatric wards or old-age homes [30]. The problem of
long waiting lists was also solved during the ﬁrst 2 years of the reform and the
quality of care was claimed to be improved due to shorter queues. Negative effects
familiar from the US Medicare system, such as DRG-creep and patient selection,
were not observed [21,25].
However, productivity progress was temporary. In Stockholm county the produc-
tivity of hospitals in 1997 approximated the level back in 1991. Queues also
reappeared and examples of DRG-creep were noted, although still at a rather low
level. Hospital productivity was assumed to have declined, because at the same time
the capacity of hospitals was not reduced. Instead the county budgets for spe-
cialised health care started to exceed due to increased numbers of surgical opera-
tions induced by the DRG based pricing. Also, the free choice of attending hospital
provided to the patients increased the costs of specialised care [25].
Moreover, evaluation studies revealed that all counties which had changed their
hospital ﬁnancing in any way had made productivity progress. In addition to
hospital ﬁnancing systems, other ongoing health care reforms and increased outpa-
tient care improved the productivity of hospitals. In fact, the most marked
H. Mikkola et al. / Health Policy 59 (2002) 37–51
43
productivity progress occurred in the county of Jo
¨nko
¨ping, which applied the
contract controlled budget system without a DRG based pricing system. The
incentives to improve productivity of hospitals in Jo
¨nko
¨ping county were based on
controlled budgets tied to the productivity of the hospitals and permission for them
to use any surplus themselves. The Jo
¨nko
¨ping county hospitals also succeeded in
acquiring patients from other counties [21].
The experiences from internal markets and the political changes in the county
councils have meant that, the notion of competition has been replaced by that of
co-operation [31,32]. However, the use of the DRG system for deﬁning output is
still accepted in Sweden, and resource distribution according to performance is
preferred [25]. The Swedish experiences show that to attain the targets of the
ﬁnancier of health care, the hospital ﬁnancing system cannot solve the problems of
cost spiralling, inefﬁciency and queues alone.
In Norway, the ﬁrst experiment with the use of DRG based hospital ﬁnancing
was a pilot project in four hospitals in 1991–1992. About 40% of the ﬁnancing of
these four hospitals was based on DRG case based prices. Productivity progress in
the pilot hospitals was not substantially better than in reference hospitals, although,
the pilot hospitals elaborated the coding of secondary diagnoses improving reliabil-
ity of patient case-mix assessment [26].
To decrease waiting lists the Norwegian government pledged in 1994 to ﬁnance
any extra hospital production due to the use of DRG case based prices, beyond a
basic level of production. Despite a decision by the Norwegian Parliament in 1995
to use DRG only to report hospital production, a hybrid ﬁnancing method based
on DRG case based prices was re-introduced in July 1997. This experiment has
continued and the share of DRG based ﬁnancing has increased year by year (50%
in 2000). Productivity and efﬁciency have risen more in hospitals with DRG based
ﬁnancing than in reference hospitals. In practice, patients have received treatment
earlier than before. However, due to the short study period, these effects may be
temporary [22].
4. DRG related prices in the Finnish health care system
The DRG system was ﬁrst promoted for hospital management in Finland in the
1980s. However, it was not introduced to any great extent in Finnish hospitals until
the mid-1990s. Case based pricing systems based on DRG were introduced by two
large southern hospital districts in 1997 and by Helsinki University Central
Hospital in 1998. Some other hospital districts are also considering the use of DRG
and its applications for pricing their services.
In the public debate on hospital ﬁnancing in Finland in the 1990s, cost control
and efﬁciency targets were discussed more widely than other health policy issues,
such as equity. In relation to DRG in hospital pricing systems, this is somewhat
understandable; as an economic incentive, the use of DRG prices in hospital
ﬁnancing in the present Finnish health care system can be considered mostly neutral
in terms of equity targets. Incentives related to DRG based hospital pricing systems
H. Mikkola et al. / Health Policy 59 (2002) 37–51
44
could have only indirect effects on equity aspects in health services. For instance,
DRG prices might increase the supply of services and thus improve their accessibil-
ity. Consequently, the discussion below on predicted effects of DRG related prices
focuses on cost control and efﬁciency targets, while equity issues are somewhat
sidelined.
As explained earlier, the Swedish and Norwegian experiences represented decen-
tralised market-based (Sweden) and centralised (Norway) methods of using DRG
for hospital ﬁnancing. Using similar DRG based hospital ﬁnancing models in
Finland would need major reforms in the health care system itself. For instance, at
least a proper purchaser-provider split and freedom of consumer choice would need
to be introduced if the ‘Stockholm model’ were to be applied, because market
models are based on competition for patients and transactions between purchaser
and provider. Moreover, in the Finnish context, market models with DRG related
prices would be worth considering only in the metropolitan area of Helsinki, the
capital, where the population base is large enough to allow competition between
hospitals [33].
On the other hand, a nationally homogenous, DRG based hospital ﬁnancing
system such as Norway’s would conﬂict with current public policy trends in
Finland. In the 1993 state subsidy reform, most decision-making powers for health
care services were transferred to the municipalities. Thus a nation-wide DRG
related ﬁnancing system would remove part of this decision-making power from the
municipalities. Moreover, a separate organisation for managing the nation-wide
DRG related prices would need to be created and the central government would
have to assume responsibility for determining how the prices were used.
However, a nation-wide DRG related hospital ﬁnancing system could allow
hospitals to be directly controlled according to the interests of the municipalities
and central authorities. For instance, by using the DRG system in price setting the
monopoly hospitals could be prevented from setting prices higher than those with
average costs; only hospitals able to produce services with lower than average costs
could charge excess prices. Moreover, if nation-wide prices formed part of the
decision making system in specialised care, they could be used to prioritise services.
Higher nation-wide prices could encourage hospitals to produce services prioritised
by the central authorities.
It is obvious that the basic structural features of the Finnish health care system
would not be changed by introducing DRG based hospital pricing. On the
contrary, the more rational starting point would be for the DRG-system to be
applied to the existing Finnish system. Thus, in addition to the experiences in the
Swedish and Norwegian systems, the health care system speciﬁc features and the
targets of municipalities and hospitals are used as a frame of reference in the
following discussion of the pros and cons of DRG in the Finnish system.
4.1. Municipalities and DRG prices
The Finnish municipalities should require hospital pricing systems to produce
accurate information on costs and outputs of hospital production in order to steer
H. Mikkola et al. / Health Policy 59 (2002) 37–51
45
the management of hospital production according to their targets. In recent years,
the major objectives for health care in Finnish municipalities have been to decrease
costs and increase efﬁciency of specialised care. DRG based prices can only be an
indirect remedy for the problem of increasing costs and inefﬁciency, because DRG
based prices generate more information on outputs and costs of hospital produc-
tion, not savings and efﬁciency itself. To decrease costs and increase efﬁciency, the
municipalities should encourage the hospitals in their own hospital district to
minimise unit costs and set limits on certain services. DRG applications could be
used as an information base for such incentives.
The municipalities may want to use pricing systems to compare hospital products
and their prices. With a view to increasing transparency of hospital operation, the
standard deﬁnitions of hospital cases in the DRG system could allow the munici-
palities to compare inpatient services and their costs and prices between hospitals.
Such comparisons may induce competition and encourage municipalities to buy
services from other hospital districts than their own. If hospitals elsewhere had
lower prices for similar services, municipalities could at least question the prices of
their local providers. However, Finnish municipalities have a strong incentive to
buy services from the hospitals of their own hospital district. Services are generally
purchased from other districts only if the hospitals of their own district do not
produce them.
Overall, the hospital pricing system should guarantee a fair allocation of costs
between municipalities within a hospital district. The increasing comparability of
services and prices should mean that services are organised and resources allocated
more fairly and rationally between the municipalities of each hospital district. Small
municipalities could particularly beneﬁt from better price comparability, because of
their lack of expertise in specialised care and the monopoly power of hospitals.
In recent years, Finnish municipalities have been plagued by a serious deﬁcit of
reliable annual budgeting and by ﬁnancial risks caused by random cost variations.
Cost information on cases using DRG-related prices may help municipalities to
budget incoming costs more accurately. Moreover, in the existing Finnish hospital
invoicing system based on a variety of pricing types, the municipalities cover the
total risk of cost variation in specialised care. A system based on prospective DRG
prices would probably reduce this ﬁnancial risk of cost variation in the small
municipalities by transferring part of the risk to hospitals. However, in this case the
DRG prices should be standardised and ﬁxed using rules accepted by both
municipalities and hospitals. Moreover, the outliner rules of the DRG system for
exceptional cases prevent all ﬁnancial risk from being transferred to the hospitals.
However, the extent of this risk smoothing would depend more on the size of the
municipal population than on the type of pricing. Recent studies on cost variations
in hospital care in Finland imply that a municipality’s population should be at least
10 000–15 000 to guarantee that the risk remains at a reasonable level. Since only
20% of Finnish municipalities fulﬁl this criterion, a hospital pricing system should
also include other mechanisms to ensure effective equalisation of ﬁnancial risks
among the small municipalities. Presently, the hospital districts cover individual
patients’ costs exceeding a ﬁxed limit of FIM 100 000–300 000 (€ 17 000–51 000),
H. Mikkola et al. / Health Policy 59 (2002) 37–51
46
which varies across districts. The recent studies also suggest that even this ceiling
for hospital charges does not guarantee the equalisation of cost risk for small
municipalities [34].
In addition to such targets as cost control and cost efﬁciency of hospital
production, it should be in the interest of the municipalities to aim at better quality
and cost effectiveness of specialised care. The existing DRG system does not
include any primary indicators for creating and controlling incentives for these
targets. However, the use of the DRG system produces output and cost informa-
tion, which can be utilised in evaluation studies [12,35,36].
The hospital districts are federations of municipalities, which vary by size and
other features. The priorities of the hospitals may thus differ between municipali-
ties, and involve somewhat incompatible targets. For instance, if a hospital is an
important employer, the municipality may be willing to pay high hospital prices in
order to maintain the hospital. However, this does not prevent the use of DRG
based prices, because municipalities can pay higher prices if they so wish.
4.2. Hospitals and DRG prices
Finnish hospitals collect their revenues by charging the municipalities, which are
also their owners. Thus a major purpose of the Finnish hospital pricing system has
been to cover the costs of production, and hospital prices are expected to reﬂect the
costs as accurately as possible. The problem of the hospitals, as well as the
municipalities, has been the lack of reliable cost predictions. Several inter-
national studies reveal that DRG reﬂects the resource consumption per patient
better than alternative systems. If DRG based prices do indeed reﬂect the costs
better than the existing management systems, hospital activities could be planned
more rationally. However, since in reality the amount of produced services and
their costs are in the hands of hospitals, they—as local monopolies—may deviate
from the municipalities in their targets. In practice, when there is a cost deﬁcit,
negotiations usually result in the municipality approving an extra budget. Using
DRG related prices, transparent cost information could be produced for both
parties.
Nevertheless, the reliable use of the DRG system for hospital invoicing requires
patient speciﬁc cost accounting. In existing cost accounting, few Finnish hospitals
have a patient speciﬁc system. Accordingly, Finnish DRG cost weights have been
calculated using only cost data from some Helsinki metropolitan area hospitals,
which are not representative of all hospitals in Finland. However, shortcomings in
hospital cost information systems have not prevented wider use of the DRG system.
In Finland, DRG has been used as an output measure in hospital productivity
studies and for benchmarking hospitals [37].
As ﬁnancial incentives DRG related prices would not necessarily offer much new
compared with the other case based prices currently applied in many Finnish
hospitals, one potential beneﬁt of DRG related prices is that patients’ speciﬁc
features, such as age and comorbidities, are taken into account, whereas case based
prices are determined without patient speciﬁc information.
H. Mikkola et al. / Health Policy 59 (2002) 37–51
47
In the 1990s, many Finnish hospitals were divided (usually according to special-
ity) into management by objectives (MBO) units responsible for their own budgets.
Their revenues depend mostly on produced services and their prices, but also on
political decisions made in their hospital districts. Thus, the MBO units of hospitals
have to take economic issues into account in their decision making. As with public
organisations generally [38], the MBO units can be assumed to seek to increase their
budgets and maximise their share of hospital revenues.
To earn more revenues for the MBO units of hospitals, DRG related prices
encourage an increase in the number of hospitalised patients as do other cased
based prices used. Without control over the numbers of patients in separate
specialities, DRG related prices might intensify the growth of operations which are
not evidently cost-efﬁcient. The DRG classiﬁcation takes surgical operations into
account more accurately than other treatments, so DRG based pricing may also
change practice patterns in hospitals in favour of surgical treatments instead of
conservative options. In Norway, the DRG based funding is used to increase the
volume of hospital services. In Finland, where the numbers of several surgical
procedures, such as hysterectomies [39] and back operations [40], have been shown
to be internationally rather high, a general boost to hospital activities is probably
not needed. Rather, a hospital pricing system in Finland should include incentives
of hospitals to increase their service provision.
The DRG system would also allow Finnish hospitals to earn more revenues by
manipulating the case-mix. As public hospitals in a health care system based on
hierarchically regionalised services, Finnish hospitals have little power to affect the
real case mix of patients, because they are not allowed to select patients. However,
the experiences in Sweden and Norway have shown that after the ﬁrst few years
physicians learn to code diagnoses and also comorbidities more accurately [26,41].
Experiences in other countries [42], where DRG is used in hospital ﬁnancing show
that, it is necessary to control coding of patient data to guarantee a fair resource
allocation between hospitals.
In recent years, growing pressures to improve cost efﬁciency in Finnish hospitals
have meant that another important objective for hospital management is to
minimise costs per case without decreasing effectiveness and quality of specialised
services. DRG based prices, like other case based prices, encourage hospitals to
contain resource consumption per case, usually by decreasing length of stay [43,44].
As in other countries in the 1990s Finnish hospitals introduced new surgical
techniques and increased operations in outpatient care, which effectively shortened
hospital stays. In addition, hospitals in some hospital districts have been encour-
aged to transfer patients earlier to cheaper post-acute care—in practice, to non-spe-
cialised health centre hospital wards and old-age homes.
In the existing hospital pricing systems the prices for different services are set
according to earlier estimated costs. However, Finnish hospitals may also set
targets other than cost recovery for pricing. They may over-or underprice some
products for cross subsidisation to other products and services. Also, special
services requiring special equipment establish a natural monopoly position for
university hospitals and, therefore, a possibility to overprice certain services. On the
H. Mikkola et al. / Health Policy 59 (2002) 37–51
48
other hand, university hospitals also produce similar services to central and other
municipal hospitals. To enhance their ability to compete for patients with other
hospitals, university hospitals may tend to underprice their standard services. A
transparent pricing system based on DRG would reduce the scope for monopoly
pricing.
To reﬁne a ‘possible’ any future Finnish system of DRG, the DRG cost weights
used for hospital pricing should be calculated using the speciﬁc groups relating to
divergent patient case mixes across hospitals in the hierarchical hospital system.
Patients in university hospitals are more heterogeneous and their cases more severe
than in other hospitals, so the DRG subgroups may also be needed to describe more
precisely the resource consumption of cases in these hospitals. In addition, outpatient
visits and post acute care, which are outside the DRG system, should be linked to
cost control mechanisms. This would make it possible to evaluate and develop the
total care process from the viewpoints of technical and allocative efﬁciency, and
quality.
5. Conclusions
Although the introduction into Finnish hospital care of a DRG based hospital
pricing system could lead to several improvements, such as better transparency and
more accurate information, it is obvious that DRG pricing systems based on principles
applied in other countries, even in Sweden and Norway, are not feasible in the Finnish
system. For instance, the centralised system applied in Norway would only work if
the state instead of the municipalities were to take more responsibility for ﬁnancing
and organising specialised care. The Swedish market model with DRG prices does
not suit the Finnish system for several reasons; in Finland the population is more
scattered, and neither a purchaser-provider split nor wider consumer choice have been
implemented. Moreover, while the introduction of DRG based hospital ﬁnancing
would require pronounced adjustments in the Health Care System, they would not
solve many present problems of hospital ﬁnancing, such as economic risks to small
municipalities.
Experiences in the other Nordic countries also support caution in the application
of DRG in hospital ﬁnancing. In Sweden the effects of the ﬁnancial reform seem to
have been only transient, because the other changes in the system did not support
the reform. Accordingly, the market based Stockholm model applying DRG prices
increased total costs, and even better productivity progress was achieved without
markets in other Swedish counties. Both in Norway and Sweden DRG based ﬁnancing
has been an effective incentive for increased productivity in terms of numbers of
patients. However, an increase in patient number is not the main current concern
of the Finnish municipalities ﬁnancing hospital services, but rather cost containment
and maintaining the quality of care. Furthermore, a common feature of the DRG
based ﬁnancing systems seems to be that, even in public systems, DRG creep and
a gradual deterioration of the validity of the classiﬁcation are potential problems that
arise—and must be dealt with—when the DRG system is used as a base for ﬁnancing.
H. Mikkola et al. / Health Policy 59 (2002) 37–51
49
However, DRG based ﬁnancing could be introduced into the Finnish hospital
system if DRG were able to provide more data on hospital production and its costs
than present management systems. As an information source, DRG prices could be
used to predict and control production costs, to encourage cost-efﬁcient operations
and to reinforce the position of the municipalities in negotiating volume and
spending quotas with hospitals. A major beneﬁt for hospital production and its
costs could probably be realised using DRG applications in hospital management
systems. However, for this purpose the DRG system as a base for output and cost
measurement is sufﬁcient, and DRG prices are not needed. Encouraging more
cost-efﬁcient operations would need evaluation studies using DRG based cost
information as a base for such incentives. For the Finnish municipalities, DRG
based hospital information systems and, in some cases, DRG prices too, could
achieve considerable beneﬁts, but this would require the municipalities to take a
more active role in decision making for hospital production. However, in the
existing system the hospital districts have established pricing systems, whereas the
municipalities have remained passive payers of specialised care.
An ideal hospital ﬁnancing system for Finland would be linked to the local
priorities of the local municipalities and to accurate information on hospital
production, based for example, on the DRG system. Models similar to the
alternative Swedish model of contract controlled budgets, so far not based on
DRG, are also being tested in Finland [24]. Using the system of contract controlled
budgets, municipal decision makers are better able to control hospital production
than before. In the future some hospitals plan to offer their specialised services to
municipalities using DRG related product deﬁnitions and prices as a basis for
contracts. Since the contracts between hospitals and municipalities are not com-
parable across hospital districts in the present system, price information based on
DRG would be useful in the contract process, especially for the municipalities. In
addition, particular local problems, such as the need to shorten queues or smooth
ﬁnancial risks for a small municipality could be included in the contracts.

Abstract: The integration of the Internet with traditional medical services is poised to transform 
health insurance policies. This study aims to explore the coordinating role of differentiated health 
insurance policies within the context of Internet healthcare. A four-stage sequential game 
decision-making model is developed within a queuing framework to address scenarios involving 
online patient referrals and misdiagnoses. The model begins by analyzing the equilibrium arrival 
strategy of patients, followed by the determination of optimal service capacity strategies for a 
nonprofit community health center (CHC) and optimal pricing strategies for a for-profit general 
hospital (GH). Additionally, the model describes an optimal differentiated subsidy strategy for the 
government aimed at minimizing total social costs. Analysis reveals that under certain conditions, 
an increase in the service price at GH relative to CHC can lead to a higher influx of online patients 
visiting GH in person. Furthermore, when the number of online patients exceeds a specific threshold, 
it not only prompts the government to increase the disparity in health insurance subsidies between 
the two hospital tiers but also encourages GH to reduce its service prices and offer free services to 
online patients. Numerical experiments explore the effects of government budgets, sharing ratios, 
and other variables on the system’s equilibrium state, providing several managerial insights. 
Notably, when patients' misdiagnosis costs are partially covered, increasing GH’s misdiagnosis 
cost-sharing ratio not only enhances the patient arrival rate but also enhances GH’s profitability.

1. Introduction  
Hierarchical healthcare systems are prevalent across various nations. For example, countries 
like the United Kingdom and the United States employ structured hierarchical healthcare 
frameworks. Within these systems, patients initially consult primary care physicians—known as 
family doctors in the US and general practitioners in the UK—who act as gatekeepers. These 
physicians make the initial diagnosis and, based on the disease's severity, decide whether the 
patient should be treated within the primary healthcare setting or referred to a larger general 
hospital [1]. In other countries, such as Canada, China, Japan, and Austria, the hierarchical 
healthcare system is grounded on a model of universal healthcare access, allowing patients the 
freedom to choose between community and general hospitals for their treatment. However, this 
model often leads patients to prefer tertiary care hospitals, resulting in underutilization and lack of 
motivation to seek care at primary healthcare institutions. This preference leads to an inefficient 
allocation of high-quality resources at tertiary hospitals for common diseases, while primary 
healthcare resources remain underutilized, diminishing the overall efficiency of the healthcare 
Journal Pre-proof
system [2]. For example, tertiary care hospitals in China, which constitute only 0.34% of all 
healthcare institutions, handle 26.48% of all patient consultations. In contrast, primary healthcare 
institutions, making up 94.85% of these facilities, account for just 50.71% of consultations [3]. 
Addressing the inefficiencies, resource wastage, and extended waiting times caused by patient 
preferences for medical treatment venues has become a focal point for both governments and 
academic scholars globally. 
Differentiated health insurance is a payment system designed by governments to manage 
healthcare costs under various conditions. This system involves government and health insurance 
entities establishing varying payment standards, which are aimed at encouraging patients to 
choose primary healthcare institutions for initial consultations. This is achieved by offering higher 
health insurance subsidies for visits to primary care facilities. The study explores the issue of 
differentiated healthcare payments, where patients exhibit choice behavior influenced by these 
financial incentives. Such policies have been extensively implemented in developed countries, 
including the United States, as seen with the preferred provider organization (PPO). Under the 
PPO, insured individuals are not required to register with a primary care physician and can 
directly access higher levels of care, albeit at a higher deductible. This approach is also gaining 
traction in some developing nations. For instance, the municipal government of Ningbo, China, 
has introduced a differentiated subsidy policy that reduces the cost for patients visiting primary 
hospitals by 11%–17% compared to those attending general hospitals. By providing financial 
incentives, differentiated health insurance policies aim to counteract the patient preference for 
higher-level healthcare services and redirect them towards primary care facilities. However, the 
limited service capacity of primary care institutions, particularly in developing countries like 
China, can restrict the effectiveness of these government-implemented differentiated healthcare 
insurance policies [4]. 
To tackle the issue of limited capacity in primary healthcare institutions, hospitals at various 
levels can effectively establish a healthcare alliance by collaboratively creating an Internet-based 
diagnostic and treatment platform. This initiative enhances and extends high-quality medical 
resources, thereby mitigating disparities in the distribution of these resources [5]. Internet 
healthcare represents a novel form of medical service that merges traditional healthcare with 
Internet information technology. The World Health Organization defines digital health 
preservation as a field concerned with the development and application of digital technologies for 
health [6], which aligns with the concept of Internet healthcare. Internet healthcare services are 
categorized into core and non-core services. Core services include Internet diagnosis and 
treatment services such as telemedicine, family doctor contracting services, and online 
management of certain common chronic diseases. Non-core services encompass patient support 
functions like appointment scheduling, mobile payments, and electronic medical records. The 
Internet-based medical platform discussed in this paper is central to Internet healthcare, acting as 
an intermediary for sharing diagnostic, treatment, and medical data across various medical 
institutions. This platform facilitates the sharing of information and resources, division of labor, 
and enhances the efficiency of medical resource utilization. For instance, the platform supports the 
distribution of high-quality medical resources by establishing Internet-based medical centers that 
utilize the existing resources of large general hospitals and setting up primary telemedicine 
subcenters. This structure provides patients at the grassroots level with cross-regional, 
cross-hospital, and cross-specialty Internet-based medical services. The integration of the Internet 
Journal Pre-proof
with traditional medical services inevitably influences changes in health insurance services. 
However, the lack of coverage for Internet-based medical services in health insurance policies 
could impede the further development of these services. 
As Internet healthcare services continue to evolve, nations are keenly exploring ways to 
integrate these services into existing health insurance frameworks to enhance healthcare efficiency. 
The United States pioneered telemedicine services but has yet to formulate a unified and effective 
policy for Internet health insurance. As of March 2021, 40 U.S. states had implemented some form 
of Internet healthcare services: 23 states require an equal subsidy for online and offline services, 
three states mandate that online service subsidy rates be no lower than those for offline services, and 
health insurance organizations in 10 states have abolished cost-sharing for online consultations [7]. 
In contrast, China faces regional disparities in health insurance policies, resulting in only 22.8% of 
hospitals accounting for telemedicine costs in their health insurance, despite a widespread provision 
of Internet healthcare services [8]. In the context of an unsound policy system related to Internet 
medical insurance, adopting the same subsidy policy for both online and offline services makes it 
difficult to encourage patients to use Internet diagnosis platforms for triage, thereby limiting the 
effectiveness of the online platform's triage role. Consequently, this study focuses on evaluating the 
impact of differentiated health insurance policies within the Internet medical environment, aiming 
to develop the growth of Internet-based medical care and improve health insurance systems. 
Furthermore, there is a noticeable gap in research linking health insurance regulations with 
Internet-based diagnostic and treatment platforms, particularly in their role in establishing 
hierarchical healthcare systems. This paper explores how the implementation of differentiated 
subsidy policies can be aligned with the hierarchical healthcare system through Internet-based 
platforms. It outlines a healthcare system where a general hospital (GH) offers both online and 
offline services, while a community health center (CHC) provides exclusively offline services. 
Queuing game theory has emerged as a prominent research tool in healthcare service operations [9]. 
This study employs queuing theory to model the patient queuing process within a healthcare system 
and utilizes game theory to analyze the dynamic decision-making of involved stakeholders. A 
queuing game model is developed to derive equilibrium decisions for all parties, taking into 
account the pricing disparities among different levels of hospitals and the constraints posed by 
online diagnosis and treatment platforms. To address this, the government has implemented 
differentiated health insurance subsidies aimed at maximizing patient welfare. The key questions 
this study seeks to address include: (1) How does a GH formulate service pricing strategies to 
optimize profits under a differentiated health insurance subsidy mechanism? What is the optimal 
service capacity for a CHC to maximize patient treatment utility? (2) What strategies should the 
government employ to set differentiated subsidies that maximize overall patient welfare? (3) How 
do different metrics such as patient initial rate, total hospital profit, waiting times, and social 
welfare respond to the differentiated healthcare subsidy mechanism? 
To address these questions, the study proposes an Internet healthcare system consisting of the 
government, GH, CHC, and patients, and utilizes a four-stage sequential game to model the 
dynamic interactions among these stakeholders. The process begins with the government setting 
differentiated subsidies for online patients at GH. Subsequently, GH adjusts its service prices 
based on the government's decisions to maximize profits. The nonprofit CHC then determines its 
service capacity within the confines of financial subsidies to maximize patient arrival rates. Lastly, 
patients make choices based on their preferences. Utilizing a backward recursion method, the 
Journal Pre-proof
study identifies the optimal decisions and properties for all parties in the system. Additionally, it 
explores the impacts of government budget, share ratios, and other factors on the system's 
equilibrium through numerical experiments. 
The rest of this article is structured as follows. The second section discusses the relevant 
literature. The third section presents the basic model. The fourth section examines the 
decision-making and characteristics of each participant. The fifth section utilizes numerical 
experiments to compare and examine the impact of the government budget on the equilibrium 
decisions of all participants and the system's overall performance. The sixth section summarizes 
the research findings and outlines future research directions. All proofs are provided in the 
Appendix. 
2. Literature review 
This study uses the queuing game model to examine the optimal decision-making of the 
Internet healthcare system by implementing differentiated health insurance policies. It primarily 
draws on two aspects of existing literature. Firstly, existing literature on optimal decision-making 
among all stakeholders in healthcare systems, particularly in the context of Internet-based 
healthcare. Secondly, existing literature on healthcare subsidy mechanisms. 
In recent years, Internet healthcare has become a popular topic in the field of healthcare 
service operation and management, with focusing on two main categories: the first category 
centers on investigating the service capacity of online service channels and their pricing 
decision-making issues. Hakan et al. [10] addressed the staffing and capacity allocation 
considering misdiagnosis in telemedicine. They concluded that online healthcare services cannot 
entirely substitute offline healthcare services but can complement traditional face-to-face 
diagnosis and treatment channels. Similarly, Rajan et al. [11] compared specialists' service 
capacities and pricing decisions before and after telemedicine implementation, finding that 
telemedicine introduction effectively enhances specialists' efficiency. Saghafian et al. [12] 
analyzed the optimal technology-level decision of Internet healthcare providers based on an agent 
knowledge model. Akcura and Ozdemir [13] examined service pricing strategies for dual-channel 
services (online and offline) that maximize doctors' revenue. Li et al. [14] compared Internet 
hospitals' profit under two pricing models (fixed pricing scheme and linear pricing scheme) and 
found that the fixed pricing scheme can maximize profits. The above studies focus on the pricing 
and capacity allocation of hospitals in the context of Internet healthcare and do not consider the 
overall impact of Internet platform in the hierarchical healthcare system on the system. In this 
paper, we propose the objectives and decision-making of hospitals with online service channels 
and consider the impact of each participant in the context of Internet healthcare from the 
perspective of the system as a whole. 
Another part of the direction of Internet healthcare operation management considers the 
referral process of patients between two different channels, online and offline. Wang et al [15] 
considered the misdiagnosis and referral of online diagnosis and treatment and analyzed the 
necessary conditions that hospitals could operate both online and offline service channels at the 
same time, as well as the hospital's optimal capacity allocation decisions. Wang et al. [16] examined 
the scenario where misdiagnosed patients require referral from an Internet hospital to a general 
hospital. By analyzing the price and service capacity decisions of non-profit general hospitals (GHs) 
and for-profit third-party Internet hospitals (TFs), the study concluded that TFs' service price and 
Journal Pre-proof
capacity decisions do not influence GHs' capacity decisions. Yang et al. [17] investigated pricing 
decisions maximizing physicians' revenue in the presence of misdiagnosis for online services. 
Additionally, Bavafa [18] empirically found that hospitals offering online services result in more 
patients opting for offline treatment. Compared to the above studies, this paper  does not only 
consider the role of inter-hospital service prices and waiting costs in influencing patients' referrals， 
also examines the impact of the health insurance reimbursement mechanism, an important 
coordinating tool of the government, on patients' decision-making. 
Currently, some studies on healthcare mechanisms primarily examine the role of healthcare 
reimbursement mechanisms within traditional healthcare delivery systems, or comparative 
analyses on the effects of various healthcare payment methods. Andritsos et al. [19] investigated 
the impact of the introduction of private hospitals and the increase in patients' mobility 
(inter-regional healthcare), two competing mechanisms. They constructed two distinct sequential 
game models involving patients, hospitals, and funders to assess their impact. Qu et al. [20] 
investigated a health insurance subsidy system that aimed at reducing waiting times in public 
hospitals and found that a lower subsidy scheme was more effective in reducing waiting time and 
consultation costs. Zhou et al. [21] developed a three-stage Stackelberg sequential game model to 
analyze the selection of designated hospitals for China's New Rural Cooperative Medical 
Insurance (NRCMI) and demonstrated that increasing the number of government-approved 
hospitals did not necessarily guarantee access to healthcare services for patients. Additionally, 
Adida [22] focused on interactions between two levels of hospitals within the healthcare system 
and analyzed the equilibrium solution of the system in terms of social welfare under the 
Fee-for-Service and penalty contract mechanisms. Guo et al. [23] analyzed the advantages, 
disadvantages, and applicability of fee-for-service (FFS) and bundled payment (BP) through a 
three-stage Stackelberg game model. The study found that the BP scheme was better than the FFS 
scheme in a healthcare delivery system with a low level of congestion, and Tan et al. [24] found 
that for middle-income countries, the Prospective Payment System (PPS) can reasonably control 
the costs while maintaining the quality of healthcare. These studies did not consider the overall 
impact of different health insurance policies on the system with the Internet healthcare 
environment. This study focuses on the issue of differentiated health insurance subsidies with the 
Internet platform. 
Most current researches on Internet healthcare policy employs empirical methods to 
investigate the shortcomings of Internet healthcare payment. For instance, Michal et al. [25] 
analyzed the key drivers of Internet healthcare adoption by comparing characteristics associated 
with Internet healthcare adoption in the United States before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The study concluded that removing geographic restrictions on Internet healthcare reimbursement 
between states could facilitate further integration of telemedicine capabilities. Aricca et al. [26] 
investigated impediments and incentives in the implementation of telemedicine health insurance 
reimbursement through focus groups and semi-structured interviews. Meanwhile, Mehta et al. [27] 
argued that health insurers offering Internet physicians the same fees as face-to-face consultations 
can alleviate concerns of healthcare organizations. In contrast to these empirical studies, this paper 
addresses the Internet health insurance payment problem by constructing a sequential game model 
within a queuing framework rather than empirical method. 
Journal Pre-proof
3. Model 
Within healthcare systems that suffer from limited service capacity, congestion is a common 
issue due to patients' sensitivity to delays. If health insurance policies are crafted without taking into 
account this delay-sensitive behavior, a significant mismatch between medical supply and demand 
is likely to occur. To address this, we apply queuing game theory to analyze patients' waiting 
behaviors while devising differentiated health insurance strategies across various medical 
institutions. We develop an internet healthcare system that includes patients, two tiers of hospitals, 
and the government. In this model, patients base their treatment decisions on personal utility, 
while hospitals have distinct objectives: general hospitals aim for profit maximization, and 
community hospitals focus on maximizing the effective arrival rate of patients. The government’s 
goal is to maximize social welfare. An objective function and a decision-making model for each 
participant are constructed, utilizing the parameters outlined in Table 1. 
3.1 Patient Decision Making 
For the Internet healthcare service system, which includes a GH and a CHC, the GH offers 
both online and offline outpatient services, as shown in Fig. 1. Using the operational model of a 
major general hospital in Dalian, it is postulated that the online platform caters exclusively to 
patients revisiting after an initial offline treatment at GH. The platform's focus is on diagnostic 
functions without providing subsequent treatment; hence, revisiting patients are required to seek 
further offline treatment at either GH or CHC following an online diagnosis. Patients are 
categorized based on their interaction with the hospital: offline initial patients, online revisiting 
patients (referred to as online patients), and offline revisiting patients. To simplify the model, the 
decision-making in this healthcare delivery system is primarily influenced by revisiting patients 
who are directed through the online channel, with offline revisiting patients being grouped 
together with offline initial patients. It is assumed that the arrival processes for initial patients at 
GH, online patients, and initial patients at CHC are modeled by Poisson distributions with 
respective parameters 𝜆1𝑓, 𝜆𝑟 and 𝜆2𝑓. Here, the labels "1" and "2" represent the GH and CHC, 
respectively, while 𝑓 and 𝑟 denote initial and online revisiting patients, respectively. At GH, 
initial patients either choose to enter or balk based on their perceived utility. The arrival rates for 
initial patients at CHC and online revisiting patients are constant, denoted as 𝜆2𝑓 and 𝜆𝑟, 
respectively. After receiving online treatment, revisiting patients are not discharged from the 
system; instead, they are categorized based on their utility and directed to either offline GH or 
CHC for further treatment, with balanced arrival rates 𝜆1𝑟 and 𝜆2𝑟 respectively, where 𝜆𝑟=
𝜆1𝑟+ 𝜆2𝑟. 
Both tiers of hospitals (GH and CHC) adhere to a first-come-first-served (FCFS) protocol 
and operate as 𝑀/𝑀/1  queuing systems. The service time at each hospital follows an 
independent exponential distribution with parameter 𝜇𝑖(𝑖= 1,2). Additionally, physicians utilize 
available gaps in their schedules to conduct online consultations through various media such as 
graphics, telephone, or video, with the consultation time for these online interactions assumed to 
be negligible [28]. The service capacity of GH’s offline channel is fixed at 𝜇1 [29], while the 
capacity at CHC must be adjusted if patients are referred downward from the online channel. It is 
assumed that patients treated at GH are fully cured and discharged, and the cure rate for patients at 
Journal Pre-proof
CHC is given by 𝑔(𝜇2), where patients not cured at CHC are referred upwards to GH for further 
treatment. To simplify the model, it is assumed that all misdiagnosed patients rejoin the end of the 
queue at GH without priority, which is a reasonable assumption for non-emergency outpatient 
services. The function 𝑔(𝜇2)  is defined as  1/(1 + 𝑒−𝑎𝜇2+𝑏) ，with 𝑔(0) = 0，𝑔(∞) =
1，and (𝑎> 0, 𝑏> 0) [23]. Based on these assumptions, the effective arrival rates for patients at 
GH and CHC are 𝜆1𝑒= 𝜆1𝑓+ 𝜆1𝑟+ (1 −𝑔(𝜇2))(𝜆2𝑓+ 𝜆2𝑟),  𝜆2𝑒= 𝑔(𝜇2)(𝜆2𝑓+ 𝜆2𝑟) , 
respectively. To maintain the stability of the queuing system, it is crucial that 𝜇𝑖 exceeds 𝜆𝑖𝑒 for 
each hospital. The expected utilities for initial patients at GH (𝑈1𝑓), online referral patients at GH 
(𝑈1𝑟), and online referral patients at CHC (𝑈2𝑟) are calculated as follows: 
𝑈1𝑓= 𝑉−𝛽𝑃−𝜆1𝑒

𝜇2
) + (1 −𝑔(𝜇2)) (𝑉−𝑃+ 𝑃0 −𝜆1𝑒

−𝑉
𝑚+ (𝑥1 + 𝑥2)𝑃) .
(3) 
The utility function for patients at the GH comprises three components. First, it includes the 
perceived value of the services provided by the hospital, represented by 𝑉. According to an 
empirical study by Ferreira and Marques et al., hospital facilities and staff levels have a low 
impact on patient perceptions [30]. Consequently, it is hypothesized that patients perceive the 
same value 𝑉 after receiving treatment at both GH and the CHC. Second, the function considers 
the hospital's treatment price, denoted as 𝑃. The variable 𝛽 represents the price differential 
between online and offline services, with 𝛽> 1. Telemedicine not only decreases the demand for 
routine outpatient treatment but also facilitates earlier patient discharge, thereby reducing overall 
treatment costs [10]. The third component relates to the costs associated with patient waiting times. 
An empirical study identified waiting time as a significant factor impacting patient utility in a 
two-tiered healthcare system [31]. This study quantifies the negative utility from system 
congestion using the congestion metrics of the 𝑀/𝑀/1 queuing model, with expected waiting 
costs for GH and CHC patients calculated as 
𝜆1𝑒
𝜇1  and 
𝜆2𝑒
𝜇2 , respectively, building on research by 
Kostami [32] and Zhou [33]. The utility for CHC patients is derived from two sources. Firstly, the 
utility gains from successfully curing patients at the CHC are considered. Given that GH typically 
incurs higher costs for providing the same services as CHC (attributable to more expensive 
doctors and equipment), it is assumed that GH's service prices are higher than those at CHC [34]. 
Furthermore, as public healthcare providers, CHC's services are priced low to ensure affordability 
for all patients. To streamline the model, the price of CHC services is normalized to 0 [35]. The 
second source of utility concerns the implications of misdiagnoses at CHC. When patients are 
incorrectly diagnosed and subsequently referred to GH, their condition deteriorates, resulting in a 
negative utility, denoted as 𝑉
𝑚 [29]. Both GH and CHC share a proportion of the misdiagnosis 
costs for patients referred downstream, denoted as 𝑥1 and 𝑥2, respectively, where 𝑥1 < 1, 𝑥2 <
1 and 𝑥1 + 𝑥2 < 1.

3.2 Two-tier hospitals 
Consider a two-tier healthcare delivery system comprising a CHC with a public welfare 
objective aimed at increasing effective patient arrival, and a for-profit GH with differentiated unit 
treatment costs, where 𝐶𝑖(𝑖= 1,2, 𝐶1 > 𝐶2). Given the government's budget (𝐵) and the unit cost 
of service capacity (𝐶𝜇2), the CHC aims to maximize effective patient arrival by setting its service 
capacity (𝜇2), after considering the government's differentiated subsidy amount and GH's service 
pricing strategy. The objective function of the CHC is as follows: 
𝑚𝑎𝑥
𝜇2 𝜆2𝑒,
(4) 
𝑠. 𝑡. 𝜇2𝐶𝜇2 ≤𝐵 
The service capacity at GH is assumed to be fixed in the short term. Therefore, GH focuses 
on maximizing its expected profit 𝜋(𝑃) by choosing an optimal service price (𝑃) once the 
government has set the differentiated subsidy amount (𝑃0). It is important to note that in some 
countries, such as China, regulatory constraints on healthcare pricing limit the freedom hospitals 
have to set prices. However, given the specialized nature of healthcare, doctors can tailor 
treatment plans based on the combined financial capability of the patient (including subsidies, 
health insurance, and deductibles) even for patients with identical medical conditions. 
Utilizing on the findings of Zhou et al. [21], it is postulated that market-based pricing could 
be feasible for GH. The objective function for GH is designed as follows: 
𝑚𝑎𝑥
𝑃
𝜋(𝑃) = 𝜆1𝑓(𝛽𝑃−𝐶1) + (𝜆1𝑓+ (1 −𝑔(𝜇2))𝜆2𝑟)(𝑃−𝐶1) + (1 −𝑔(𝜇2))𝜆2𝑟(𝑃−𝐶1 −𝑥1). 
(5) 
3.3 Government 
As a system-wide policymaker, the government must balance the operational needs of 
hospitals with the broader goal of social welfare. Typically, government policies aim to maximize 
social welfare, which is defined as the sum of hospital profits and the net utility of patients. 
However, since this study assumes a fixed perceived value of treatment and some initial patients at 
GH choose to balk (resulting in a net utility of zero for these patients), the government’s approach 
Journal Pre-proof
to social welfare may not include the net utility of GH’s initial patients. From a system-wide 
perspective, the government opts to set different subsidy levels (𝑃0) between the hospitals to 
minimize total social costs. According to Li [29] and Zhou [37], the societal costs encompass: (a) 
the cost of treating patients at both GH and CHC, (b) the cost borne by CHC for sharing patient 
misdiagnosis costs, (c) the government’s budget allocated to enhancing CHC’s service capacity 
(𝐵). (d) the cost associated with patients balking (𝐶0), and (e) the cost of differentiated 
government subsidies. The government's objective function is formulated to reflect these 
considerations as follows: 
𝑚𝑖𝑛
𝑃0 𝑇𝐶= 𝜆1𝑒𝐶1 + 𝜆2𝑒𝐶2 + (1 −𝑔(𝜇2))𝜆2𝑟𝑥2𝑃+ 𝐵+ 𝐶0(𝛬−𝜆1𝑓)

The government aims to minimize total social costs by setting differentiated subsidy amounts 
(𝑃0) between the two hospitals. Subsequently, GH sets its service prices (𝑃) with the objective of 
maximizing profits, once the government has established the subsidy level. CHC, functioning as a 
public healthcare provider, then determines its service capacity (𝜇2) to maximize the effective 
arrival rate of its patients, considering both the government's subsidy decision and GH's pricing 
strategy. Patients, on the other hand, decide whether to enter GH's offline service channel or balk 
based on their utility. Online patients must choose whether to seek consultation at GH or CHC. 
Therefore, decision-making within this healthcare delivery system follows a structured four-stage 
game process, as illustrated in Fig. 2, as provided below: 
Stage 1: The government determines the amount of differentiated subsidies (𝑃0) to minimize 
total social costs. 
Stage 2: GH sets its service price (𝑃), aiming to maximize economic efficiency. 
Stage 3: CHC adjusts its service capacity (𝜇2), to maximize the effective arrival rate of 
patients. 
Journal Pre-proof
Stage 4: Patients make their healthcare choices based on their utility, opting for different 
hospitals accordingly. 
 
Fig. 2. Game Process 
4. Decision analysis of Internet medical service system 
A backward recursive approach is employed to investigate the optimal decisions and the 
properties of patients (GH’s initial patient, online patient), GH, CHC, and government in the 
Internet healthcare system. Proofs of all the following propositions are provided in the Appendix. 
4.1 Patient decision-making 
Given the service capacity of CHC 𝜇2, the service price at the GH 𝑃, and the amount of 
differentiated subsidy from the government 𝑃0, initial patients at the GH decide whether to enter the 
system based on utility; the online patients choose to visit the GH or the CHC based on utility. 
The choice behavior of GH’s initial patients is divided into the following two scenarios: 
i. 
When 𝑈1𝑓≥0, The GH’s initial patients choose to enter the GH offline for treatment; 
ii. 
When 𝑈1𝑓< 0, The GH’s initial patients balk because they cannot attain positive 
utility. 
The choice behavior of online patients is categorized into the following three scenarios: 
i. 
When 𝑈1𝑟= 𝑈2𝑟, an equilibrium state exists, where some patients opt for treatment at 
GH and others choose treatment at CHC; 
ii. 
When 𝑈1𝑟< 𝑈2𝑟, All online patients opt to visit CHC; 
iii. 
When 𝑈1𝑟> 𝑈2𝑟 All online patients opt to visit GH. 
According to patient choice behavior, the critical value for the initial patient to enter this 
healthcare delivery system is  𝑈1𝑓= 0. For online patients, when U1r < U2r, all online patients 
will choose to go to CHC. If an internet-based platform service is developed, GH will be responsible 
for the cost of misdiagnosis associated with patients referred to CHC through the online channel. At 
this point, the optimal strategy for GH is to refrain from offering online consultation services. When 
𝑈1𝑟> 𝑈2𝑟, all online patients will visit GH, allowing GH to increase the service price until 𝑈1𝑟=
𝑈2𝑟 holds, thereby maximizing profits. In the subsequent analysis, we only consider patient choice 
behavior that satisfies the equilibrium condition described by the following equation: 
𝑉−𝛽𝑃−𝜆1𝑒
𝜇1
= 0,
(7) 
(𝛽−1)𝑃+ 𝑃0 = 𝑔(𝜇2) (𝑉−𝜆2𝑒
𝜇2
) + (1 −𝑔(𝜇2))((𝛽−1 + 𝑥1 + 𝑥2)𝑃+ 𝑃0 −𝑉
𝑚),
(8) 
Combining equations (7) and (8) results in the following proposition: 
Journal Pre-proof
Proposition 1: Given the amount of differentiated government subsidy 𝑃0, the service price of 
GH services 𝑃, and the service capacity of CHC 𝜇2, the equilibrium arrival rate of GH’s initial 
patients 𝜆1𝑓
∗, the equilibrium arrival rate of online patients 𝜆1𝑟
∗, and the arrival rate of CHC online 
patients 𝜆2𝑟
∗ satisfy: 
𝜆1𝑓
∗
= (𝜇1 + 𝜇2)𝑉−(𝜇1𝛽+ 𝜇2𝐴1)𝑃−𝜇2𝑃0 −𝜇2𝐴0𝑉
𝑚−𝜆𝑟−𝜆2𝑓. 
𝜆1𝑟
∗= 𝜆𝑟+ 𝜆2𝑓−
𝜇2
𝑔(𝜇2) (𝑉−𝐴1𝑃−𝐴0𝑉
𝑚−𝑃0). 
𝜆2𝑟
∗
=
𝜇2
𝑔(𝜇2) (𝑉−𝐴1𝑃−𝐴0𝑉
𝑚−𝑃0) −𝜆2𝑓. 
Where，𝐴0 = (
1
𝑔(𝜇2) −1) , 𝐴1 = (𝛽−1 −𝐴0(𝑥1 + 𝑥2)). 
Proposition 1 provides the arrival rates of GH’s initial patients, GH online referral, and CHC 
online referral patients in the equilibrium state of the system. It can be observed that as the arrival 
rate of CHC’s initial patients 𝜆2𝑓 increases, 𝜆2𝑟
∗ and 𝜆1𝑓
∗ decrease, while 𝜆1𝑟
∗ increases. This is 
because with the number of CHC’s initial patients increasing, the CHC unit wait time improves, 
and then more online patients are referred to GH for care, thereby causing GH wait times to 
improve and some GH’s initial patients to balk. 
Proposition 2:  If (𝑥1 + 𝑥2) <
𝛽−1
𝐴0 , as the service price of GH 𝑃 increases, 𝜆2𝑟
∗ decreases, 
and 𝜆1𝑟
∗ increases; Otherwise, 𝜆2𝑟
∗ increases, and 𝜆1𝑟
∗ increases. 
Proposition 2 suggests that when the deductible share of patients' misdiagnosis costs is high 
(i.e., (𝑥1 + 𝑥2) <
𝛽−1
𝐴0 ), more and more online patients travel to GH offline as the service price of 
GH increases. At this point, CHC online patients have a large deductible rate of misdiagnosis costs, 
and the increase in the cost of GH treatment due to higher service price is less than the increase in 
the cost of CHC misdiagnosis for online patients. Therefore, even though the service price of GH is 
increasing, more and more online patients are willing to be referred GH offline. The converse is 
equally true. 
4.2 Decision-making in Two-tier hospitals 
As a public healthcare provider, CHC needs to maximize the effective patient arrival rate 
through its decision-making on service capacity, while ensuring that the hospital's profitability 
remains non-negative. According to the CHC objective function, the following proposition can be 
derived: 
Proposition 3: Given 𝑃0 and 𝑃, the optimal decision for the CHC is to invest all of the 
government budget in expanding its service capacity, i.e. 
𝜇2
∗= 𝐵
𝐶𝜇2
. 
Since a condition for a non-profit organization is to cover its operating costs without 
generating profits, the conclusion of Proposition 3 is more intuitive and consistent with the findings 
of the empirical study by Horwitz and Nichols [38]. Next, its equilibrium decision is analyzed 
according to the GH objective function. 
Proposition 4: Given the government's subsidy 𝑃0, the optimal service price 𝑃0
∗ for GH is 
determined as follows:

Proposition 4 shows that the size of online patients affects the optimal pricing decision of the 
GH: when the size of online patients is smaller than a threshold, then there exists an optimal pricing 
decision for the GH to maximize its profit, while when the size of online patients is larger than a 
threshold, the optimal price of the service for the GH is equal to the service cost. An empirical study 
by Zachary et al. [39] reveals that the majority of patients still prefer visiting offline hospitals, with 
online patients being relatively small in size. Consequently, the subsequent analysis focuses solely 
on the scenario where online patients are small and GH makes an optimal pricing decision.

Propositions 5 and 6 describe the trends in GH optimal service price decisions concerning 𝑥2 
and 𝜇1. Proposition 5 indicates that as the CHC's share of patients' misdiagnosis costs expands, 
more online patients are referred to CHC for treatment. Consequently, the waiting costs for patients 
seeking treatment at GH decrease, prompting for-profit GH to increase its service price to maximize 
profits. Proposition 6 indicates that when the unit cost of treatment for GH patients exceeds a certain 
threshold, GH is inclined to raise the service price to maximize profits per patient treated. 
Conversely, when the unit cost of treatment for GH patients falls below a certain threshold, GH 
prefers to reduce its service price to treat more patients to increase profits. 
4.3 Government's Differentiated Subsidy Decisions 
Predicting the patient arrival rates in two-tier hospitals, the CHC optimal service capacity 𝜇2
∗ 
and the GH optimal service price decision 𝑃∗, the government determines the optimal differentiated 
subsidy price under the objective of minimizing the total social cost.

Proposition 7 suggests that the government's optimal differentiated subsidy decision depends 
on online patient size: when online patient size is above a certain threshold, the government's 
optimal differentiated subsidy amount is equal to zero, i.e., it widens the difference in subsidies 
between the two levels of hospitals and directs patients to CHC. When the online patient size is 
below a certain threshold, there always exists a unique optimal differentiated subsidy strategy. The 
reason for this phenomenon is that, according to Proposition 1, with the expansion of online patient 
size, the number of GH’s initial patients and CHC online referral patients decreases while the 
number of GH online referral patients increases. When the online patient size surpasses a certain 
threshold, a significant portion of GH's high-quality medical resources is utilized for treating online 
patients with common and chronic diseases, leading to the loss of initial patients and an overall 
increase in the patients loss cost of the system. Consequently, the government tends to widen the 
subsidy gap between the two levels of hospitals and encourage the downward referral of online 
patients. When the online patient size is small, the government can consider various factors such as 
system patients loss cost, subsidy cost, treatment cost, and misdiagnosis cost to determine the 
optimal amount of differentiated subsidy that minimizes the total social cost. Taking into account 
Proposition 4 and Proposition 7, it's evident that the online patient size significantly influences GH 
pricing decisions within the Internet diagnosis and treatment system, as well as the government's 
differentiated subsidy decisions. 
Given the complexity of the government's optimal solution, it is not feasible to analyze the 
property of the equilibrium decisions of the parties and the main performance indicators of the 
system in the equilibrium state from a theoretical perspective. Therefore, a numerical simulation 
method is employed to examine the relevant properties of the system in the equilibrium state. 
5. Numerical analysis 
In this section, numerical experiments are conducted to analyze the effects of the GH share of 
misdiagnosed patient costs 𝑥1 , the CHC share of misdiagnosed patient costs 𝑥2 , and the 
government budget 𝐵 on the equilibrium decisions of each party (patient arrival rate, GH service 
price, differentiated subsidies) and the equilibrium performance of the system (overall GH profit, 
Journal Pre-proof
total social cost, total patient waiting time). The relevant parameter settings in the numerical 
experiments satisfy the basic assumptions in the text without loss of generality, setting 
parameters 𝑉= 1.4，𝐶1 = 0.4，𝐶2 = 0.35，𝑎= 1，𝑏= 2.5，𝜇1 = 5，𝛽= 1.4，𝑉
𝑚= 1.5，
𝜆𝑟= 1.5，𝐶0 = 0.155，𝐶𝜇2 = 2，𝜆2𝑓= 1，𝛬= 8. 
Firstly, the impact of the change in the GH share of misdiagnosis costs (𝑥1) is discussed on the 
system equilibrium. To comprehensively examine its effect, we divide it into two scenarios: partial 
coverage of patient misdiagnosis costs (Fig. 3) and full coverage of patient misdiagnosis costs (Fig. 
4) In the scenario of partial coverage of misdiagnosis costs, the sum of the misdiagnosis 
cost-sharing ratios of the two levels of hospitals is less than 1 (i.e., 𝑥1 + 𝑥2 < 1), and patients are 
still required to pay a portion of the misdiagnosis costs. In this case, as 𝑥1 increases, the CHC 
misdiagnosis cost-sharing ratio 𝑥2 remains unchanged, and the patient's deductible payment ratio 
decreases. In the scenario of full coverage of the patient's misdiagnosis costs, the sum of the 
misdiagnosis cost-sharing ratios of the two levels of hospitals is equal to 1 (i.e., 𝑥1 + 𝑥2 = 1), and 
the patient does not need to pay deductible for the misdiagnosis costs. Here, as 𝑥1 increases, the 
CHC misdiagnosis cost-sharing ratio 𝑥2 decreases, and the patient's deductible rate is always zero. 
Journal Pre-proof
 
Fig. 3 Impact of 𝑥1 on system equilibrium under partial coverage of misdiagnosis costs 
（𝐵= 6, 𝛽= 1.4, 𝑥1 ∈(0,0.8), 𝑥2 = 0.2） 
Fig. 3 demonstrates the impact of 𝑥1 on the system equilibrium when the cost of missed 
appointments is partially covered. Fig. 3 (b) and Fig. 3 (e) shows that as 𝑥1 continues to increase, 
𝜆1𝑓
∗ and 𝜆2𝑟
∗ increase, 𝜆1𝑟
∗ decreases, and total patient waiting costs increase. This is due to lower 
deductible payments for misdiagnosis costs for patients referred to the CHC via the online channel, 
and more online patients are referred to the CHC, at which point the GH wait time decreases, 
attracting more initial patients into the system. When all online patients visit CHC, as 𝑥1 further 
increases and 𝑃∗ decreases (as shown in Fig. 3 (a), the GH’s initial patients still increase by a small 
amount, the total number of patients in the system increases, and the total waiting time of the 
patients increases. From the GH perspective, when the GH sharing ratio is small (𝑥1<0.3), there are 
fewer CHC’s online patients, the GH misdiagnosis cost is low, and the GH can improve 𝑃∗ to 
obtain higher profits; when the GH sharing ratio is large (𝑥1>0.3), the GH misdiagnosis cost is 
increasing as 𝑥1 and 𝜆2𝑟
∗ increase. GH will take price reductions to reduce GH's misdiagnosis 
Journal Pre-proof
costs by reducing patient misdiagnosis costs on the one hand, and slowing down the downward 
transfer of online patients on the other hand. As shown in Fig. 3 (c), as 𝑥1 increases, 𝑃∗ and 𝜆1𝑓
∗ 
increase, so GH's profit will briefly increase, and as 𝑥1 further increases, GH's misdiagnosis cost 
keeps increasing and service price keeps decreasing, so its profit decreases. As CHC is a non-profit 
public hospital, the part of misdiagnosis patient treatment CHC shares is also borne by the 
government, as 𝜆2𝑟
∗ increases, the government increases 𝑃0
∗ to narrow the subsidy difference 
between GH and CHC, slowing down the rate of increase of 𝜆2𝑟
∗, and decreasing the rate of increase 
of the government's misdiagnosis cost-sharing. Since 𝜆2𝑟
∗ is rising and the cost of subsidies is 
increasing, the total cost to society is trending upwards (as shown in Fig. 3 (a) and Fig. 3 (d). The 
main managerial implication of Fig. 3 is that when the cost of misdiagnosis is partially covered, GH 
can proactively increase the misdiagnosis sharing ratio while increasing the service price to divert 
online patients to CHC, which can be more profitable by treating more initial patients. 
Next, the impact of 𝑥1 on the system equilibrium is explored when misdiagnosis costs are 
fully covered. As shown in Fig. 4, as 𝑥1 increases, the cost of misdiagnosis for patients referred 
online at CHC is fully reimbursed by both hospitals, and all online patients travel to CHC. Further 
increases in 𝑥1 lead to the expansion of the GH misdiagnosis cost share. Consequently, GH reduces 
its service price, reducing the cost of patient misdiagnosis and decreasing the cost of GH 
misdiagnosis. However, the GH misdiagnosis cost is increasing, and the service price is decreasing, 
so its profit is decreasing. 𝑃∗ decreasing, the GH’s initial patient will still increase slightly, the total 
number of patients in the system will increase, and the total waiting time of patients will increase. 
From the government's point of view, when the cost of misdiagnosis is fully covered, the GH share 
increases and the CHC share decreases, while the government decreases 𝑃0
∗, the cost of social 
subsidy decreases, and the total social cost decreases. Comparing Fig. 3and 4, it can be found that 
compared with Fig. 3, the change of 𝑥1 in Fig. 4 has a smaller impact on the system equilibrium, 
which indicates that compared with the case of full coverage of patients' misdiagnosis costs, the GH 
sharing ratio has a greater impact on the system equilibrium performance in the case of partial 
coverage.

Fig. 4 Impact of 𝑥1 on system equilibrium under all coverage of misdiagnosis costs 
（𝐵= 6, 𝛽= 1.4, 𝑥1 ∈(0.8,1), 𝑥2 ∈(0,0.2)） 
Next, we examine the impact of changes in the CHC sharing ratio 𝑥2 of the misdiagnosis cost 
on the system equilibrium. Through numerical experiments, it is observed that the trend of 𝑥2 
remains consistent in both scenarios of partial and full coverage of patients' misdiagnosis costs. 
Therefore, the paper focuses solely on the impact of 𝑥2 on the system under partial coverage of 
misdiagnosis costs, as depicted in Fig. 5. 
Journal Pre-proof
 
Fig. 5 Impact of 𝑥2 on system equilibrium under partial coverage of misdiagnosis costs 
（𝐵= 6, 𝛽= 1.4, 𝑥1 = 0.2, 𝑥2 ∈(0,0.8)） 
A threshold value for 𝑥2 can be determined from Fig. 5. When 𝑥2 is below the threshold, 
increasing 𝑥2  leads to more online patients opting for CHC offline services. GH can then 
accommodate more initial patients, resulting in a continuous increase in total patient waiting time. 
Meanwhile, GH raises service price to maximize profits. Although the government's share of 
misdiagnosis costs expands, the number of CHC online patients remains low, resulting in relatively 
low misdiagnosis costs. Consequently, the government refrains from subsidizing GH online patients 
and reducing subsidy costs. When 𝑥2 is greater than the threshold, with the increase of 𝑥2, the 
government will continuously increase the subsidy 𝑃0
∗, reduce the subsidy difference between the 
two levels of hospitals, and reduce the downward transfer of online patients. At this time, patients 
on the GH online slowly increase, GH waiting time increases, while 𝑃∗ increases, so the first 
patient is constantly lost, total patient waiting time decreases, and GH profits decrease. That is, there 
exists an optimal cost-sharing ratio for misdiagnosis in CHC，which not only improves patient 
Journal Pre-proof
accessibility but also results in higher profits for GH. An over-sharing ratio in CHC, not only brings 
a greater financial burden to the government but also reduces the accessibility of patients and the 
profitability of GHs. 
 
Fig. 6 Impact of government budget 𝐵 on system equilibrium 
（𝐵∈(5,8), 𝛽= 1.4, 𝑥1 = 0.2, 𝑥2 = 0.2） 
Next, the impact of the government budget 𝐵 on the system equilibrium is analyzed. As 
shown in Fig. 6, when 𝐵 is small (𝐵<1), incremental increases in 𝐵 lead to corresponding 
increments in 𝑃∗, while 𝑃0
∗ remains at zero. Consequently, the total social cost increases, with a 
slight rise observed in 𝜆1𝑓
∗. The arrival rate of online patients at both hospitals remains unchanged, 
resulting in a gradual increase in GH profits while maintaining the total patient waiting time 
constant. However, when 𝐵 is large (𝐵>1), continuous increases in 𝐵 result in incremental 
changes in 𝑃∗, while 𝑃0
∗ continuously increments from zero. This leads to a further increase in total 
social cost, with 𝜆1𝑓
∗ experiencing increments as well. Eventually, 𝜆1𝑟
∗ decreases to zero gradually, 
and 𝜆2𝑟
∗ increases until all patients in the queue are transferred to CHC. GH profits experience a 
Journal Pre-proof
significant increase, accompanied by an increase in total patient waiting time. 
This is because when 𝐵 is small, the total cost to society increases as 𝐵 continues to increase; 
CHC which aims to maximize effective patient arrival rates invests all government budgets in 
building service capacity, i.e., incrementally increasing 𝜇2. CHC which has increased its service 
capacity has seen lower waiting times for its patients, higher cure rates, and a reduction in the 
number of misdiagnosed patients that GH is required to see from CHC's offline. As a result, the 
GH’s initial patient arrival rate has risen by a small margin. However, at this time, government 
investment is low, the cure rate and service capacity of CHC are still at a low level, and online 
patients still mostly travel to GH. Patient arrival rates at both hospitals remain stable, and total 
patient waiting time remains unchanged. GH will increase the service price to gain higher profits; 
when 𝐵 is larger, as 𝐵 keeps increasing, CHC patient waiting time decreases, cure rate increases, 
and more online patients refer to CHC, i.e., 𝜆1𝑓
∗ and 𝜆2𝑟
∗ are increasing, and 𝜆1𝑟
∗ is decreasing. As 
a result, total patient waiting costs incrementally increase. At this time, GH experiences a reduction 
in online patients, allowing for the accommodation of more initial patients. GH aims to maximize 
profits by increasing the service price. Additionally, an excess of CHC online patients lead to higher 
misdiagnosis costs for the government. Consequently, the government takes steps to increase 𝑃0
∗, 
directing online patients to GH and slowing down the rate of downstream transfer of online patients  
When all online patients are referred to CHC for consultation, although the online patient 
arrival rate between the two levels of hospitals remains the same, as 𝐵 increases, the CHC 
misdiagnosis rate decreases, and the number of misdiagnosed patients in CHC treated by the GH 
decreases, and therefore there is a small increase in the number of initial patients in the GH. It can be 
found in Fig. 6 that increasing the government budget 𝐵 can improve the accessibility of healthcare 
services and the efficiency of healthcare resource utilization, as well as bringing higher profits to 
GH. However, the service price of patient and the total cost to society will also continue to increase, 
bringing a greater financial burden to the government. 
To examine the robustness of the numerical experiment results and to provide management 
insights for the government to develop differentiated subsidy policies under different 
circumstances, we next examine the changes in the system equilibrium, with different price 
difference 𝛽 between GH online and offline, and different unit cost of patients balking 𝐶0 for the 
government. The results of the previous numerical experiments show that the change in the total 
social waiting cost 𝑇𝑊𝐶 is the same as that of the initial patient arrival rate at GH because the 
overall service capacity of the system changes by a small margin. Thus, the impact of parameter 
changes on the total social cost will not be discussed separately. First, we compare and analyze the 
system equilibrium with the impact of the government budget 𝐵 for different online and offline 
service price differences (𝛽= 1, 1.4, 1.8). Where, when 𝛽= 1, it represents that the service price 
of online and offline services in GH are equal. 
Journal Pre-proof
 
Fig. 7 Impact of 𝐵 on equilibrium decision-making by the Government and GH with different 𝛽 
Fig. 7 (a) shows that when the price difference 𝛽 increases, the government reduces the 
amount of subsidy for GH online patients to increase subsidy difference between GH and CHC. 
From Fig. 7 (b), the GH reduces the service price. This is because when 𝛽 increases, the service 
price of initial patients at GH increases, leading to the loss of initial patients. To reduce the cost 
due to the balking of initial patients at GH, the government expands the subsidy difference 
between GH and CHC to guide online patients to referral to CHC, thereby reducing congestion of 
GH. With higher 𝛽, GH treatment for initial patients can bring higher profits, so for-profit GH 
will reduce the price to attract more initial patients. 
 
Fig. 8 Impact of 𝐵 on system equilibrium performance with different 𝛽 
The equilibrium arrival rate of patients, as illustrated in Fig. 8 (a) and (b), shows a consistent 
relationship with the government budget 𝐵 across systems with different 𝛽. Specifically, as B 
increases, the arrival rate of initial patients at GH 𝜆1𝑓, and the arrival rate of online patients at CHC 
Journal Pre-proof
𝜆2𝑟 increase, while the arrival rate of online patients at GH 𝜆1𝑟 decreases. Moreover, in systems 
with small 𝛽 (𝛽= 1), changes in 𝐵 significantly affect equilibrium patient arrival rates when 𝐵 is 
low (specifically, 𝐵< 5.5). This sensitivity arises because it is costlier for online patients to receive 
treatment at GH in systems with small 𝛽 (Fig. 7 (b)). Consequently, increasing the budget enhances 
the service capacity of CHC, referring more online patients there and allowing GH to accommodate 
more initial patients. 
Fig. 8 (c) and (d) illustrates how the system's equilibrium performance varies with different 𝛽. 
As 𝛽 increases, the total social cost 𝑇𝐶 remains stable, and a decrease in GH's profits. This is due 
to the referral of online patients to CHC and an increase in initial patients at GH, which raises 
misdiagnosis costs but reduces the cost of patients balking, resulting in minimal overall social cost 
change. For GH, while treating more initial patients, GH profit decreases with 𝛽 due to reduced 
service price (Fig. 8 (d)). In this case, with 𝛽= 1, when 𝐵 is small (𝐵< 5.5), online patient losses 
exceed the increase in initial patients at GH (Fig. 8 (a) and (b)). Since the GH earns equal profits 
from treating online patients and initial patients, the overall number of patients treated decreases, 
and the profit of the GH decreases. Combining the findings from Fig. 7 and Fig. 8 offers 
management insights for the government to coordinate healthcare systems with different price 
differences: In healthcare systems with a significant price difference between online and offline 
services, the government can augment investment in service capacity of CHC and enlarge subsidy 
difference between GH and CHC. This strategy increases online patients for referral to CHC, 
thereby decreasing the expense of patient care without increasing the total social cost. 
Considering the reality that there are situations where the unit cost of patients balking 
exceeds the cost of treatment. Subsequently, different equilibrium states of the system are 
compared for three different unit costs of patients baking cases (High 𝐶0 = 4, Middle 𝐶0 = 0.6, 
Low 𝐶0 = 0.155), where the system unit costs of patients baking is greater than the unit cost of 
treatment for GH patients for the High and Middle 𝐶0 cases.  
 
Fig. 9 Impact of 𝐵 on equilibrium decision-making by the Government and GH with different 𝐶0 
As is shown in Fig. 9, the government equilibrium differentiated subsidy and equilibrium 
service price of GH with government budget 𝐵 is given under the different unit costs of patients 
balking. It can be found that the amount of government equilibrium differentiated subsidy is equal 
to zero for the High and Middle 𝐶0 cases. The equilibrium service price of GH increases with 𝐶0.In 
cases where the unit cost of patients balking is high, the government will not provide subsidies for 
online patients at GH, thereby expanding the subsidy difference between GH and CHC to reduce 
subsidy costs while referring online patients to CHC. Moreover, since the increase in the unit cost of 
patients balking is borne by the government, it does not result in greater costs for GH. Consequently, 
Journal Pre-proof
once the government decides to widen the subsidy difference, the for-profit GH will opt to increase 
the service price to maximize profits. 
 
Fig. 10 Impact of 𝐵 on system equilibrium performance with different 𝐶0 
Fig. 10 compares the change of system equilibrium under different unit costs of patients 
balking. Fig. 10 (a) and (c) illustrate that as 𝐶0 increases, the GH initial patient arrival rate 
decreases, and the total social cost increases. This occurs because the service price of for-profit 
GH rises with a larger 𝐶0 (Fig. 9 (b)), resulting in fewer GH initial patients and higher total 
social costs. In addition, Fig. 10 (c) shows that in the extreme case (High 𝐶0 = 4, 𝐶0 is much 
higher than the cost of treatment), the total social cost increases and then decreases with 𝐵, and 
finally increases slowly. The reason for change in total social cost can be obtained by Fig. 10 (a): 
since the system unit cost of patients balking is much higher than other costs in the extreme case, 
the total social cost is mainly affected by the cost of patients balking. Therefore, when 𝐵 is 
small (𝐵< 6.5), the trend of total social cost with 𝐵 is opposite to the trend of initial patient 
arrival rate with 𝐵 (i.e., the initial patient arrival rate decreases first and then increases, 
resulting in the trend of total social cost increasing first and then decreasing with 𝐵). When 𝐵 
is large (𝐵≥6.5), the initial patient arrival rate no longer changes, and the total social cost 
increases slowly because 𝐵 keeps rising. Meanwhile, although for-profit GH increases the 
service price, its total profit decreases due to the high loss of initial patients. This also provides 
management insights for the government: when the unit cost of patients balking is high, the 
government's differentiated subsidy policy may increase the service price for patients and 
reduce patient accessibility. 
Finally, to further examine the robustness of the results and the effects of other parameters, 
a comprehensive sensitivity analysis of the model is carried out. Table 2 shows the effects of 
other parameters on the equilibrium decision and the performance of the system, referring to 
Journal Pre-proof
the study of Teymourifar et al. [40] and Chen et al. [41] (𝜆1𝑓 denotes patient accessibility). The 
first row of Table 2 indicates the system equilibrium under the parameters given above, and then, 
we change one of the parameters at a time with the other parameters fixed.

As is shown in Table 2, the impact of GH unit treatment cost 𝐶1 and CHC unit treatment cost 
𝐶2 are compared. It is observed that the equilibrium differentiated subsidies, the equilibrium service 
price of GH, the total waiting time, and the arrival rate of initial patient have opposite trends 
concerning 𝐶1 and 𝐶2, while the total social cost and the profit of GH exhibit the same trend. This 
phenomenon occurs because when 𝐶1 is raised, the cost of patient treatment in GH increases. As a 
response, the government increases the subsidy difference to promote the referral of online patients 
to CHC, and GH raises the service price to pursue profit maximization, resulting in fewer initial 
patients in GH and a lower total waiting time in the system. Likewise, when 𝐶2 is raised, the 
government reduces the subsidy difference and diminishes the referral of online patients to CHC. 
From Proposition 2, the non-profit CHC will invest all government budget in service capacity, and 
the CHC’s service capacity 𝜇2 is the ratio of the government budget 𝐵 and the CHC's cost per unit 
of service capacity 𝐶𝜇2(i.e. 𝜇2 =
𝐵
𝐶𝜇2). Therefore, the change of 𝐶𝜇2 has the opposite impact on 
system equilibrium as the government budget 𝐵 in Fig. 6. With the increase of 𝐶𝜇2, the government 
equilibrium differentiated subsidy, the equilibrium service price of GH, and the equilibrium service 
capacity of CHC decrease, and all the system performances (𝑇𝑊𝐶, 𝑇𝐶, 𝜋 and 𝜆1𝑓) decrease, 
following the same mechanism as shown in Fig. 6. 
6. Conclusion 
A four-stage sequential game model is constructed, considering the limitations of online 
diagnosis and treatment platforms and the misdiagnosis of CHCs. This model involves the 
government, GHs operating online and offline service channels, CHCs, and patients. It offers a 
reference for the government in formulating differentiated health insurance policies within the 
context of Internet healthcare，and also gives managerial insights for pricing of for-profit GHs and 
Journal Pre-proof
capacity decisions of public interest CHCs within a healthcare alliance. The study found that: (1) 
The effect of service price on online patient arrival rate is contingent upon the patient's deductible 
payment rate for misdiagnosis: when the deductible payment rate for misdiagnosis is high, an 
increase in GHs service price prompts more online patients to opt for offline treatment at GHs. 
Conversely, when the deductible rate for patient misdiagnosis is low, a rise in GH service price 
results in more online patients seeking treatment at CHCs. From a policymaker standpoint, a low 
deductible payment rate for misdiagnosed patients facilitates patients referred to GH and CHC, 
thereby enhancing system efficiency, even if GHs increase their service price. Thus, policymakers 
need to offer a higher subsidy rate for misdiagnosed patients to foster the development of a 
hierarchical diagnosis and treatment system. (2) The number of online patients influences both the 
pricing decisions of GHs and the government's strategy for differentiated subsidies. Expanding the 
number of online patients not only reduces the service price of patient but also enhances hospital 
resource utilization efficiency, decreases government subsidy expenses, and alleviates financial 
burdens. Thus, in regions with more advanced Internet medical infrastructure, differentiated 
subsidies based on online patient scales can effectively encourage patient transfer and facilitate 
hierarchical diagnosis and treatment. 
Numerical experiment results gave the following management insights: (1) In some instances, 
an increase in the GH share of misdiagnosed patient costs can lead to higher profits. This provides a 
counterintuitive managerial insight into the negotiation between the government and GHs to 
determine the GHs’ share of misdiagnosed patient costs. When patient misdiagnosis costs are 
partially covered, GHs may choose to increase their share of misdiagnosed patient costs voluntarily, 
aiming for increased profits. (2) A threshold exists for the CHC share of misdiagnosed patient costs: 
below this threshold, increasing the CHC share of misdiagnosed patient costs promotes referral of 
online patients to CHCs and attracts more initial patients into the system, yet it leads to higher total 
social costs and patient crowding; Whereas, above the threshold, as CHCs share of misdiagnosed 
patient costs increases, the total societal cost rises, GH's initial patient arrival rate and profits decline. 
It is advisable to maintain the share of misdiagnosed patient costs of CHCs within a low range. 
Higher ratios for CHCs not only impose a heavier financial burden on the government but also 
diminish patient accessibility and undermine the interests of GHs. (3) When the government budget 
is small (i.e., the government budget is less than a certain threshold), increasing investment in 
capacity for CHCs does not effectively improve system performance, including patient waiting, 
arrival rate, or GH profit; when the government budget is high (i.e., the government budget is higher 
than a certain threshold), increasing investment in capacity for CHCs can effectively improve 
accessibility to healthcare services and increase medical resource utilization efficiency, and can 
bring higher profits to GHs, but it may result in higher service price for patient. Hence, when facing 
budget constraints, the government should refrain from allocating funds toward the service capacity 
of CHCs. Conversely, when adequate funds are available, the government should allocate more 
resources to enhance the service capacity of CHCs. 
The study did not account for the complexity of patient diseases. In future research, patient 
disease complexity could be considered with its impact on patients' decisions and the hospital 
misdiagnosis rate. Additionally, the study did not consider the influence of different health 
insurance payment methods on the system. Comparing the optimal differentiated subsidy strategies 
of the government and the system's equilibrium performance under various health insurance 
payment methods，this could offer valuable insights in the context of the Internet healthcare and

could improve healthcare alliance efficiency.

Appendix 
Proof of Proposition 1 
The association of Equation (7) with Equation (8) yields： 
(𝛽−1)𝑃+ 𝑃0 = 𝑔(𝜇2) (𝑉−𝜆2𝑒
𝜇2
) + (1 −𝑔(𝜇2))((𝛽−1 + 𝑥1 + 𝑥2)𝑃+ 𝑃0 −𝑉
𝑚). 
The collation is obtained by bringing λ2e = g(𝜇2)(λ2f + λ2r) into the above equation: 
𝜆2𝑟
∗
=
𝜇2
𝑔(𝜇2) (𝑉−𝐴1𝑃−𝐴0𝑉
𝑚−𝑃0) −𝜆2𝑓. 
Where, 𝐴1 = (𝛽−1 −(
1
𝑔(𝜇2) −1)(𝑥1 + 𝑥2)), 𝐴0 = (
1
𝑔(𝜇2) −1). 
Due to 𝜆𝑟= 𝜆1𝑟+𝜆2𝑟, we have 
𝜆1𝑟
∗= 𝜆𝑟+ 𝜆2𝑓−
𝜇2
𝑔(𝜇2) (𝑉−𝐴1𝑃−𝐴0𝑉
𝑚−𝑃0), 
Bringing 𝜆1𝑟
∗ and λ1e = λ1f + λ1r + (1 −g(𝜇2))(λ2f + λ2r) into Equation (7) yields 
𝜆1𝑓
∗
= (𝜇1 + 𝜇2)𝑉−(𝜇1𝛽+ 𝜇2𝐴1)𝑃−𝜇2𝑃0 −𝜇2𝐴0𝑉
𝑚−𝜆𝑟−𝜆2𝑓. 
Proof of Proposition 2 
When (𝑥1 + 𝑥2) <
𝛽−1
(

𝜕𝜆1𝑓

𝜕𝑃> 0, 
𝜕𝜆2𝑟

𝜕𝑃< 0. The converse is 
also true. 
Proof of Proposition 3 
According to Proposition 1, the CHC objective function at this point is obtained: 
𝑚𝑎𝑥
𝜇2 𝜆2e
∗= 𝜇2(𝑉−𝐴1𝑃−𝐴0𝑉
𝑚−𝑃0).

The first order derivative of 𝜆2e

Journal Pre-proof
Because 𝜆2𝑟
∗
≥0，i.e. 
𝜇2
𝑔(𝜇2) (𝑉−𝐴1𝑃−𝐴0𝑉
𝑚−𝑃0) −𝜆2𝑓≥0, 
We have (𝑉−𝐴1𝑃−𝐴0𝑉
𝑚−𝑃0) ≥0, meanwhile 𝜇2[𝑎𝑒𝑎𝜇2+𝑏(𝑥1 + 𝑥2)𝑃+ 𝑒𝑎𝜇2+𝑏𝑉
𝑚] >
0 
From this, we can conclude that 
𝜕𝜆2𝑒
∗
𝜕𝜇2 > 0. The effective community hospital arrival rate 𝜆2e

increases with 𝜇2. Therefore, we have 𝜇2
∗=

𝐶𝜇2.

Carrying 𝜆2𝑟

𝜕2𝜋
𝜕𝑃2 = −2(𝜇1𝛽2 + 𝑁𝐴1𝐴2). 
Where，𝐴2 = (𝛽−1 −𝐴0𝑥1). Let 𝐴3 = 𝜇1𝛽2 + 𝑁𝐴1𝐴2. 
Because 𝜇1 > 𝜇2, 𝛽> 𝐴1, 𝛽> 𝐴2. Therefore, 𝐴3 > 0. 
𝜕2𝜋
𝜕𝑃2 < 0, 𝜋(𝑃) is concave in 𝑃.  
By making 
𝜕𝜋
𝜕𝑃= 0, we can get service price 𝑃

The dominance of an innovation discourse laden with cutting edge and expensive technologies, may be pre­
venting us from recognizing alternative and complementary perspectives, which could help cut healthcare costs 
while improving worldwide access to health services. One such complementary approach is that of frugal 
innovation. Frugal innovation, as a way to produce efficacious and affordable products using fewer resources to 
reach the underserved customers, has received increasing attention in the social sciences literature. Although 
frugal innovation is commonly associated with emerging economies, there is now a rising interest from 
healthcare providers in developed countries, to find and apply effective, and lower-cost solutions. Nonetheless, 
knowledge on frugal innovation and its role in healthcare is dispersed across different literatures which hampers 
researchers and practitioners to access a fuller, and integrated picture of the phenomenon. In this study, by 
synthesizing extant knowledge, we tackle the fragmentation of the phenomenon. We elucidate on who the actors 
are, what is being done, how are such innovations being developed, and what the outcomes are, providing a 
framework that lays out the underlying mechanisms of frugal innovation in healthcare (FIH). The midrange 
theory that we develop, provides a conceptual framework for researchers to undertake empirical observation and 
models to guide managerial practices. Furthermore, by providing a more unified perspective of frugal innovation 
in healthcare, we hope to initiate conversations on the development, adequacy and adoption of these innovations 
in healthcare services, which could increase affordability and access for the population while maintaining 
quality.   
1. Introduction 
Healthcare systems and technologies have evolved tremendously 
over the last decades, with marked improvements in healthcare delivery, 
and successful containment of many diseases. The development of vac­
cines and pharmaceuticals which have enabled the conquest of once- 
devastating illnesses such as smallpox and polio, and the better under­
standing of underlying mechanisms causing many diseases, has led to a 
marked improvement in our ability to prevent, diagnose, and treat 
common afflictions such as diabetes and heart diseases (Institute of 
Medicine, 2008). These, and other advances, have contributed towards 
the increase of the average global life expectancy at birth, by 5.5 years 
between 2000 and 2016, and the reduction in mortality of children 
under the age of five in low-income countries by 53 per cent (WHO, 
2020a). Yet, critical problems remain. Only about one-third to one-half 
of the global population is covered by essential health services, and if 
this trend continues, these numbers are expected to remain between 39 
and 63 per cent in 2030, and even lower in poor countries (United Na­
tions, 2020). Resource constraints in healthcare systems in low and 
middle-income countries (LMICs) (Prime et al., 2017; Dessap, 2019), 
and financial barriers to care (such as user fees) for both public and 
private systems imply its limited access to the citizens of these countries, 
especially in rural areas (Basu et al., 2012; Gu et al., 2009 and references 
therein). High-income countries (HICs) also face multiple challenges due 
to slower economic growth, high healthcare systems costs, and an 
increasingly aging society (Halfmann et al., 2019; Prime et al., 2017). 
The COVID-19 pandemic has put further strains on healthcare systems 
globally, reinforcing urgent calls to find new and less expensive 
healthcare solutions (Sarkar, 2021; United Nations, 2020). 
Historically, medical innovations have been important drivers in the 
improvement of healthcare systems. Yet these innovations, such as so­
phisticated and complex medical devices, albeit not the sole responsible,

have also contributed towards augmented costs in healthcare services. 
For instance, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) unit may cost from 2 
to 8 million dollars which is likely to strain the health budgets in LMICs 
where even more standard equipment such as an anesthesia machine 
(US$ 5000) may be difficult to acquire (WHO, 2010, and references 
therein). As medical devices are often developed for resource-endowed 
social contexts of HICs, they are frequently not affordable, useful, or 
appropriate to be used in resource-constrained settings, thus intensi­
fying health disparities between different countries, as well as between 
social groups (Dessap, 2019; Lehoux et al., 2016, and references therein; 
Valiathan, 2018). Confronted with these and other inefficiencies, 
healthcare leaders have been working globally on improving the quality 
of their services while reducing costs and promoting inclusivity (Bianchi 
et al., 2017; Prime et al., 2017). The dominance of an innovation 
discourse laden with research and development (R&D) investments, and 
cutting edge and expensive technologies, may be preventing us from 
recognizing alternative and complementary perspectives to achieve 
effective healthcare solutions. Although innovation trends have been 
moving from being science-led fueled by technological advances, to also 
include a more a practice-based innovation approach powered by "re­
sources at hand" (Farchi and Salge, 2017; Ess´
en and Lindblad, 2013), 
inclusivity remains a problem to be tackled. One complementary way, 
which could contribute towards providing effective, affordable and in­
clusive solutions in healthcare systems, is through frugal innovation 
(FI). 
When actors are faced with resource constraints, they can trigger 
cost-effective, and good-enough quality solutions (Gibbert et al., 2014; 
Lim and Fujimoto, 2019). Innovations emerging from resource con­
strained contexts, are deemed as being “frugal”, often involving adap­
tations and reengineering of pre-existing technologies (Sarkar and 
Pansera, 2017). While the definition of FI depends on the perspective 
(Bhatti et al., 2017), it has generally been understood to be “low-cost 
and efficacious, new or adapted products (or services), mostly emerging 
from contexts of institutional voids and resource constraints, involving 
the creative use of existing resources” (Sarkar, 2021, p.2). FI is based on 
strategies of “doing more with less for more” (Prabhu, 2017, p.1), 
creating value by using less resources and for more people. While 
technological advances and innovations have been mostly associated 
with HICs, there has been an increasing number of LMICs, especially in 
Asia, which have been transitioning towards innovation-driven econo­
mies (Liu et al., 2019). LMICs are becoming not only important as 
consumers, but also as producers, shifting the gravitational center of 
global economic activity (Ghauri et al., 2021). Innovations emerging 
from these contexts tend to be less resource-intensive, more robust, as 
well as more affordable (Tiwari and Herstatt, 2012). Although the FI 
phenomenon has been mainly associated with LMICs, FIs with “char­
acteristics of reframing constraints, bridging access, and enacting new 
business models” (Lim and Fujimoto, 2019, p.1017), are now recognized 
to be also important for HICs (European Commission, 2016; Lim and 
Fujimoto, 2019). Furthermore, some of these innovations “adopted first 
in poor (emerging) economies before ’trickling up’ to rich countries” 
(Govindarajan and Ramamurti, 2011, p.191) represent a flow of inno­
vation transferred from LMICs to HICs, referred to as reverse innovation 
(RI). An example of RI in healthcare is the General Electric (GE) ultra­
sound machine, first marketed in China but which was later found to be 
efficient enough to be marketed in HICs such as the USA, where it is 
used, for instance, in emergency units and ambulances. (Hossain et al., 
2016; Zeschky et al., 2011). More recently, the development of FI has 
shown to be an important contributor in the tackling of the COVID-19 
pandemic (Harris et al., 2020; Sarkar, 2021), further stimulating inter­
est on FI by scholars and practitioners. 
As the idea of innovations arising out of resource-poor contexts is 
based on a different paradigm compared to the R&D driven innovation 
discourse today, it attracts scholarly interest (Hang et al., 2010; Praha­
lad, 2012; Sarkar and Pansera, 2017). Researchers have also started to 
examine healthcare innovations emerging from such contexts. FI in 
healthcare (FIH) from LMICs, which potentially combine cost and 
resource appropriateness concerns, yet geared towards performance or 
effectiveness, promise a cheaper, alternative, and complementary 
strategy for many countries. For instance, the development of FIH 
products by hospitals and physicians in LMICs which often struggle to 
acquire standard equipment, has been studied by some authors (Bianchi 
et al., 2017; Hossain, 2017). In the COVID-19 pandemic context, Sarkar 
(2021) highlights some innovations that are low-cost, but still provided 
effective and complementary defensive aids in the fight against the 
pandemic in the Indian state of Kerala. Corsini et al. (2020) also pre­
sented the example of the rapid development of face-shields in the 
Maker’s Asylum in Mumbai. 
Being an emerging research field, researchers are only now begin­
ning to enquire into FIH. Notable scholarly efforts have recently 
contributed with qualitative studies. However, these studies are 
dispersed across different literature fields, and in particular in medicine 
and management (see Appendix A). As the two research fields often 
remain distinct, our understanding of the phenomenon thus remain 
fragmented. Moreover, qualitative studies often do not provide enough 
basis for generalizations (Eisenhardt, 1989). Therefore, by remaining 
isolated, the opportunity to inform researchers and practiotioners 
through knowledge accumulation and robust generalizations is 
hampered (Habersang et al., 2019). Hence, for this emerging research 
area to sink stronger roots, there is much to gain from a more integrated 
understanding of FIH. Such appreciation should ideally synthesize the 
main empirical contributions from both research streams, and also 
elucidate on who the actors are, what is being done, how are such in­
novations being developed, as well as identifying the outcomes. In this 
paper, we seek to provide a foundation for future studies to examine FIH. 
Towards this, we synthesize extant knowledge (Jaakkola, 2020), 
focusing on empirical cases to discuss the phenomenon’s distinctive 
features, explicating higher-order constructs by subsuming the phe­
nomenon’s complexity (Cornelissen, 2017), to reveal the mechanisms by 
which FIH unfolds. We provide a framework unifying the higher order 
dimensions we have considered: the actors (“who”), motivations 
(“why”), process (“how”) and outcomes (“what”), to provide a more 
complete and enhanced analysis of the phenomenon (Buckley and Pra­
shantham, 2016; Page and Vella-Brodrick, 2009; Prilleltensky, 2012; 
Secundo et al., 2021). We adopt a narrative idiom to explain FIH around 
a generalized process mechanism, as the underlying storyline (Langley, 
1999). The midrange theory that we therefore develop, provides a 
conceptual guide for the development of new theoretical perspectives, 
and for researchers to undertake empirical observation and models to 
guide managerial practices (Jaakkola, 2020). 
We begin our narrative by situating the current background on the 
concept of FI (section 2). In section 3, we present and describe our 
framework regarding the phenomenon’s antecedents, process, and 
outcomes. In section 4, we discuss the study’s main contributions for 
research, practice and society. Finally, in section 5, the main limitations 
of this study are outlined along with suggestions on future research 
directions. 
2. Conceptual background of frugal innovation 
The frugal innovation concept has its roots in the “appropriate 
technology” movement (Kaplinsky, 2011; Schumacher, 1973) which 
called for the employment of “technologies which are appropriate for 
low-income countries in that they are labour-intensive, simple to oper­
ate and repair, producing products for low-income consumers” 
(Kaplinsky, 2011, p.195). The relevance of the potential to innovate 
using few resources, follows the recognition by scholars that the inno­
vation potential may be even bigger in LMICs, where markets are bigger 
and less saturated, and where “surprising ways of using current inno­
vation or out-dated technologies in new ways can be found” (Sarkar and 
Pansera, 2017, p.328). This suggests that especially in a resource con­
strained world, there exists an enormous potential for innovations to be

of a low-cost and “frugal” nature (Sarkar and Pansera, 2017). Over the 
last decade, the FI concept has gained increasing popularity amongst 
practitioners and innovation scholars alike. Wooldridge, writing in The 
Economist (2010), noted that when it comes to FI, “There is more to this 
than simply cutting costs to the bone (…). Frugal innovation is not just 
about redesigning products; it involves rethinking entire production 
processes and business models” (pp.3–4). While efforts have been car­
ried out in the search for a consensual definition (Bhatti and Ventresca, 
2012; Hossain, 2018; Pisoni et al., 2018; Weyrauch and Herstatt, 2016), 
there is a broad understanding that FI aims at serving the needs of the 
underserved populations by providing robust, low-cost but efficient 
solutions. With initial research trends tending to focus on FI in the 
resource constrained environments of LMICs, it is now emerging as a 
more global phenomenon, and increasingly finding relevance in HICs 
(Bhatti et al., 2017; Kroll and Gabriel, 2020; Pisoni et al., 2018 and 
references therein). Extant innovation discourse tends to follow a Silicon 
Valley bias, with a focus on creation of new technologies fueled by R&D, 
and has been criticized for its “western techno-fetishism of novelty” 
(Keane and Zhao, 2012, p.223). FI therefore provides an alternative and 
complementary dimension to this dominant narrative, one that emerges 
from resource-poor economies. As the discussion around FI moves from 
LMIC to HIC settings (e.g., European Commission, 2017; Lim and Fuji­
moto, 2019; Weyrauch and Herstatt, 2016), this phenomenon makes a 
case for what richer countries can learn from the poor. 
Current FI management research goes beyond innovation studies, 
embracing areas such as entrepreneurship (Hossain and Sarkar, 2021), 
sustainability (Khan, 2016; Pansera and Sarkar, 2016; Rosca et al., 2017; 
Tesfaye and Foug`
ere, 2021), and more recently in healthcare (Bianchi 
et al., 2017; Corsini et al., 2020; Winterhalter et al., 2017; Sarkar, 2021). 
Furthermore, there is an increased recognition that being frugal does not 
necessarily mean creating products which sacrifice on performance 
levels (Sarkar, 2021; Weyrauch and Herstatt, 2016). For instance, 
Weyrauch and Herstatt (2016) consider that FI not only shares the two 
more generally recognized frugal attributes of substantial cost reduc­
tion, and concentration on core functionalities, but can also imply 
optimized performance level. This recognition of “optimal performance” 
has shifted the debate of FI not only being centered on low price, but that 
FI can also imply high quality, ease of use, and robustness (Lim and 
Fujimoto, 2019; Rao, 2013; Sarkar, 2021; Zeschky et al., 2011; Weyr­
auch, 2018). We argue that this re-examination of FI as geared towards 
performance or effectiveness, is therefore also very relevant when it 
comes to FIH, which potentially combine cost and resource appropri­
ateness concerns, with function analysis which “focuses on what func­
tions must be included in an object in order to fulfil the requirements 
placed on the object” (VDI, 2019, p. 3, as cited in Winkler et al., 2020). 
3. Frugal innovation in healthcare (FIH) 
Our explanation of the phenomenon follows a qualitative evidence 
synthesis often used to synthesize complex interventions, and ideal for 
studying processes (Combs et al., 2019; Rauch et al., 2014). Using 
qualitative means, we are able to better appreciate the richness of the 
FIH phenomena, by considering their relational and temporal contexts 
(Garud et al., 2018). The qualitative evidence we synthesize was 
extracted from empirical data or case studies in extant literature, pub­
lished in both medicine related and management journals. From this 
analysis, we arrive at FIH’s higher-order constructs that help us to 
subsume the phenomenon’s complexity (Furnari et al., 2020), provi­
sioning its more complete and enhanced analysis (Buckley and Pra­
shantham, 2016; Page and Vella-Brodrick, 2009; Prilleltensky, 2012; 
Secundo et al., 2021). We organize our explanation using a narrative 
methodology (Elliot, 2005) that informs the progression of ideas around 
four broad themes of FIH incidence: actors (who?) embedded in a 
description of what is FIH; the antecedents (why?); process (how?); 
outcomes (what?). 
Before delving into the narrative which synthesizes and integrates 
the qualitative and empirical data found, we present the conceptual 
framework that distil the progression of ideas of the antecedents, pro­
cesses, and outcomes of FI in healthcare (Fig. 1). These are connected as 
a process, which has a combinatorial logic that enables us to understand 
how the “different elements of the configuration relate to one another to 
produce the outcome in an analytical way” (Park et al., 2020, p.9). In the 
next subsection, we initiate the narrative by defining and describing 
FIH. We then characterize FIH along the four themes defined, com­
plementing the narrative with some real case examples. 
3.1. What is FIH? 
We define FIH as a resource parsimonious innovation process, to 
produce appropriate and efficacious healthcare related goods or ser­
vices, at low costs and implicating the creative use of existing resources. 
FIH not only harbours the promise of low-cost innovations, but it also 
involves more open platforms with the participation and collaboration 
of varied actors as we shall defend. FIH as a research field is still 
incipient, with scholars recently contributing with qualitative studies, 
frequently in medical (and related) journals (e.g. Bhatti et al., 2017; 
O’Hara, 2015; Valiathan, 2018).1 To aggregate information on what FIH 
may mean, Arshad et al. (2018) reviewed extant literature to identify 
patterns of FI in healthcare regarding the type of innovators and in­
novations, the country of origin and first launch market, type of care, 
and geographical diffusion. These authors were then able to provide an 
overview of these characteristics mainly relying on percentage analysis. 
Another effort at aggregating evidence was that of Tran and Ravaud 
(2016), who classified FIH according to the technological complexity of 
the devices and the developers’ context in a reverse relationship, 
implying that solutions based on simpler technologies are “homegrown” 
with more complex technologies involved when developed in richer 
contexts. These authors suggest the following four subtypes of FIH 
(ranging from lower to higher technological complexity) - Bottom-up 
innovations, contextualized adaptations, opportunistic solutions, and 
lean tool and techniques. While these attempts at aggregating evidence 
provide a summary outlook on the characteristics of FIH, we remain 
ignorant on the phenomenon’s mechanisms explaining events and out­
comes. Our study takes a further step in opening the area for future 
studies, by providing a conceptual background and then extracting key 
higher order dimensions of the concept, to produce an integrative view 
of the phenomenon. 
FIH encompasses a wide range of solutions, which are consistently 
low-cost, and of an adequate performance level to serve the underserved 
populations. While authors consider that FI can comprise of products, 
services, processes, or business models (Hossain et al., 2016; Prabhu, 
2017), most FI studies have however concentrated on products. Our FIH 
analysis is similarly focused on frugal products as a boundary condition, 
for two reasons. First, the development and implementation of health­
care products are different from the other types of innovations, which 
makes it difficult to explore each one in detail in the same body of work. 
Second, it gives us an opportunity to aggregate and conceptually discuss 
an emerging yet fragmented literature, and by using a homogenous 
group it enables us to gather more valid and relevant research findings 
(Lee et al., 2013). 
3.2. FIH innovation types and the actors 
Frugal products in healthcare include preventive tools, diagnostic 
and monitoring tools, surgical tools, and therapeutic or rehabilitative 
devices. Fig. 2 presents a set of examples of each one. In FIH, main­
taining a certain level of quality and efficiency is a top priority, with the

cases of FIH, which have contributed towards constructing our integrative view 
of the phenomenon.

objective “to provide safe healthcare in the best way possible under 
given circumstances and constraints” (Harris et al., 2020, p.814). 
A diverse range of actors from both HICs and LMICs can be involved 
in the development of FIH, including multinational companies (MNCs), 
local entrepreneurs, startups, small and medium-sized enterprises 
(SMEs), social enterprises, healthcare workers, hospitals and other 
healthcare centers, universities, and research institutes. In this section, 
we elaborate on a few examples to illustrate the diversity of actors 
developing FIH. We then summarize (Table 1) a broader set of examples 
of FIH and its actors. These and other examples are further explored 
regarding the associated motivations, processes, and outcomes in the 
subsequent sections of this paper. 
Some MNCs from HICs have been engaging in FI for healthcare for 
some time. For instance, GE has produced a frugal ultrasound machine, 
an electrocardiogram (ECG) device, and a baby warmer, while Siemens 
developed a frugal computerized tomography (CT) scanner, and a fetal 
heart rate monitor. These devices are not only cheaper than their stan­
dard equivalents but were developed taking into consideration the 
rough conditions of use in the target market (LMICs) being adjusted to 
be used in those settings (Agarwal and Brem, 2012; Hossain, 2017; 
Zeschky et al., 2011). While most of the examples found, begin by tar­
geting LMICs, some have shown to be good-enough to later penetrate 
HICs markets (RI) (Agarwal and Brem, 2012; Zeschky et al., 2011). For 
instance, Siemens’s X-ray machine MultiSelect DR costs around 30 per c 
less than their equivalent high-end products, and still has sufficient 
quality to comply with most standards in HICs. Therefore, it is not only

marketed in LMICs but also used in HICs mainly as backup equipment 
(Agarwal and Brem, 2012). 
FI in healthcare can arise from the local needs, provoking user-actors 
to craft innovative solutions. The Jaipur Foot is a low-cost prosthetic 
limb created by the Indian doctor P.K. Sethi, for barefoot amputees. The 
product is manufactured by local artisans using readily available ma­
terials (Grover et al., 2014). This is an example where physicians, who 
understand real needs and conditions in healthcare of the local popu­
lation, become active actors in FIH. Sethi observed that amputees would 
rather use crutches than prostheses fitted with a Solid Ankle Cushion 
Heel foot (SACH), as these were unsuitable for “floor-sitting” lifestyle in 
the hot and humid conditions of India (Arya and Klenerman, 2008). 
Another example of FIH developed by physicians is the ShakerScope, a 
light source for eye, ear and throat examination which produces power 
by shaking and was developed by two anesthesiologists from Morriston 
Hospital in Swansea, United Kingdom. The doctors were inspired to 
create a device which does not require electricity or battery, as they 
observed first-hand in Zambia that most conventional devices did not 
work due to erratic electrical power, which is common in many LMICs 
(Mandal, 2014). 
FIH can also be stimulated by governments and hospitals policies. 
This is the case of an Uruguayan hospital, where in cooperation with 
local partners, a neuronavigation device and a human milk pasteurizer 
were developed. These innovation processes were enabled by using 
embedded local capacities to creatively use the available resources, 
aiming at surpassing technology access barriers to improve the desired 
service quality at lower costs (Bianchi et al., 2017). Universities and 
research institutes are another great source of FIH, and while they often 
lack support (Mandal, 2014), there are some successful cases such as the 
Pumani bubbleCPAP which is a low-cost respiratory support device 
designed by the research institute Rice360 at Rice University, USA (Tran 
and Ravaud, 2016; Prime et al., 2017). Moreover, since FIH “reduces the 
need for sophisticated labs and instead relies on clever brainstorming 
and a better grasp of basic engineering skills”, students can be stimu­
lated to pursue on innovation and entrepreneurship paths even in less 
well-equipped facilities (Mandal, 2014, p.12). 
3.3. Motivations for FIH 
We locate three key antecedents that motivate the development of 
FIH - healthcare system inefficiencies, keeping up with low-cost com­
petitors and targeting new markets, and time constraints, each of which 
we now discuss below. 
3.3.1. Inefficiencies in healthcare systems due to high costs and/or limited 
availability 
The need for FIH is intrinsically connected to extant inefficiencies in 
healthcare systems worldwide. Due to spiraling healthcare costs, high- 
tech medical devices, and unavailability/inadequacy of these devices 
to be used in resource-constrained environments, quality healthcare 
services are not available for one third to one half of the global popu­
lation (WHO, 2020a). Access to quality and appropriate healthcare is a 
major society concern, being imperative to find ways to provide uni­
versal access to quality healthcare services and tackle the existent dis­
parities (Bianchi et al., 2017; Crisp, 2014; Lehoux et al., 2016; WHO, 
2020a). This is one great motivator for FIH and in virtually all cases we 
have come across during our research, we find that there exists a desire 
to address this dimension of healthcare failure to some degree. 
The trigger for the enaction of FIH may be identified by healthcare 
institutions and professionals themselves when faced with constraints 
such as lack of financial resources to acquire standard tools and equip­
ment. These and other constraints cause limited availability of health­
care products which may stimulate users (for instance, healthcare 
professionals) to craft “demand induced innovations” (Bianchi et al., 
2017, p.75). This has been happening since before the FI concept was 
even formulated, as was the case of the TTK-Chitra heart valve, which 
was conceived by a team of health professionals in the 1980s when it 
became impossible to import cardiac valves to meet the demands for the 
Chitra Medical Center, which offered free cardiac and neurological 
services to poor patients in India (Valiathan, 2018). The two must-have 
conditions of the cardiac valve for its developers, were affordability and 
compliance with ISO standards. After partnering with other institutions 
in India, and after a series of trial and error, the valve achieved those 
conditions and has been successful implanted in over 130,000 patients 
(Valiathan, 2018; TTK Healthcare, 2021). Similarly, in the search to 
provide universal access to quality health services, Tacuaremb´
o Hospital 
in Uruguay has been able to use the available scarce resources to develop 
good quality frugal products. For instance, a team of hospital surgeons 
and engineers of a local university were able to develop a neuro­
navigation system which is simpler and more affordable than commer­
cialized ones. Formerly, neuronavigation had not been yet used in the 
country due to its high cost (Bianchi et al., 2017). This therefore pro­
vided the means to enable local patients to access a technology which is 
available worldwide. 
The desire to provide effective and low-cost solutions to improve the 
quality and availability of healthcare systems in LMICs, or other 
resource-constrained environments, can also come from actors in HICs, 
as we have previously seen in the case of the ShakerScope (Mandal, 
2014). Another FIH product comes from a small company based at the

University of British Columbia in Canada, which developed a solution to 
tackle the unavailability of surgical drills in LMICs due to high costs. 
Since a surgical drill can cost around $30,000, surgeons often choose to 
use unsterile hardware drills to treat fractures, thus bearing a high risk of 
infection (Prime et al., 2017). The FIH solution is a drill cover system 
costing around $400 and composed of two sterilizable parts allowing for 
low-cost non-surgical drills to be used safely (O’Hara, 2015). 
3.3.2. Keeping up with low-cost competitors and targeting new markets 
Ventures may initiate FI processes to compete with low-cost prod­
ucts. For instance, GE developed an ultrasound machine for resource- 
constrained market segments after realizing that low-cost competitors 
from emerging economies were beginning to gain market share. Later, 
the company adapted its strategy to also commercialize its FI products in 
HICs (Zeschky et al., 2011). Similarly, with the objective to compete 
with local manufacturers and to gain market share in LMICs, Siemens 
created and engaged in a SMART initiative to develop frugal products 
which are “simple, maintainable, affordable, reliable and timely to 
market”, some of them in the healthcare field. Examples of these include 
an X-ray machine and a fetal heart rate monitor (Agarwal and Brem, 
2012). Philips is another company which engaged in FIH to offer a 
bedside patient monitoring system and replace the low-cost competitors 
in Chinese hospitals (Zeschky et al., 2011). To succeed in developing 
appropriate FIH for specific target markets such as LMICs, these MNCs 
often opt to deploy the development process and manufacture to local 
subsidiaries involving local teams which have or more easily gain the 
knowledge about the real conditions in which the product will be used, 
which is an essential step to assure adherence by the market (Winter­
halter et al., 2017; Zeschky et al., 2011). 
3.3.3. Crises and time constraints 
Health crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic, may trigger FIH, when 
lack of time and resources emerge as critical constraints. The need to 
develop tools to monitor and manage the spread of diseases, aligned 
with the shortage of medical supplies and personal protection equip­
ment was a global reality during the onset of COVID-19 pandemic. 
Citizens, ventures, and governments, both in LMICs and HICs, were 
forced to rapidly engage in ways to overcome this global problem, 
including FIH solutions (Corsini et al., 2020; Harris et al., 2020; Sarkar, 
2021; Vesci et al., 2021). For instance, an Italian startup, Isinnova was 
able to rapidly develop valves for ventilators in collaboration with 
hospitals and a scuba dive masks manufacturer. Due to the magnitude of 
the pandemic, and the need to exponentially ramp up supply, the ven­
ture decided to make their patent design available so it could be man­
ufactured elsewhere (Corsini et al., 2020; Vesci et al., 2021). The 
development of frugal diagnostic point-of-care-tests (performed in 
nonlaboratory settings) at a patient’s bedside has become important 
during the pandemic as it allows reducing “extensive waiting times and 
unnecessary treatments and enable effective containment measures” 
(Miesler et al., 2020). Since crisis contexts obligate entrepreneurs to act 
fast to build and apply efficacious solutions, it represents an opportunity 
for HICs to gain knowledge and provide validation on the effectiveness 
of FI products, which is still mainly used in LMICs contexts. This could 
possibly and hopefully contribute to open up space for global knowledge 
and technology transfer (in the form, for instance, of RI – see outcomes’ 
subsection), which could disrupt how innovation in healthcare occurs 
(Harris et al., 2020). 
3.4. How? The process of FIH 
We found the process development of FIH to rest on three main 
pillars – focusing on design and performance, resource optimization and 
cost minimization, and cooperation. We next discuss each of these. 
3.4.1. Focus on design, functionality, and performance optimization 
FIH goes beyond delivering low-cost and lower quality versions of 
Western products and services (Economist, 2010; Kuo, 2017; Zeschky 
et al., 2011). Instead, the solution “is refined to its maximum to answer 
precisely the need without concession on quality, but without super­
fluous addition” while aiming at affordability (Dessap, 2019, p.253). 
This is done by keeping in mind the contexts and constraints of the users. 
Constraints may be of diverse nature such as unreliable transport and 
electricity structures, lack of technically skilled workforce, issues on 
data connectivity and weak infrastructures (Mandal, 2014; Miesler 
et al., 2020). To develop products with adequate characteristics and 
performance, while maintaining low prices, developers of FIH pursue 
different strategies such as design simplification and maintaining focus 
on core functionalities. For instance, detection devices for infectious 
diseases in central laboratories and large hospitals are fully automated, 
operated under sterile environments and processing more than 300 
samples in 6 to 8 hours. The case is different in rural scenarios, where it 
is more important for people to get quickly tested and treated and there 
are no infrastructural conditions or specialized people to operate these 
devices. Therefore, when a Dutch MNC decided to develop similar 
equipment for China and rural LMIC areas, they simplified the design 
allowing it to be used by less skilled personnel. It featured a single 
button and displayed the results in a very intuitive manner: green 
smileys for not infected, red smileys for infected (Winterhalter et al., 
2017). 
Simplifications for cost reduction can sometimes be achieved by 
substituting high-end technologies for simpler ones, such as in the case 
of Siemens’ fetal heart rate monitor which incorporates simple micro­
phones instead of expensive ultrasound technology, while also elimi­
nating the cost of specialized personnel to operate the device (Kesavan 
and Dy, 2020). Nevertheless, simplification does not always imply that 
more recent technology was not used. The difference between FIH and 
conventional innovation in these cases, is that to keep costs low, func­
tions are pared down to the essentials (Bianchi et al., 2017; Kuo, 2017). 
This means FIH can still feature high-end technologies, yet with fewer 
non-essential functions or simpler architectures, as in the case of the GE 
ultrasound machine or the Siemens CT scanner (Zeschky et al., 2011). 
FIH can moreover be the enabler for physicians and patients in 
resource-constrained settings to access high-end technology, such as the 
neuronavigation system developed in Tacuaremb´
o Hospital in Uruguay 
(Bianchi et al., 2017). 
There are other important features to be considered in the develop­
ment of FIH, namely robustness and portability. Since many FI products 
are often designed to be used in rural areas, they must be transported 
through rough roads and used in less-than-ideal infrastructural condi­
tions. These two features are often considered by developers of FIH, such 
as GE for their ultrasound device, or the Peek Vision for their portable 
eye examination kit (Zeschky et al., 2011; Prime et al., 2017) For 
example, being able to work under extreme weather conditions such as 
humidity and high temperature is an important feature for a FIH prod­
ucts (Winterhalter et al., 2017; Agarwal et al., 2021). Hence, when 
designing their detection devices for infectious diseases, which in stan­
dard conditions in HICs are operated under temperature-controlled en­
vironments, the Dutch MNC made sure it was able to work not only in a 
hot and humid temperature but also under temperature variations of the 
sample without compromising the result (Winterhalter et al., 2017). 
Additionally, ease of use and maintenance are also important fea­
tures to be incorporated in FIH products, as they are likely to be handled 
by less-experienced personnel in environments which are often too poor 
to perform maintenance of the equipment (Gupta and Thomke, 2018). 
Indeed, these are two of the most relevant characteristics noted by 
doctors, immediately after affordability, as observed by Agarwal et al. 
(2018) in their study on the differences and similarities of the top pri­
orities for healthcare innovative products in India. UE LifeSciences, an 
USA-Indian venture realized, while developing a prescreening device for 
breast cancer (iBreastExam), that the ratio of radiologists in their target 
market (India) was extremely low – one radiologist per 100,000 people 
(in the USA there is one per 10,000). Therefore, the developers had to

focus on “low-resource providers” in local communities when designing 
the device to make in easy to use and decided that a one-button-design 
(on/off) without screens would be the most appropriate for the target 
user group, transferring the remaining functions to a mobile app 
(Agarwal et al., 2021). Lack of maintenance support in rural areas was 
similarly identified by GE as an important constraint during their 
development of the baby warmer. GE discovered that one important 
maintenance issue was the frequent replacement of the light bulb, which 
is critical for the machine’s operation. To overcome this, they used LED 
lamps instead to increase longevity and reduce maintenance need, and 
while this increased the price of the product, the total cost of ownership 
was reduced (Agarwal et al., 2021). 
3.4.2. Resource optimization and cost minimization 
Resource optimization is an essential dynamic in FIH, given that the 
phenomenon mostly emerges from contexts that are resource- 
constrained, while also enabling to keep costs low. As resources in our 
context, we consider the following: financial, technology and materials, 
personnel, time, and infrastructure (Dessap, 2019). Actors focus on 
reducing costs along all stages: R&D, supply chain, manufacturing, and 
sales (Winterhalter et al., 2017). Savings in R&D by MNCs for instance, 
are often achieved by relying on local engineers and workers in the 
target market location (often LMICs). This strategy was used by GE 
regarding its frugal ultrasound machine. The product was developed in 
the company’s Chinese subsidiary not only to take advantage of lower 
labor costs, but also to leverage the embedded knowledge possessed by 
the local team (Zeschky et al., 2011). One Dutch company, for instance, 
designed their frugal diagnostic tool mostly in their headquarters, and 
then outsourced its development to firms specialized in minimizing 
costs, since the team lacked low-cost developmental capabilities (Win­
terhalter et al., 2017). 
Two other ways to optimize resources and performance, as well as 
reducing costs involve (1) using technologies which had been developed 
earlier and are then adjusted or repurposed (2) by decomposing multi- 
purpose machines into single operation devices (Winterhalter et al., 
2017). Extant technologies and components can contribute towards the 
creation of medical low-cost products. These include 3D printing, 
miniaturization, artificial intelligence, cloud computing, lab-on-a-chip 
techniques, and components from mobile and microelectronics in­
dustry (Brem, 2017; Lundin and Dumont, 2017; Prime et al., 2017). For 
instance, PEEK, a portable eye examination kit, relies on a smartphone 
application and a lens adapter. PEEK enables capturing images which 
are of comparable quality of standard desktop retinal cameras, with the 
advantage of being portable and simple to use, two important features 
that make them useful in rural areas (Prime et al., 2017). 
3.4.3. Cooperation 
Another important dynamic in the FIH process is the collaborative 
aspect in its development. It is not enough to craft a new or adapted 
medical device, surgical tool, or other product innovations of adequate 
quality. Its acceptance by users is an important issue to keep in mind 
when developing such a product, whether in the case of FIH or for 
conventional innovations. In the case of FIH, product developers often 
have limited experience or medical knowledge. Therefore, they 
frequently seek to partner with healthcare facilities, such as hospitals, 
during the product’s early development stages. This is the case of an 
Indian startup which sought to develop an affordable and non-invasive 
ophthalmological diagnostic device, however the team lacked experi­
ence and expertise in ophthalmology. They then partnered with an 
ophthalmology hospital, receiving feedback from doctors on the image 
quality of their prototypes through a series of trials, allowing continuous 
improvement of the product, which was successfully launched at the end 
of the first year of development (Gupta and Thomke, 2018). Conversely, 
when ideas merge from within healthcare systems, such as the ones 
devised by physicians or other medical staff, they often seek techno­
logical or manufacture partners to put their ideas into practice (Bianchi 
et al., 2017; Gupta and Thomke, 2018; Vesci et al., 2021). Gupta and 
Thomke (2018) observed however that physicians in LMICs such as 
India are more likely to partner with a new product developer than 
physicians in HICs, since regulatory and ethical guidelines and related 
penalties are much stricter in the latter. These authors argue that the 
development of FIH in LMICs tends to be much more interactive and less 
linear, featuring prototype testing in high-fidelity test environments 
along the process. This is important due to the lack of resources, expe­
rience, and infrastructure. Exceptions to this happened recently during 
the COVID-19 pandemic, where physicians, even from HICs were much 
more involved in the development processes of FI, due to the urgency 
and severity of the situation (Corsini et al., 2020). The role of cooper­
ation in the development of frugal innovations has found rare mention in 
the literature, with some notable exceptions (Angot and Pl´
e, 2015; 
Dahan et al., 2010; Sarkar, 2021; Sarkar and Mateus, 2022; Sharmelly 
and Ray, 2018). 
Despite their superior resources, even MNCs find a need to collabo­
rate. GE, for instance, partners with medical research institutes, state 
governments, and NGOs to provide affordable and accessible healthcare 
solutions in India and Bangladesh (Sarkar, 2021). Other types of coop­
eration including more strategic ones from the business viewpoint are 
also common when developing FIH. For instance, a Dutch MNC 
deployed a small team to develop a portable device for the detection of 
an infectious disease with the help of external partners. The production 
was carried out in Southeast Asia and the distribution and examination 
was then performed by NGOs in rural and resource-constrained areas 
(Winterhalter et al., 2017). 
3.5. What: the outcomes of FIH 
Three outcome dimensions typify FIH, broadly following a variant of 
the triple bottom line approach. Where the original concept implies the 
harmonic combination of economic, social and environmental goals 
(Cohen et al., 2008; Zahra et al., 2009), what we suggest is a combi­
nation of utilitarian (economic), normative (social), and an innovation 
related outcome of FIH. Below, we describe each of these. 
3.5.1. Utilitarian - profits from the underserved customers 
Although the motivations to create frugal products for healthcare 
almost always include the desire to contribute towards the improvement 
of global health and healthcare services, striving for financial sustain­
ability and profits is an important goal for the majority of actors 
engaging in these innovation processes. Despite being able to create low- 
cost products, ventures can make good profit margins if the processes 
and business models behind the product are also low-cost (Winterhalter 
et al., 2017). Although this outcome is perceivable in the literature, 
there is not enough related information, extant information mostly 
restricted to MNCs. Although we have identified this outcome, we sug­
gest future research to focus more on this topic, both to understand the 
profit differences in companies which operate by traditional and FI 
processes but also to gain knowledge about how a company solely based 
on FIH is able to economically thrive. 
3.5.2. Normative - improvement of healthcare systems 
As technology advances, healthcare systems have the potential to 
improve their efficacy. However, products and services based on new 
technologies tend to be available only for richer countries, as higher 
prices are generally applied to compensate the costs involved in the 
research and development stages. Eventually, competition and econo­
mies of scale kick-in, pushing prices down (Allen and Christie, 2016). 
These new technologies remain unavailable for a great proportion of the 
world’s population, mostly in LMICs or the for the poorer in HICs. 
Therefore, FIH, by increasing affordability for both LMICs and HICs, can 
play an important role in increasing healthcare access worldwide. 
By providing, for instance portable diagnostic tools and treatments 
which can be used in rural areas, FIH improves healthcare systems since 
S. Sarkar and S. Mateus                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
Social Science & Medicine 306 (2022) 115127

it allows to diagnose and treat people which otherwise would have 
remained undiagnosed and untreated due to the hardships involved in 
travel to rural areas. On the other hand, this also contributes towards 
reducing the number of patients in hospitals, allowing for health pro­
fessionals to focus on the more severe cases which cannot be treated 
locally, again saving resources (Winterhalter et al., 2017). Some 
point-of-care diagnostic tools can even be used by patients themselves, 
further enhancing access (Lundin and Dumont, 2017). 
3.5.3. Reverse innovation and learning from LMICs 
A third outcome of the FIH phenomenon is the potential pivot from 
the learnings on innovation. Although a large majority of the develop­
ment and investigation of FIH is focused on LMICs as the target market, 
RI, reflecting a backward flow, can be an important consequence and 
evolution of FIH. RI refers to cases “where an innovation is adopted first 
in poor (emerging) economies before “trickling up” to rich countries” 
(Govindarajan and Ramamurti, 2011, p.191). It has been noted that 
several FIH products have the potential of, and some are indeed already, 
being used in HICs, demonstrating that these countries can learn from 
LMICs regarding the good performance of products which do not have to 
be super expensive to work safely and effectively. Examples include the 
GE ultrasound machine which was first introduced in China and proved 
to be competent to be marketed in developed countries such as the USA, 
where it is used in emergency units and ambulances (Hossain et al., 
2016; Zeschky et al., 2011). Other examples are some SMART frugal 
products by Siemens such as an X-Ray machine and a CT scanner which 
are used as in HICs, although more as backup devices (Agarwal and 
Brem, 2012). Some factors which may hinder RI include strict regulatory 
and insurance authorities, fear of monetary losses and product canni­
balism by the manufacturers, difficulties in identifying competent in­
novations, and the bias against LMICs’ innovations (Sharma and Cotton, 
2021 and references therein; Zeschky et al., 2011). If HICs begin to 
consistently apply these mindsets and processes, FIH and RI can then 
ultimately contribute not only to decrease healthcare access inequalities 
between countries, but also within a country, by decreasing the costs of 
healthcare services. 
4. Discussion 
FIH with its minimal resource use to produce efficacious healthcare 
goods or services at low costs, can be an important complementary 
reinforcement in healthcare provision. With its promise of low-cost in­
novations, frequently in collaboration with other stakeholders, FIH so­
lutions can provide affordable, and appropriate healthcare to the poorer 
citizens, whether in HICs or LMICs. While reducing spiraling healthcare 
costs in an increasingly aging society is a top priority in HICs, the 
challenge for LMICs is in providing affordable access to healthcare that 
is at the same time also appropriate for the resource-scarce settings 
(WHO, 2010). As a vast majority of the population in LMICs does not 
have access to quality healthcare (United Nations, 2020), and when 
medical equipment is available its performance is often not satisfactory, 
since LMICs contexts often lack the necessary infrastructure and re­
sources for effective use and maintenance (O’Hara, 2015), FIH solutions 
can be a fitting remedy, even as a partial response strategy. FIH provides 
appropriate solutions for LMICs, by taking into consideration the local 
constraints, for instance, erratic power supply, during the development 
process (Sarkar and Pansera, 2017). Simply providing low-cost products 
developed in HICs is often not useful or appropriate in these contexts 
(Kuo, 2017). The recent COVID-19 pandemic mobilized a diverse range 
of actors to rapidly forge solutions which could help tackle the disease 
and its spread, both in LMICs and HICs (Corsini et al., 2020; Sarkar, 
2021; Vesci et al., 2021). The urgency and stress placed on healthcare 
systems also represent an opportunity to rethink, in a context where 
current innovation processes and products in healthcare do not seem 
sustainable to provide services for everyone. FIH is worth studying as it 
has the potential to contribute to healthcare systems improvement in 
terms of affordability and, consequently, accessibility without compro­
mising on adequate performance. 
In our research we discuss the distinctive features of FIH, explicating 
higher-order constructs by subsuming the phenomenon’s complexity 
(Cornelissen, 2017), to reveal the mechanisms by which FIH unfolds. By 
synthesizing knowledge from the emerging literature on FIH, derived 
both from medical related journals, as well as management, we pivot our 
understanding on the extant frugal innovation literature. Our study ar­
ticulates a specific definition of FIH, locating this idea within the frugal 
innovation literature (e.g., Weyrauch and Herstatt, 2016; Sarkar, 2021), 
where parsimonious resource use, appropriateness, and affordability 
motivate cooperation and the creative use of existing resources. Our 
conceptualization encapsulates FIH as driven by the goals of inclusive 
and better social welfare, as well as utilitarian. 
Fig. 1 conceptualizes how different actors’ action and interaction 
lead to FIH. The resulting framework embedded within a resource 
scarcity setting, illustrates how this dynamic is motivated by the reso­
lution of both utilitarian and normative concerns. As discussed earlier, a 
diverse range of actors can be involved in FIH, ranging from local doc­
tors to MNCs, many times in cooperation to surpass resource constraints 
and develop products which contribute to the improvement of health­
care access, affordability, and quality. 
The antecedents/motivations of actors engaging in FIH play out 
along three major dimensions. The first is the identification of the ne­
cessity and willingness to contribute towards providing accessible and 
appropriate healthcare services to resource-poor segments of the pop­
ulation. A second antecedent is with respect to firms’ strategy to invest 
in resource-constrained markets, which although having low purchase 
power are of a very significant volume. As Prahalad and Hammond 
(2002), and then others (Tiwari and Herstatt, 2013) argued, there is a 
‘fortune’ to be made from addressing the needs of the world’s poorest, as 
high volumes can compensate thin margins. Therefore, the focus is on 
developing products which can be affordable for the target population 
while making sustainable margins and competing against local de­
velopers. Thirdly, a health crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic is an 
almost automatic motivator to engage in FI for any type of actor. The 
time constraints and global effects posed by the disease stimulates 
people to quickly look out for FIH solutions. 
The development of FIH comprises mainly of three strategies: opti­
mizing design function and performance according to the target market, 
optimize the use of resources and cost minimization and finally, coop­
eration between entities. As we have seen, and in line with previous 
research on FI, simply providing low-cost versions of HICs products to 
LMICs or other resource-constrained settings, is not effective since most 
of these would not be able to be used due to weaknesses in infrastruc­
ture, lack of skilled personnel, high maintenance costs, among other 
challenges. Therefore, crafting solutions that adapt existing technolo­
gies, tailored to the users’ needs and circumstances is essential. This 
implies that cost minimization along the development process must be 
achieved in order to be affordable. Since knowing the target market 
conditions is essential, cooperation with embedded and knowledgeable 
actors is often needed to fully potentiate the development and distri­
bution of FIH products. 
By putting the spotlight on the efficacy of resource-constrained in­
novations as a complementary approach to healthcare problems, we 
open both medical and management fields to a much richer discussion of 
the frugal innovation literature, one which holds that “more can be done 
with less". In this new conversation that we wish to promote in this field, 
our study implications on research, practice, as well as social, can 
further the dialogue on FI as an affordable yet efficacious healthcare 
response. We summarize next these implications. 
4.1. Research implications 
First, by providing an analysis of FIH in terms of the actors, ante­
cedents, processes, and outcomes we provide a phenomenological 
S. Sarkar and S. Mateus

overview of the topic (Fig. 1). This enables a holistic and more unified 
perspective of the phenomenon, in an incipient literature which has 
remained fragmented. We thus contribute to this literature, moving 
beyond anecdotal discussions, which do not allow the generalization of 
findings. The midrange theory that we develop in the form of a 
phenomenological framework, provides a conceptual guide for the 
development of new theoretical perspectives, and for researchers to 
undertake empirical observation and models to guide managerial 
practices. 
Second, we extend the literature of frugal innovation to include the 
healthcare sector, and its agency. FIH impacts along both utilitarian and 
normative dimensions. Our study therefore contributes and adds 
breadth to the frugal innovation literature, which has witnessed rising 
scholarly interest phenomenon. Our theoretical framing also adds depth 
to the domain, where “frugal innovation is a descriptive notion” 
(Prabhu, 2017, p.5) and has been overwhelmingly empirical, and 
anecdotal. Furthermore, our study brings together strands of medical 
and management literatures, which have often stood apart in separated 
fields of knowledge, and thus we contribute by conversing with a 
broader and relevant audience. 
Third, our study also initiates theoretical conversations around the 
role of cooperation in the development of frugal innovations, which has 
found only sporadic mention (e.g. Angot and Pl´
e, 2015; Dahan et al., 
2010; Sarkar, 2021; Sarkar and Mateus, 2022; Sharmelly and Ray, 
2018). While conventional innovations are exhorted to adopt a more 
“open” approach (Chesbrough, 2003), FIH involves important collabo­
rative aspects as a key part of its development process. 
Fourth, by exploring the FIH phenomenon we provide strongly sup­
ported suggestions of “what richer countries can learn from poorer ones” 
(Crisp, 2010). Recently, scholars have expressed concern for manage­
ment to move away from a Western-centric development that has 
dominated management and organizational studies (e.g., Bruton et al., 
2021; Muzio, 2022). The FIH phenomenon we draw attention to, as well 
as the FI on which it is embedded, illustrates such a movement. The 
phenomenological framework that we propose, can serve as a base on 
which future scholars can base their theoretical and empirical consid­
erations, not just of FIH, but other phenomena which emerge from 
resource-scarce settings. 
4.2. Practical implications 
There are also at least a couple of practical implications from our 
study. First, FIH shows how it is possible to develop ingenious, effective, 
and timely solutions to provide low-cost and appropriate healthcare 
solutions for both HICs and LMICs. FIH thus holds promise for policy 
makers around the world, so that they can consider these low costs, as 
part of RI healthcare solutions, echoing a call by the World Health Or­
ganization which has appealed for the development of innovative and 
low-cost interventions (WHO, 2020b). With governments and firms in 
developed regions being continually pushed to be innovative (Gil-Garcia 
et al., 2014), constrained fiscal situations of governments emphasize 
how frugal innovations are a way to cope with reduced public spending 
(Singh et al., 2012). Since healthcare is a major expense category for all 
countries, understanding how FIH can be integrated in healthcare sys­
tems is of special interest that can help lower healthcare costs. Our study 
can thus be a starting point to initiate conversations, especially in more 
developed countries where the use of FIH is still scant. Hopefully, 
introducing FIH products in the healthcare could in the long term also 
help reducing the out-of-pocket expenditure for citizens which is 
important since low incomes are associated with poorer health status, 
higher morbidity and mortality (Subramanian and Kawachi, 2004). 
Second, our study highlights the cooperative aspect of working across 
sectoral boundaries to achieve common goals. Successful cooperation 
implies a complementarity of parties in terms of resources and expertise. 
Cooperation gains further importance as acceptability is one major 
challenge of FIH and as healthcare system panoramas are so diverse 
across the globe. Therefore, cooperation between developers and target 
users such as medical teams may be essential to assure the adherence of 
FIH in the target markets. While cooperative actions tend to be tempo­
rary, we suggest that the development of FIH products necessarily im­
plies a strong collaborative link, as its success depends on the 
involvement of multiple actors. 
Third, by gathering successful examples of FIH and exploring the 
antecedents, processes, and outcomes. Inherent to these in a phenome­
nological form, moving away from the idea that FI implies cheap and 
low-quality products, we also intend to incentivize ventures which can 
find inspiration in this phenomenon to engage in such frugal approaches 
and RI as well. As we have seen, FIH can be achieved by both applying 
simple and low-cut technologies and more sophisticated ones, opening 
up the opportunity for diverse types of ventures to develop FIH which 
can further contribute for the improvement of healthcare systems. 
4.3. Social implications 
The outcome dimensions that characterize FIH, suggest a variant of 
the two-pronged approach of utilitarian (i.e., economic, product ori­
ented) and normative (i.e., social) aspects. As with any other venture, 
maintaining financial sustainability by pursuing profits remain an 
objective, while a social outcome is associated with the improvement of 
healthcare provision in an affordable way, to many who would other­
wise have been without such healthcare solutions. For instance, by 
developing portable and robust diagnostic and other tools which can be 
operated by non-skilled personnel and be transported to remote areas 
where these services are not available, ventures can profit from those 
underexplored markets while providing people the chance to be diag­
nosed and treated for diseases which could otherwise cause severe 
health consequences. 
The COVID-19 pandemic provides opportunity to look at healthcare 
solutions with fresh eyes, where in doing “more with less” may lie the 
answer we are searching to solve some of the inefficiency and accessi­
bility issues in healthcare. This context also provides an opportunity to 
move beyond conversations among researchers and innovation practi­
tioners, but also penetrate the broader society, breaking the stigma 
around barriers for low-cost solutions, This may extend from the 
healthcare field to other fields where high-end and expensive technol­
ogy has been considered the only option, often increasing global social 
inequalities. 
5. Limitations and future research directions 
This study has a few limitations, calling for some caution to be 
exercised in generalizing our findings. First, as in all narrative reviews 
there is some degree of subjectivity. We have tried to limit such 
subjectivity by keeping a broad scope and searching for literature and 
cases in a systematic way to avoid missing important information. A 
systematic literature review will be called for once more substantial 
literature is available. 
Second, the healthcare is unique in the intimacy, complexity, and 
sensitivity of the services it provides (Macrae and Stewart, 2019). 
Healthcare is also enormously varied, and care must be exercised when 
extending theories and understandings from management literature to 
the healthcare sector. As Vincent and Amalberti (2016) pointed out, 
healthcare is better understood as perhaps twenty different industries. 
Thus, while we propose mechanisms of the FIH phenomenon, as in all 
theoretical and conceptual developments, these are higher order un­
derstandings, and in healthcare in particular, our framework may not be 
easily and directly transfer to all healthcare settings. 
Furthermore, while we made the conscious decision to only explore 
FIH products, we realize that it is relevant to explore the remaining types 
of FIH (service, process and business model) more deeply, both through 
case studies and conceptual work. FIH models exist, for instance, the 
classical example of the Narayana Hrudayalaya Hospital in India which 
S. Sarkar and S. Mateus

provides “world-class yet cost-effective cardiac care by applying the 
principles of lean manufacturing and mass production” (Khan and 
Melkas, 2020, p.168), enabling poor people to have free or low-price 
access to quality healthcare while the hospital still attains high profit 
margins from richer patients. Understanding the organization of this and 
other examples (Cicellin et al., 2019) may be an important step for 
healthcare systems in both LMICs and HICs to be inspired in their 
mission and modus operandi aiming at increasing their services efficiency 
while expanding their reach to more underprivileged population. 
We did not explore the reasons behind the fact that HICs are more 
reluctant, although increasingly less, to adhere to FIH. Although we 
believe cultural and institutional factors may be limiting factors, it 
would be interesting to explore this venue, contrasting these and other 
realities with the ones of environments which welcome FIH, so that 
governments and other entities may be informed of the benefits and 
underlying enabling mechanisms of FIH to improve healthcare access 
and affordability. 
While these noted above limitations in turn provide opportunities for 
further research, interested scholars can further explore other fruitful 
avenues. One interesting aspect, to which we did not find enough evi­
dence, is regarding the effect of FIH in the lowering of competitor 
products’ prices. This was observed in the case of the TTK-Chitra heart 
valve, where the price of the previously imported valve which was 
standard to use was reduced by 50 per cent after the frugal valve was 
commercialized and made popular (Valiathan, 2018). In the future, it 
would be interesting to explore this effect, as it may contribute to further 
understand the outcomes of FI, both in healthcare as well as in other 
sectors. Also, regarding the more utilitarian (economic) outcome of FIH, 
there is an opportunity to explore the profitability differences between 
ventures which engage in FIH in comparison to the more traditional 
research and technological-led innovation processes. This is still an 
underdeveloped topic in FI literature which tends to focus more on the 
social outcomes of such processes. 
Moreover, we have focused primarily on FIH, and while we did 
discuss RI, it is an area of enormous interest in the healthcare sector in 
HICs, given the promise it holds of affordability as well as functionality. 
RI is a promising area to explore in the healthcare sector, for instance, 
trying to understand which are the distinctive features of frugal products 
in healthcare that make them eligible for RI. Moreover, relevant prac­
tical and policy implications can arise from understanding and pre­
dicting the effects of employing a frugal mindset and using frugal 
products in healthcare services in HICs. In summary, one can more 
deeply explore how FIH and RI can contribute to achieve United Na­
tion’s SDGs such as SDG 3: “Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being 
for all at all ages”, SDG 10: “Reduce inequality within and among 
countries” or SDG 12: “Ensure sustainable consumption and production 
patterns” (United Nations, 2020).

Economic implications of endovenous great saphenous
ablation in a public health care system
Abdalla Butt,a and David Kopriva, MDCM, FRCS(C),b,c Saskatoon and Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada
ABSTRACT
Background: In mid-2007, endovenous ablation (EVA) of the great saphenous vein was introduced into the publicly
funded health care system in Saskatchewan, Canada. We hypothesize that the introduction of EVA resulted in a decrease
in use of high ligation and stripping (HL/S), decreased costs to the health care system, and increased demand of patients
for great saphenous vein ablative procedures.
Methods: We retrospectively reviewed administrative data to capture cases of HL/S between 2003 and 2014 and cases of
EVA of the great saphenous vein (endovenous laser treatment and radiofrequency ablation) between 2007 and 2014.
Accounting for the change in practice pattern that occurred slowly between 2007 and 2009, we divided our patients into
the pre-EVA era (2003-2006) and the post-EVA era (2010-2014). Procedure costs were determined with models used by
our health region for this purpose.
Results: Utilization rates for great saphenous vein intervention remained similar in the pre-EVA (90 procedures per year)
and post-EVA (92 procedures per year; P ¼ .83) eras. Case costs of HL/S ($1965.12/case) were higher than those of
EVA (endovenous laser treatment, $1295.08/case; radiofrequency ablation, $1410.54/case). The total annual costs of great
saphenous vein intervention decreased from $176,861 in the pre-EVA era to $134,525 (P ¼ .02).
Conclusions: Introduction of publicly funded EVA has reduced rates of HL/S and reduced costs to our health system by
approximately $42,000 per year, without increasing great saphenous vein intervention rates. (J Vasc Surg: Venous and

Symptomatic
varicose
veins
associated
with
great
saphenous venous incompetence are typically treated
with great saphenous vein ablation to prevent reﬂux
from the common femoral vein into the superﬁcial
venous system. High ligation and stripping (HL/S) of the
great saphenous vein is an effective treatment of lower
extremity varices associated with this anatomy, but less
invasive methods of eliminating great saphenous vein
reﬂux, using endovenous laser (EVL) or radiofrequency
ablation (RFA), also demonstrate good outcomes and
may be preferable to patients compared with the open
surgical option.1
Both EVL and RFA procedures require costly equip-
ment and disposables. A previously published random-
ized,
controlled
trial
comparing
HL/S
of
the
great
saphenous vein with EVL demonstrated higher proce-
dural costs with EVL.2 When indirect costs of lost
productivity of the patient were included, the total cost
associated with EVL remained higher than for HL/S.
Within this study, however, both HL/S and EVL were
performed as outpatient ofﬁce-based procedures under
tumescent anesthesia. In many institutions, including
ours, HL/S is performed as a day-surgery procedure under
general or regional anesthesia.
A second randomized, controlled trial comparing RFA
with HL/S demonstrated that RFA had higher procedural
costs but lower total cost because of reduced convales-
cent time and productivity loss with the RFA procedure.3
In this study, both RFA and HL/S were performed in oper-
ating rooms under general anesthesia, but our center,
like many others, offers RFA and EVL under tumescent
anesthesia as an ambulatory care procedure. Therefore,
the cost differential to the health care system associated
with switching from HL/S as a day-surgery procedure to
EVL or RFA as an ambulatory care procedure remains
to be documented.
Before 2007, patients in our practice who required
elimination of great saphenous vein reﬂux underwent
HL/S in an operating room under general or spinal anes-
thesia. In 2007, we initiated a program of publicly funded
EVL as a hospital-based, ambulatory care procedure with
the expectation that the demand for HL/S procedures
would decrease, freeing time in operating rooms and
achieving cost savings. In 2014, our program switched
from EVL to RFA as the ambulatory care procedure of
choice.
We hypothesize that the introduction of endovenous
ablation (EVL or RFA) in a publicly funded health care sys-
tem is associated with decreased use of HL/S and results in
cost savings. Because of the patients’ preference for EVL
and RFA over HL/S, we further hypothesize that the intro-
duction of publicly funded EVL and RFA is associated with
an increased demand of patients for great saphenous vein
ablation as a treatment of varicose veins. Increased service
utilization could outweigh any cost savings.
METHODS
Within the Canadian health care system, necessary med-
ical procedures are insured by provincial government
health plans. Within our jurisdiction, as with most loca-
tions in Canada, treatment of symptomatic (but not
cosmetic) varicose veins is an insured service to which res-
idents are entitled. Two hospitals in our city serve a popu-
lation of approximately 230,000 people and provide
tertiary referral services for a wider population of approxi-
mately 450,000. The population of our health region has
remained stable through the study period.
The discharge abstract database is an electronic data
set that captures International Classiﬁcation of Dis-
eases-coded diagnostic and procedural information for
all inpatients and day-surgery patients in our health
region. The data are submitted to the Canadian Institute
for Health Information for administrative and research
purposes. The health region is accountable for the qual-
ity of data submitted from our hospitals.4
We undertook a retrospective review of patients who
underwent treatment of great saphenous reﬂux with
HL/S,
EVL,
or
RFA
between
January
1,
2003,
and
December 31, 2014, at our center. All patients undergoing
HL/S during the study period were identiﬁed through a
computerized search of the hospital discharge abstract
database, and all cases with procedure codes for HL/S
performed at both hospitals in our city were included.
Patients undergoing small saphenous vein interventions
were excluded from this study. All patients who under-
went EVL or RFA during the study period were identiﬁed
in a database of cases maintained by the single ambula-
tory care department of the hospital in which all these
cases were performed. Indications for intervention were
the same for HL/S, EVL, and RFA. All patients had great
saphenous vein incompetence causing symptoms or
skin changes, including ulceration, caused by superﬁcial
venous hypertension (C2S-6S).5 Our data captured all pa-
tients who underwent great saphenous vein intervention
in our health region during the study period. Identiﬁable
patient data were not available in the discharge abstract
database or in the ambulatory care database.
ARTICLE HIGHLIGHTS
d Type of Research: Retrospective cohort study
d Take Home Message: Publicly funded endovenous
saphenous vein ablations in Saskatchewan, Canada,
were associated with no increase in saphenous abla-
tions and a 23.9% cost savings by decreasing utiliza-
tion of operating room and day-surgery resources for
high ligation and stripping.
d Recommendation: The authors suggest that in the
Canadian health system, it is cost effective to fund
endovenous saphenous ablation procedures.

Private vein clinics in our geographic area do not
provide any great saphenous vein interventions. Private
clinics provide sclerotherapy for cosmetic varicose veins
and transcutaneous laser treatment of telangiectasias.
The nearest city with a private vein clinic providing great
saphenous vein interventions is located 394 km from our
center, across the international border, within the United
States. The nearest Canadian cities with private vein
clinics that provide great saphenous vein interventions
are at a distance of 783 km, 760 km, and 571 km, respec-
tively. Most of our patients who require great saphenous
vein intervention are currently able to receive a treat-
ment date, within our local public health care system,
that is within 1 to 2 weeks after presentation with symp-
tomatic great saphenous vein incompetence. Therefore,
there is little waitlist-related incentive to travel for private
treatments. Because of these factors, we believe the
number of patients traveling out of our region to receive
privately funded EVL or RFA is low.
Patients who underwent HL/S during the study period
were offered a day-surgery procedure. This consisted of
admission to a day-surgery unit; the surgical procedure
was then performed in an operating room, with general
or regional anesthesia performed by an anesthetist. The
patient was admitted postoperatively to a postanesthesia
care unit for a period of observation (typically about
1 hour), then discharged later in the day from the day-
surgery unit. All patients who underwent HL/S had phlebec-
tomies of calf or thigh varices performed as part of the index
procedure, and the associated costs were included.
In contrast, patients who underwent EVL or RFA pre-
sented to the ambulatory care area of our hospital and
underwent the procedure in the ambulatory surgery
center of the hospital, under tumescent anesthesia
administered by the surgeon. All patients undergoing
EVL or RFA had foam sclerotherapy of calf varices at
the initial procedure, and the cost was included. There
were no phlebectomies performed on patients undergo-
ing EVL or RFA. Patients were discharged immediately
after the procedure.
Within our system, which represents a form of capita-
tion, geographic health regions are allocated a global
budget for hospital-based treatments. Provision of ser-
vices does not generate additional revenue, but each
therapeutic service represents a cost center. Within this
context, the physician’s remuneration is based on a fee
for service. Estimates of costs to the health care system
were provided by our institution’s ﬁnancial department
and included direct periprocedural and procedural costs.
Elements in the cost model included the direct cost of
staff, which was estimated on the basis of the time
required for each task in the patient’s care process and
the hourly remuneration rate for each staff role involved.
The estimated direct stafﬁng costs included a 20% pre-
mium for nonproductive time, including paid staff leave.
Paid employment beneﬁts, such as pensions and dental
and health coverage, were also included in the direct
stafﬁng costs.
Included in the cost estimates for HL/S were stafﬁng
costs for admitting and registering the patient, health
records and administrative staff, hospital porter, day
surgery, postanesthesia recovery, and operating room
nursing staff. Preprocedure supplies related to the pa-
tient’s admission and medical charting were included.
Procedural costs included disposable surgical and anes-
thetic supplies. Durable goods, such as surgical instru-
ments and anesthetic equipment, were amortized over
the appropriate time interval. A complete list of the com-
ponents included in the costing model is appended
(Supplementary Tables I-IV, online only). Indirect costs
for each procedure were estimated by our health re-
gion’s ﬁnancial department at 18.08% of the direct pro-
cedural
costs.
The
indirect
costs
included
the
proportion of the global cost for hospital heating, light-
ing, maintenance, management, and other supportive
but necessary functions that were attributed to the
provision of HL/S.
Costs of great saphenous ablation with EVL were calcu-
lated in the same manner. The costs associated with
registration of the patient were the same as for HL/S,
but the stafﬁng costs for nursing in day surgery and
postanesthesia recovery were omitted as the patients
did not use these services. Similarly, there was no need
for portering staff. Operating room nursing costs were
replaced with ambulatory care nursing costs. All stafﬁng
costs included the same 20% premium for beneﬁts and
nonproductive time as in the HL/S model. Direct costs of
supplies were represented by the actual cost of dispos-
ables used for each procedure (eg, microintroducer set,
laser sheath, laser ﬁber, guidewire). We included process-
ing costs of reusable instruments. The laser generator for
EVL cases was purchased by the hospital and was used
for its full lifetime and discarded after it was no longer
functional. The laser generator served for 533 EVL cases,
and the cost of the generator was amortized over
this number of uses. EVL cases were performed under
tumescent anesthesia administered by the surgeon.
The costs of the local anesthetic and supplies were
accounted for and negated the cost of the anesthetist
and anesthetic supplies required for HL/S cases.
In 2014, the laser generator used for EVL cases ceased to
function, and our program switched to RFA for endove-
nous ablation of the great saphenous vein. Our RFA sup-
plier provided the radiofrequency energy generator free
of charge to the hospital, incorporating the cost of the
generator into the price of the disposable radiofrequency
catheters purchased for these cases. This enabled us to
simply calculate the actual case costs for RFA cases
without the need to estimate the amortization period
of the radiofrequency generator. All other costs for RFA,
including stafﬁng and disposable and reusable materials,
were identical to the model used for EVL. Indirect costs

were calculated by our hospital’s ﬁnancial department at
18.08% of the direct costs for EVL and RFA, as for HL/S.
All costs are reported in Canadian dollars and are not
adjusted for inﬂation. The surgeon’s and anesthetist’s
fees were calculated from the Saskatchewan Payment
Schedule for Insured Services Provided by a Physician.6
This study was approved by the Regina Qu’Appelle Health
Region Research Ethics Board, and the requirement for
consent of individual patients was waived. Case volumes
and costs were compared with Student t-test.
RESULTS
The annual case numbers for great saphenous vein
intervention are shown in Fig 1, accounting for all cases
performed within our health region. EVL was introduced
in 2007 and was associated with a decline in the number
of HL/S operations. However, contrary to our hypothesis,
the total number of great saphenous interventions did
not increase with the introduction of EVL and RFA.
Between 2003 and 2006, a mean of 90 HL/S operations
were performed in our health region per year. Account-
ing for a transition in practice patterns between 2007
and 2009, HL/S operations decreased to a mean of 20.4
operations per year between 2010 and 2014 (P < .0001).
Accounting for a mean of 71.6 EVL and RFA procedures
per year in 2010 to 2014, the total number of saphenous
vein interventions remained similar in the two time pe-
riods (a mean of 90 great saphenous interventions per
year were performed in our health region in 2003-2006
and a mean of 92 per year in 2010-2014; P ¼ .83).
The calculated case costs for HL/S under general and
spinal anesthesia are shown in the Table. The costs are
similar between the two different anesthetic techniques;
the calculated case cost of HL/S is higher than that of EVL
or RFA. RFA was slightly costlier than EVL. A detailed cost
breakdown is included in Supplementary Tables I to IV
(online only).
The procedure costs, excluding the physician’s fees and
stafﬁng costs, were higher for EVL ($749.54 per case) and
RFA ($865.00 per case) than for HL/S ($507.12) because of
the expensive, single-use items, such as laser ﬁbers,
sheaths, and radiofrequency catheters, as well as the
amortized cost of reusable items, including the laser en-
ergy generator and radiofrequency generator. However,
the introduction of EVL and RFA permitted cases to be
moved into an ambulatory care setting, which saved
$602.57 per case in stafﬁng costs by avoiding the use of
the day-surgery unit and postanesthesia care unit. In
addition, a cost savings of $350.40 was achieved in the
physician’s fees for anesthesia care.
The annual costs to the public health system for great
saphenous
vein
intervention
in
our
health
region
decreased from a mean of $176,861 between 2003 and
2006 to $134,525 between 2010 and 2014 (P ¼ .02).
Fig 2 depicts the year over year costs for great saphenous
vein intervention in our health region. The mean annual
cost savings associated with the introduction of EVL
and RFA into our hospital was $42,336.

saphenous vein ablation (EVL or RFA) as an insured
health beneﬁt. The cost of HL/S is typically covered,
but even so, provincial health programs are careful to
discourage overuse of HL/S. In the province of Ontario,
stipulated conditions must be met by patients and
providers for public funding of HL/S. These include docu-
mentation of saphenofemoral reﬂux with Doppler or
duplex ultrasound scanning, failure of 3 months of con-
servative therapy consisting of prescribed compression
stockings and analgesics, and presence of complications
or unremitting symptoms from the varicose veins.7
In the context of publicly funded HL/S, public institutions
may be disincentivized from provision of EVL or RFA by the
costs associated with the procedure, including the pur-
chase of lasers or radiofrequency generators, not to
mention the cost of disposable materials, such as sheaths,
laser ﬁbers, and radiofrequency catheters. Furthermore,
funders might have concerns about an unwarranted in-
crease in the use of vein ablation procedures when mini-
mally invasive options are made available.
In many large Canadian cities, EVL and RFA are
performed in private vein clinics, and the costs of these
procedures are charged directly to patients. However,
the economic viability of these clinics depends on a pop-
ulation base of adequate size to ensure that case
numbers generate sufﬁcient revenue. The establishment
of private clinics to provide endovenous saphenous vein
ablation in small population centers, such as ours, is
less favorable because of potentially lower proﬁt margins
and greater uncertainty of adequate case volumes.
In our health region, the main driver for the introduc-
tion of EVL and RFA was a need to reduce wait times
for
patients
undergoing
surgery.
To
contribute
to
improved access to the operating room, EVL and RFA
were introduced to move most cases of HL/S out of the
operating room and into an ambulatory care setting for
which the waitlist was much shorter. This was intended
to free resources in the operating room that could be
deployed for other surgical cases. We now demonstrate
the cost-effectiveness of this approach.
This study shows that publicly funded EVL and RFA pro-
cedures are cost-effective in a population center, such as
ours, of inadequate size to support private provision of
these services. Contrary to our initial hypothesis, we did
not observe an increase in the use of great saphenous
vein ablation after the introduction of EVL and RFA into
the publicly funded health system. Furthermore, the
cost savings associated with moving most great saphe-
nous vein procedures from a day-surgery and operating
room setting to an ambulatory care setting more than
compensated for the expenses incurred. The availability
of ambulatory EVL and RFA resulted in a net saving of
>$42,000 per year.
A major criticism of our study would be that in a publicly
funded system, the savings that we estimate cannot be
actualized. Even though great saphenous HL/S cases can
most often be taken out of the operating room, the oper-
ating room will continue to function and the staff will
continue to work, performing other surgical cases. The na-
ture of the operating room case mix would have changed,
but no savings would have been achieved. We concede
this to be the case. However, our estimate of the annual
cost savings can be considered equivalent to a realloca-
tion of $42,000 of resources that have now been made
available to enable other surgical patients to access day
surgery and the operating room. In effect, the cost savings
may be considered to have been reinvested into reduc-
tion of the surgical waitlist.
The cost savings that we document in this study are not
particular to the use of EVL or RFA but rather represent

ambulatory care setting. The use of EVL and RFA made
this change in treatment paradigm highly acceptable
to patients and care providers. However, a similar or
even greater cost savings might be achievable through
the use of other techniques, like ultrasound-guided
foam sclerotherapy.8
CONCLUSIONS
The introduction of publicly funded endovenous abla-
tion of the great saphenous vein (EVL and RFA) in our
health region was associated with a reduction in HL/S.
The change was not associated with any increase in the
overall use of great saphenous vein interventions. The
introduction of EVL and RFA to our health region resulted
in an estimated cost saving of >$42,000 per year.
The authors would like to acknowledge the valuable
contribution of Dr Donald J. McCarville in providing
review and feedback on this work.

Objectives: The scaling up of antiretroviral treatment (ART) for HIV-infected adults requires
a sizeable investment of resources in the South African public health care system. It is
important that these resources are used productively and in ways that reach those in need,
irrespective of social status or personal characteristics. In this study we evaluate whether
the distribution of ART services in the public system reﬂects the distribution of need among
adults in the urban population.
Methods: Data from a 2008 national survey were used to estimate the distribution of socioe-
conomic status (SES) and sex in HIV-positive adults in urban areas. These ﬁndings were
compared to SES and sex distributions in 635 ART users within 6 urban public ART facilities.
Results: Close to 40% of those with HIV are in the lowest SES quintile, while 67% are women.
The distributions in users of ART are similar to these distributions in HIV-positive people.
Conclusions: Patterns of ART use in study settings correspond to patterns of HIV in the urban
population at the national level. This suggests that the South African ART programme is on
track to ensure equitable delivery of treatment services in urban settings.

1. Introduction
Sub-Saharan Africa has only 10% of the world’s pop-
ulation, but has more than two-thirds of the world’s
HIV-infected people and bore more than three-quarters
of the HIV-related deaths in 2007. Southern Africa is the
most affected region with more than 35% of the world’s
HIV-infected people, half of whom live in South Africa
[1]. Extensive circular migration between other Southern

(S. Cleary).
African countries and South Africa is also likely to con-
tribute to these epidemics [2].
In the recent “HIV&AIDS and STI National Strategic Plan”
[3] the South African government committed to providing
“an appropriate package of treatment, care and support ser-
vices to 80% of people living with HIV. . . by 2011” (p. 64).
The 2004 National Antiretroviral Treatment Guidelines [4]
recommend that antiretroviral treatment (ART) for adults
should be started when an individual’s CD4 count falls
below 200 cells/l and/or the individual has an AIDS diag-
nosis, hence providing an evidence-based measure of ART
need. Allocating resources according to need, irrespective
of sex, socio-economic status (SES) or any other character-
istic of individuals would represent the most productive
use of these resources. Such an approach would also be con-

sistent with stated equity goals within the strategic plan
about “tackling inequality and poverty” and “promoting
equality for women and girls” (p. 60).
A recent review of the ART equity literature [5] identi-
ﬁed only one study from developing countries that assessed
equitable use of ART [6], which found evidence of socioe-
conomic inequalities in the use of ART. An implication of
these ﬁndings is that the scaling up of ART could be associ-
ated with increased inequities in health, if the relatively
wealthy of those in need are able to access the service
more readily than their worse off counterparts. The study
was however conducted during the early years of the ART
scale up in a particular rural setting in South Africa and the
ﬁndings may not be generalizable to more recent time peri-
ods or to other settings. Because of the paucity of available
evidence, the review [5] argues that monitoring socioeco-
nomic inequalities in the use of ART is a key area for future
research.
While it is common in health services research to
analyse socioeconomic inequalities in health service use
[7], there is much debate about how SES is deﬁned and
measured. Some argue that SES is best measured by house-
hold income, consumption or expenditure, but these data
are often difﬁcult to collect and are seldom available in
developing countries [8]. In addition, measures of income
and consumption may not capture seasonal variations
in income and expenditure patterns, may suffer from
reporting and recall bias and are not sensitive to non-
cash transfers and income in kind [9]. As an alternative,
researchers are increasingly using household and individ-
ual characteristics as measures of SES including ownership
of assets, access to services (e.g. water and sanitation), level
of education and employment status [9].
In this study we describe the SES and sex of HIV-positive
adults (18 years or older) in urban South Africa based on
an analysis of a national survey and compare these dis-
tributions to those in the adult users of ART within the
public health care system using a sample of ART patients
drawn from two urban communities. If the distributions of
users differ from the distributions of HIV-positive adults,
this could indicate inequalities in use among the subpopu-
lation with needs and hence potential inequities in access
to care within the urban population.
2. Methods
2.1. Distribution of SES and sex in HIV-positive people in
the national survey
In South Africa, no routine data are available regard-
ing the characteristics of individuals with HIV and/or in
need of ART within local communities. Corresponding
data do however exist at the national level. In 2008 the
Human Sciences Research Council (HSRC) completed their
third cross-sectional household survey of HIV seropreva-
lence [10]. Details regarding the survey methodology are
available in published sources [11]. Brieﬂy, a multi-stage
stratiﬁed sampling approach was applied, with sampling
frames based on enumerator areas used in the most recent
national census, with updates to reﬂect changes in the
socio-demographic proﬁle of the country since this time.
One thousand enumerator areas formed the primary sam-
pling unit, with households as the secondary unit. Eligible
individuals selected within households were the ﬁnal sam-
pling unit.
Data from this survey include individual HIV-status,
sex and race as well as a range of household and individ-
ual characteristics (main source of drinking water; main
source of energy for cooking; type of toilet facility; own-
ership of fridge, radio, TV, land line telephone and cellular
telephone; formal or informal urban settlement; age and
sex of the household head, individual’s education level and
employment status). We used these household and indi-
vidual characteristics to estimate an SES measure for adult
respondents living in urban areas. This measure is then
applied to the subset of adult respondents with an HIV-
positive diagnosis in order to generate the distribution of
HIV positive individuals by SES. Subjects were excluded if
responses to any of these variables were missing. While
other researchers have chosen to replace missing SES vari-
ables with the mean value for that variable, this approach
may reduce variation amongst households and create prob-
lems with clumping or truncation [9]. Clumping occurs
when it is difﬁcult to differentiate between households
given the variables being used, for example if households
have similar levels of access to services and ownership of
assets they will tend to share the same SES rank or group.
Truncation implies a more even distribution of SES, but
spread over a narrow band making it difﬁcult to distinguish
between SES groupings [9].
The SES measure was constructed using Multiple Corre-
spondence Analysis (MCA) of the selected household and
individual characteristics. While the construction of SES
indices is commonly achieved using Principal Components
Analysis (PCA) [12], such a technique is more appropri-
ate for use with continuous, normally distributed data as
opposed to the predominantly categorical data often used
in SES indices development [13]. Correspondence Analy-
sis (CA) is a type of PCA where rows and columns of the
data matrix are plotted as points in the Euclidean space
and the method seeks to redeﬁne the dimensions of space
for the purposes of data reduction [14]. MCA is an extension
of CA suitable for analysing two or more categorical vari-
ables. The ﬁrst principal axis is normally taken to represent
the subject’s SES because this by deﬁnition captures the
highest proportion of inertia (variance) in the characteris-
tics used to create the index [9,12–14]. The reliability and
internal consistency of the resulting index was assessed
using Cronbach’s alpha. It is generally accepted that
alpha values greater than 0.7 are regarded as satisfactory
[15].
The analysis was conducted in SPSS 17 after weight-
ing the sample to adjust for any over or under sampling
in terms of race, locality type (e.g. urban formal/informal
settlements), province, sex and age group, as described in
Shisana et al. [10]. This procedure generates a ﬁnal sample
representative of the population of South Africa.
2.2. Distribution of SES and sex in the users of ART
After discussions with provincial ministries of health,
two health sub-districts were purposively chosen as study
S. Cleary et al. / Health Policy 99 (2011) 261–266
263
sites. Mitchells Plain is a poor urban community in Cape
Town in the Western Cape province with a population
of approximately 500,000 individuals of whom 17% were
living in informal housing in 2001 [16]. Region D is pre-
dominantly comprised of the Soweto township in the City
of Johannesburg, Gauteng province. This area had a popula-
tion of approximately 1.1 million of whom 16% were living
in informal housing in 2001 [16].
A sampling procedure was established to allow for the
creation of a representative sample of users of public sector
ART services in these subdistricts. The planned sample of
users in each site was calculated using a Chi-squared “good-
ness of ﬁt” test (alpha = 0.05; power = 0.8) [17]. Although no
data were available on either the SES of those with HIV or
the SES of those using ART services at the sub district level,
we hypothesized that those using ART would have a higher
SES than those in need, but conservatively assumed that
the average difference in SES would be small (4%). From
this we estimated a required sample size of 125 for each
site. The ﬁnal planned sample size was then increased to
300 to allow for within-site analysis.
Because the most efﬁcient way of sampling users is
to conduct surveys at the point of use in health facili-
ties, we ﬁrst identiﬁed a representative sample of health
care facilities. In Mitchells Plain, three public facilities pro-
vide ART services. All three facilities were included, and
within these facilities, users were sampled proportional to
the number of ART patients enrolled in the facilities. In
Soweto, ART services are conﬁgured such that one facil-
ity has a very large population of patients on ART while
six other facilities are far smaller. A stratiﬁed random sam-
pling procedure was conducted with the large facility in
one stratum and the smaller facilities in the other. We then
selected the large facility and randomly selected two of
the six smaller facilities, with sample sizes of users within
each facility set proportional to the contribution to the
total patient load in those facilities. Within each facility,
patients were randomly selected for interviews. However,
because interviews were conducted in parallel within facil-
ities, the eventual sample sizes were slightly different from
what had been planned. The proportion of interviewees
that were female was also higher than would be expected
given the sex distributions of facility users. We adjusted for
this using frequency weights during analysis.
In both communities, subjects were included if they had
been taking ART for at least 14 days, were over the age of
18 and were judged by clinical staff to be sufﬁciently well
to be interviewed. The interview was conducted by trained
ﬁeldworkers using an exit interview questionnaire in the
language of each subject’s choice.
Completed questionnaires were checked for accuracy
by a data collection coordinator and double entered into a
data entry platform speciﬁcally designed for this purpose in
EpiData version 3 [18]. Data were then exported to Stata/SE
10.0 and SPSS 17 for analysis. Written informed consent to
participate in the study was obtained from each subject.
Ethical approval for the study was granted by committees
at the University of Cape Town and the University of the
Witwatersrand.
2.3. Comparing the SES distributions of users in the study
sites and those with HIV in the national survey
To enable a comparison of the SES distribution of users
at the sub district level with the SES distribution of HIV+
individuals in the national survey, the dimension 1 coor-
dinates estimated within the MCA in the national survey
were applied to the same variables contained within the
user dataset. The same quintile cutoff values from the
national survey were used for the users; the resulting dis-
tribution of SES in users can then be compared directly to
the SES of the overall urban population in the national sur-
vey as well as the HIV-positive subset of this population.
The “Partitions of Pearson’s Chi-square test” for contin-
gency table analysis of ordered categorical variables (e.g.
quintiles) was used to test for differences and trends in SES
for HIV-positive individuals and those using ART for all, and
for sex subgroups. This test is used to determine the extent
to which the distribution of SES across these quintiles dif-
fers in two ways: in terms of location (central tendency)
across quintiles and dispersion (variation) across quintiles.
3. Results
The national survey conducted HIV-testing in 7013
adults living in urban areas, of whom 813 were HIV-
positive. After excluding those with missing SES variables,
the ﬁnal sample included 6430 adults (742 HIV-positive).
As shown in Table 1, over two-thirds of the HIV-positive
adults were women (67.4%; 95% CI: 61.5–72.9) and 97.5%
(95% CI: 96.4–98.3) were African. In the user sites, 655
adults were interviewed (331 in Soweto and 323 in
Mitchells Plain) and 635 (319 in Soweto and 316 in
Mitchells Plain) provided complete SES data. Similar dis-
tributions were found in the user group in terms of sex
and race, with 65.7% of the sample being female (95%

Fig. 1. Quintiles of adult urban population SES in total, and by sex.
Data are from the “South African national HIV prevalence, incidence,
behaviour and communication survey 2008” [8].
CI: 60.6–70.7) and 95.6% (95% CI: 94.0–97.3) African (see
Table 1). Because of the very small number of non-Africans
in the user and HIV-positive samples, equity questions
related to race could not be addressed in this paper.
Results from the MCA indicated that the proportion of
total inertia (variance) explained by the ﬁrst axis of the SES
index was 0.31 indicating that the relative frequency val-
ues that can be reconstructed from a single dimension can
reproduce 31% of the total Chi-square value for the under-
lying contingency table. The Cronbach’s alpha score of 0.82
exceeded the 0.7 level generally considered to indicate rea-
sonable reliability and internal consistency [15].
Fig. 1 presents the quintile distribution of SES among
the adult urban population (and population sex subgroups)
developed in the MCA. As shown in this ﬁgure, the index
produced 5 equal sized groupings in this adult urban pop-
ulation, indicating no problems with clumping. When we
examined the SES distributions by sex, we see fairly even
distributions across quintiles for both men and women,
although women are marginally under-represented in
wealthier quintiles and over-represented in the poorer
quintiles.
Fig. 2 presents the SES distribution in HIV-positive
adults living in urban areas from the national survey and
compares this with the SES distribution in the users of
ART services in Mitchells Plain and Soweto. Close to 40% of
the HIV-positive population were in the lowest SES quin-
tile and a further 27% in the second lowest SES quintile.
HIV-positive women were more likely to fall in poorer SES
groups than men, with 68% of women with HIV/AIDS being
in the poorest two SES groups compared to only 56% of men.
The proportion of users in the poorest SES group in total
and for men and women was similar to the proportions
of HIV-positive people in these groups. The proportion of
users in the second poorest quintile exceeded the propor-
tion of those with HIV/AIDS in this SES group. However, use
was proportionally lower in the higher SES groups, with a
notable absence of users in the highest quintile.
As shown in Table 2 there were no signiﬁcant dif-
ferences in the distribution by SES between HIV-positive
adults and the users of ART. We also explored grouping the
distributions into the three poorest quintiles and two rich-
est quintiles as well as the two poorest quintiles and three
richest quintiles, but as before no signiﬁcant differences
were detected (P-value = 0.26).
4. Discussion
In urban South Africa, the distribution of HIV is skewed
towards women (67%) and the lowest SES quintile (38%).
Because 98% of the HIV-positive respondents and 96% of
the users of ART were African, it was not possible to explore
equity questions in relation to race or to control for race as a
confounder of socio-economics status in the HIV-positive
population. As far as we are aware, this is the ﬁrst time
that the SES of those with HIV in urban South Africa has
been described. In contrast, a rural study found that house-

Data on the SES distribution in HIV-positive adults are from the “South African national HIV prevalence, incidence, behaviour and communication survey
2008” [8] while data on the SES distribution in ART users are from surveys in Mitchells Plain and Soweto.

holds in the middle category of relative SES were at a higher
risk of HIV-infection [19]. In another study in rural South
Africa, no relationship was found between household SES
and seroconversion [20]. However, both of these studies
were conducted in relatively homogenous, poor rural areas
and the results are not directly comparable to urban areas.
The distribution of HIV by sex suggests a female to male
infection ratio of 2.0, which is higher than the ratio of 1.7
reported for all age groups and areas [10] as well as the
overall estimate of 1.7 reported by UNAIDS for sub-Saharan
Africa [21]. A possible explanation for this difference is that
HIV-positive women in urban areas are more likely than
men to have used services in the past, possibly because
their entry to ART is facilitated through their use of repro-
ductive and antenatal care services, including prevention
of mother to child transmission of HIV services [22]. If this
is the case, there could be an impact on relative survival by
sex and the distribution of HIV by sex.
When the sex and SES distributions of HIV computed
from the national survey are compared to the users of
ART services in two urban communities, no statistically
signiﬁcant evidence of inequalities (differences in sex and
SES distributions between users and those with HIV/AIDS)
is found (all P-values > 0.05). A recent review of the ART
equity literature [5] found only one study from develop-
ing countries on socioeconomic inequalities in ART use
[6] which was conducted in a rural part of South Africa
during the early years of the public sector scaling up of
ART (2003–2005). The study found signiﬁcant evidence of
socioeconomic inequities in the uptake of these services,
thereby supporting the “inverse equity hypothesis” [6, p.
61] which suggests that the scaling up of new interven-
tions may initially lead to a reduction in equity as higher
SES groups within the population in need tend to comprise
the greatest proportion of users. However, as programmes
expand, barriers to access are reduced or removed and
those least able to overcome those initial barriers to access
are now able to use services. Our study found no evidence
of such inequity by 2008 at which time ART had been avail-
able in the study communities for approximately 5 years. In
addition, the previous study was performed in a rural set-
ting where levels of access to services are generally poorer
than in urban areas. Social inequity in these populations
might be explained by the lower levels of availability in
these areas and the advantageous position of better off
groups in overcoming such challenges. This implies that
our results found in urban areas may not be generalizable
to other parts of the country.
This research has two main limitations. First, because
data are not available on HIV-status by SES for the study
population, we used a national survey to estimate the
SES distribution of those with HIV. While these data are
representative of the urban populations as a whole, they
are not necessarily representative of the study popula-
tion. Secondly, similar to Tsai et al. [6] we have assessed
socio-economic inequalities in use by comparing users to
HIV-positive individuals. In principle the analysis should
be performed by comparing users to those in need, follow-
ing current ART guidelines which suggest initiation within
deﬁned CD4 strata. These clinical guidelines provide an
evidence-based measure of ART need. However, no data
sources currently exist in South Africa that includes HIV-
status, CD4 count and a measure of SES.
Using the SES of those with HIV as a proxy for the SES
of those in need is not without problems. In particular SES
might change through loss of income or through increased
health care costs when the HIV-positive person becomes
sick, which would normally happen during the later stages
of HIV-infection. Available evidence on the change in SES
over the course of HIV-infection is however mixed. While
there is some evidence of this change in SES from long term
ethnographic studies, researchers have also expressed sur-
prise at the overall resilience of households despite their
hardships [23,24]. There has also been limited evidence of
these economic impacts in quantitative analyses [24,25].
Despite these shortcomings, these results have impor-
tant policy implications. We were unable to ﬁnd evidence
of signiﬁcant inequities in urban ART use by sex or socio-
economic status. Given the large investment of public
resources into HIV-treatment services, it is noteworthy that
this service appears to have been distributed in ways that
reﬂect both an efﬁcient use of resources and the equity
goals of the government. South Africa will face many chal-
lenges in successfully scaling up ART services in the next
decade. We hope that our ﬁnding that this service has the
potential to be equitable will add impetus to commitments
to reaching and sustaining full coverage of ART for all in
need.

Evaluation of the effect of store-
and-forward teledermatology on
in-person health care system
utilization in a safety-net public
health and hospital system
To the Editor: Store-and-forward (SAF) telederma-
tology has demonstrated cost effectiveness in
several studies, particularly by reducing in-person
dermatology visits and travel costs for patients.1-4
However, few studies have evaluated its effects on
health care system utilization over a specific period.
We sought to evaluate the effect of teledermatology
on dermatology referralerelated in-person health
care facility utilization at Parkland Health and
Hospital
System
(PHHS),
a
Dallas
safety-net
hospital system.
This is a retrospective study comparing 3 cohorts
of patients referred by PHHS primary care providers
for dermatology evaluation from October 1, 2015
through
September
30,
2016.
The
3
cohorts
consisted of (1) patients evaluated through SAF
teledermatology
from
4
primary
care
clinics
(PCCs), (2) patients from PCCs without access to
teledermatology referred for in-person visits, and
(3) patients from the 4 PCCs with access to
teledermatology but referred for in-person visits.
We compared the demographic, diagnostic, and
clinical management data of the 3 cohorts (Table I).
We used a random number sequence generator to
select a randomized sample of 285 patients for each
cohort. We defined utilization as an in-person visit in
which the patient received treatment for the referred
dermatologic condition. We recorded the number of
outpatient or emergency department visits within
PHHS over a 12-month period that were related to
the referred dermatologic condition. Our primary
outcome was the percentage of patients with at least
1 visit in each of two 6-month intervals. To compare
group utilization, SAS 9.4 was used to model the
binary categorical repeated measures including the
defined groups, time, and interaction of group by
time. If the interaction was nonsignificant, the model
was rerun to examine the effect of removing the
interaction on results for the main effects (group or
time).
We found that there was signiﬁcantly decreased

health
care
facility
utilization

patients
with

conditions
receiving

compared with those patients receiving in-person
referrals from clinics without access to teledermatol-
ogy (Fig 1, and Mendeley supplemental Fig 1, A and
B, available at https://doi.org/10.17632/v57xjb9g99.
1). There was no significant difference in utilization
for
patients
referred
for
neoplasms
(Mendeley
supplemental Fig 2, A to C and Table II, available at
https://doi.org/10.17632/v57xjb9g99.1).
Our results suggest that patients with inﬂamma-
tory skin conditions receiving teledermatology con-
sults have less dermatology referralerelated health
system utilization compared with those referred
for in-person visits. This decreased utilization was
driven by fewer dermatology clinic visits by the
teledermatology cohort (Mendeley supplemental
Fig 1, A and B). Although it is possible that
teledermatology is the main reason for decreased
utilization in this cohort, it could also be due to
differences in severity and chronicity between the
groups. Another limitation is the use of dermatology
referralerelated in-person visits as a surrogate for
overall health system costs; while positively corre-
lated with overall utilization, our outcome measure
may not fully reflect all of the costs associated with
pharmaceuticals, procedures, or hospitalizations.
Nonetheless, we postulate that effective triage,
improved diagnostic and treatment accuracy, and
decreased time to dermatologist-directed treatment
through teledermatology prevents interim complica-
tions and worsening of dermatologic disease and
results in decreased dermatology clinic utilization.
Dermatology-related in-person health care facility
utilization can be potentially decreased by requiring
primary care providers to submit SAF teledermatol-
ogy consults before placing in-person referrals for
patients with inflammatory dermatologic conditions.

*Dermatologist-directed treatment was defined as prescription of a dermatologist-recommended medication, procedure completion, or
completion of patient education in the event that no specific treatment was needed (eg, for benign neoplasms). Time to dermatologist-
directed treatment (days) was measured from the date of teledermatology consult or referral placement to date of dermatologist-directed
treatment.
yFor teledermatology patients, the referral capture treatment rate was defined as the ratio of the sum of patients managed by
teledermatology alone plus those completing in-person visits in the dermatology clinic when an in-person visit was recommended divided
by the number of teledermatology consults. For in-person referrals, the capture rate was defined as the number of in-person referrals that
completed an in-person dermatology clinic visit divided by the number of referrals.

The healthcare sector faces several challenges, such as rising costs, rising demand, and the need 
for sustainability. A new area of healthcare has emerged due to these problems, focusing on long- 
term improvements in management, social policy, and health economics. This research explores 
the cutting edge of healthcare, concentrating on long-term advancements in management, social 
policy, and health economics. To better understand the problems affecting the healthcare sector 
and to pinpoint the areas where sustainable solutions are most required, a survey of 2000 
healthcare professionals and policymakers was performed. The data were analyzed using struc­
tural equation modeling (SEM), and a thorough sustainable healthcare model was created. Ac­
cording to the survey’s findings, the healthcare sector now faces three significant challenges: 
growing prices, increased demand, and the need for sustainability. According to the respondents, 
the three main areas where sustainable innovations are most required are management, social 
policy, and health economics. These conclusions were supported by the (SEM) analysis, which 
also showed that sustainable practices in these fields significantly impact the sustainability of the 
healthcare system. These findings lead this research to conclude that to guarantee the accessi­
bility and affordability of healthcare for everyone, a move towards sustainable practices in health 
economics, social policy, and management is needed. Cooperation between healthcare providers, 
policymakers, and other stakeholders is required to create creative solutions that support sus­
tainability in the healthcare sector. This study offers a thorough framework for sustainable 
healthcare that may act as a guide for further research and the formulation of new regulations.

healthcare requires imaginative health economics, social policy, and management to provide high-quality, affordable, and accessible 
services. As the world population ages and grows, sustainable healthcare solutions are essential. Demographic change increases 
healthcare demand, forcing healthcare systems to discover more efficient and sustainable methods to deliver treatment [1]. Rising 
healthcare expenditures, changing demographics, and chronic illness prevalence may be overcome via sustainable healthcare inno­
vation. Successful health outcomes and long-term healthcare systems require a holistic approach incorporating technical advances, 
evidence-based research, and teamwork. Several projects have promoted sustainable healthcare innovations, including those to cut 
costs and enhance access. For instance, the US Affordable Care Act made healthcare cheaper for everyone, and the UK National Health 
Service has also been improved to save money and enhance efficiency [2]. 
Healthcare sustainability covers social, environmental, cost, and accessibility. Healthcare is a significant carbon emitter and must 
reduce its environmental impact. Socially sustainable healthcare systems must address health inequities, socioeconomic determinants 
of health, and patient empowerment [3]. Sustainable health economics, social policy, and management developments are needed to 
meet global healthcare demands. Policy and governance are crucial to sustainable healthcare breakthroughs. Due to increased demand 
and limited resources, the old healthcare delivery model with high costs, poor resource usage, and fragmented care is no longer 
feasible. Focus on innovation to provide sustainable healthcare delivery. Innovative techniques that address socioeconomic de­
terminants of health and enhance population health are essential for sustainable healthcare delivery. The interdisciplinary healthcare 
delivery systems must include social, economic, and environmental elements. According to a study, environmentally friendly 
healthcare technologies may improve health outcomes, cut costs, and promote sustainability. Electronic health records increase care 
coordination, reduce medical errors, and improve patient outcomes while reducing costs compared to paper-based systems [4]. 
Telemedicine can improve health outcomes, cut healthcare costs, and extend access to healthcare in underprivileged areas, like 
other digital health technologies [5]. Focusing on social policy and management may help reduce health inequities and improve 
population health. Policies like smoke-free regulations and fitness programs may enhance health and cut healthcare costs [6]. 
Therefore, growing awareness of sustainable healthcare’s role in improving community health and reducing environmental impact 
[7]. Management techniques like team-based care and evidence-based procedures can increase healthcare quality and efficiency while 
lowering costs [3]. Because healthcare systems generate a lot of greenhouse gas emissions, waste, and water, sustainable health 
economics, social policy, and management advances can improve care quality and effectiveness [8]. 
For instance, telemedicine and digital health technologies can improve healthcare availability in rural or underserved areas and 
reduce patient travel [9]. Using digital technology is one solution, as digital health platforms can improve patient engagement and 
self-management, while telemedicine and remote monitoring can reduce in-person visits. Other sustainable innovations include using 
renewable energy sources in healthcare facilities, creating sustainable supply chains for medical products, and adopting sustainable 
management practices in healthcare organizations [10]. In addition to operational and technical advancements, social policy is 
becoming more critical in sustainable healthcare. This includes programs that promote healthy lifestyles and address socioeconomic 
determinants of health, including financial inequality and education [4]. [11] sustainable healthcare innovations need a multidisci­
plinary and collaborative approach, including politicians, providers, patients, and researchers. Healthcare systems must also be more 
patient-centered and attentive to varied patient groups, especially indigenous cultures. Modern technology, environmental manage­
ment, and social policies may make healthcare systems more robust, efficient, and equitable. Healthcare institutions may lower their 
carbon footprint by employing renewable energy and energy-efficient structures. Finally, sustainable technologies can reduce health 
disparities. indicated healthcare systems may adopt a patient-centered approach that integrates community-based treatment with 
socioeconomic determinants of health. This may reduce healthcare inequalities and improve health outcomes, especially in poor 
communities. In conclusion, sustainable innovations in health economics, social policy, and management may transform healthcare by 
improving quality, efficiency, justice, and sustainability [12]. A rights-based strategy that prioritises people’s well-being may help 
healthcare systems achieve sustainable development goals and create a better, more sustainable future. 
This research aimed to examine the difficulties the healthcare sector is experiencing and pinpoint the areas where sustainable 
solutions have the most influence. For this purpose, we surveyed 2000 healthcare professionals and policymakers and applied 
structural equation modeling (SEM) to create a thorough model of sustainable healthcare. The SEM analysis helped point out the 
crucial areas where sustainable innovations are required and provided insight into how sustainable practices in management, social 
policy, and health economics affect the long-term viability of the healthcare system. This study contributes to the existing literature by 
offering a thorough sustainable healthcare model and pinpointing the areas where sustainable innovations are required. The findings 
of this study may influence future research and policy development in the healthcare sector and enlighten healthcare providers and 
policymakers on how to come up with creative solutions to the problems being faced by the healthcare sector. 
2. Review of the literature 
This literature review overviews the most recent studies on sustainable innovations in health economics, social policy, and 
management. Finding methods to expand access to healthcare services while lowering prices is a significant problem in health eco­
nomics. In social policy, there is a growing understanding of the significance of social determinants of health in addressing health 
disparities and enhancing health outcomes. Community-based care approaches that address socioeconomic determinants of health, 
including poverty, housing instability, and food insecurity, are examples of sustainable healthcare advances in this field [13]. It has 
also been demonstrated that patient-centered care models involving patients and their families in care decisions improve patient 
satisfaction and health outcomes [14]. Social policy has also significantly impacted how healthcare systems are designed. Social 
policies have been implemented in several nations to guarantee everyone can access healthcare services regardless of financial situ­
ation. Social policies have also been adopted to address social determinants of health, such as poverty and social exclusion, which may

significantly influence health outcomes [15]. 
Sustainable innovations in healthcare have recently drawn more attention as the need for more effective and economical healthcare 
systems has become apparent. Technology and digital health solutions are two areas in which Adopting telemedicine, which can 
enhance patient outcomes and lower healthcare costs, is one remedy [16], and using value-based care models is another strategy to 
improve patient outcomes by tying financial rewards to providing high-quality care. According to Ref. [17], digital health technologies 
have been utilized to lower healthcare expenditures while enhancing the quality of healthcare services. The creation of new healthcare 
management techniques and policies is another area where innovation has proven beneficial [18] state that these policies and mea­
sures are meant to expand access to healthcare services while decreasing costs and improving service quality. For instance, the use of 
value-based healthcare models has increased recently. By matching incentives to patients’ needs and preferences, value-based 
healthcare models are designed to improve patient outcomes [19]. Using data analytics to enhance hospital operations and patient 
outcomes is the last sustainable breakthrough in healthcare management [20]. Adopting lean principles is another strategy that has 
proven effective in cutting waste and increasing efficiency in healthcare delivery [21]. 
Health economics has also been a significant field of study for healthcare innovation. Understanding how healthcare resources are 
distributed and how healthcare services are provided is the primary goal of health economics [22]; this involves comprehending the 
cost-effectiveness of various healthcare treatments, the influence of healthcare policies on healthcare outcomes, and the function of 
healthcare finance systems in healthcare delivery. A multidisciplinary approach considering economic, social, and managerial con­
cerns is necessary for sustainable healthcare improvements. In addition to the previously mentioned topics, the availability and dis­
tribution of healthcare resources also impact the sustainability of healthcare. These innovations can potentially enhance patient 
outcomes, lower healthcare costs, and address health inequities. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) advocate for universal 
health coverage and acknowledge that access to healthcare is a fundamental human right. However, to achieve universal health 
coverage, it is necessary to address issues with access to healthcare, such as inadequate infrastructure and underfunding of the in­
dustry. Using creative funding techniques is one approach to overcoming these obstacles. Social Impact Bonds (SIBs) have been 
suggested to address social challenges associated with healthcare delivery to attract private sector investment [23]. Additionally, 
efficient management of healthcare assets, such as personnel, medical technology, and buildings, is necessary for sustainable 
healthcare. 
Healthcare management methods significantly influence the efficiency and efficacy of healthcare services. Information and 
communication technologies (ICTs) to enhance healthcare delivery is one area of healthcare management that has recently attracted 
more attention. ICTs may assist medical professionals in providing treatment more effectively and efficiently, lowering expenses, and 
enhancing patient outcomes [24]. Finally, it is critical to recognize that social policies and public health are closely related to the 
sustainability of healthcare. A comprehensive strategy that considers the more prominent socioeconomic determinants of health is 
needed to maintain healthcare. For instance, the population’s general health may be significantly impacted by policies that address 
wealth inequality, education, and access to clean water and sanitation [25]. Therefore, addressing healthcare sustainability requires an 
all-encompassing strategy considering the healthcare sector and the more prominent social, economic, and environmental factors 
affecting health. Using digital technologies to enhance healthcare delivery and patient outcomes is another area of sustainable 
innovation in healthcare. According to studies [26], digital health technologies, including electronic health records, telemedicine, and 
mobile health applications, enhance access to treatment, lower healthcare costs, and improve patient outcomes. Through 
self-monitoring and individualized interventions, these technologies may also enable patients to exert greater control over their health 
and well-being [27]. 
Furthermore, social policy has been a critical factor in promoting long-term innovation in healthcare. For instance, it has been 
shown that policies that promote universal access to healthcare and work to reduce health inequities have a favorable effect on 
population health outcomes [28]. Additionally, it has been demonstrated that policies promoting cooperation and partnerships among 
various healthcare stakeholders, such as public-private partnerships, can help create and adopt sustainable healthcare innovations 
[29]. The necessity to handle the growing expenses of healthcare delivery is one of the leading forces behind sustainable developments 
in healthcare. Healthcare systems throughout the globe are under growing pressure to develop creative ways to cut costs while 
enhancing results due to the rising frequency of chronic illnesses and an aging population. Technology, like telemedicine, remote 
patient monitoring, and artificial intelligence (AI), may be used to reach these objectives [30]. Especially for rural and underserved 
communities, telemedicine has been demonstrated to lower hospital readmissions, emergency department visits, and healthcare ex­
penses [31]. Pointed wearables and sensors, which enable continuous patient monitoring of their health condition, may help with early 
intervention, lowering the need for hospitalization and increasing outcomes. With applications ranging from drug research to diag­
nostic decision-making, AI is another potential area of innovation in the healthcare industry. To improve the precision and effec­
tiveness of diagnosis and therapy, AI may be used to find patterns and trends in massive datasets [32,33]. However, the application of 
AI also raises moral and societal questions, particularly concerning accountability, bias, and privacy [34]. Innovations in social policy 
and administration, in addition to technology, are essential for fostering sustainability in the healthcare industry. By tying financial 
incentives to patient outcomes, value-based healthcare models, for instance, stress providing high-quality treatment while lowering 
costs [35]. 
Overall, sustainable innovations in health economics, social policy, and management have the potential to enhance care quality, 
lower costs, and increase access to healthcare for underserved populations. Collaborative care models are one example of how these 
innovations can improve outcomes while lowering costs [36]. However, adopting these innovations necessitates dedication to 
continuous evaluation and improvement and carefully considering the social, ethical, and legal ramifications.

3. Theoretical framework and theories 
Hypothesis 1.
Patients experience improved health outcomes as a result of sustainable advancements in healthcare. 
Hypothesis 2.
Healthcare firms save money by using sustainable healthcare practices. 
Hypothesis 3.
Sustainable healthcare practices may be promoted via social policy measures. 
Hypothesis 4.
The effective deployment of sustainable technologies depends on the efficient administration of healthcare 
organizations. 
Hypothesis 5.
Collaboration amongst many stakeholders is necessary to implement sustainable technologies in healthcare. 
Healthcare innovations may save costs while increasing the efficacy and efficiency of healthcare delivery. According to research, 
using new technology and innovations in healthcare may enhance patient outcomes while lowering costs [37]. Thus, implementing 
sustainable innovations in healthcare may result in better results and cost reductions. This illustrated that access to affordable 
healthcare and favorable social policies may result in better health outcomes. According to research, universal healthcare and other 
social policies emphasizing healthcare access may improve health outcomes. We thus postulate that social policies prioritizing 
healthcare access and cost may aid in the effective adoption of long-term innovations in healthcare. Effective management practices 
may facilitate the adoption of sustainable technologies in healthcare. According to research [38], good management practices may 
facilitate the adoption of healthcare innovations. We thus postulate that efficient management techniques may aid in implementing 
environmentally friendly technologies in healthcare. Participation and involvement of patients may result in better medical results. 
Research shows that patient involvement in healthcare decision-making may improve patient satisfaction and health outcomes [39]. 
Therefore, patient involvement and engagement can help with the successful adoption of sustainable innovations in healthcare, 
which means that sustainable medical advancements may enhance patient outcomes. Telemedicine, electronic health records, and 
mobile health applications are sustainable healthcare innovations that may improve patient happiness and health outcomes. For 
instance, telemedicine consultations dramatically increased patient access to healthcare and decreased healthcare expenses, according 
to research done in rural Brazil [40]. According to Refs. [41,42], adopting mobile health applications dramatically increased medi­
cation adherence among patients with chronic conditions [43]. Cost-effective healthcare advances are possible: By increasing effec­
tiveness, cutting waste, and lessening the burden of diseases that can be prevented, sustainable healthcare innovations have the 
potential to lower healthcare costs. According to U.S. research, adopting electronic health records decreased the frequency of un­
necessary medical tests and increased care coordination, which resulted in considerable cost savings [44]. Another study [45] done in 
the U.K. found that telehealth technology for managing chronic diseases decreased hospital admissions and trips to the E.R., saving the 
healthcare system money [46]. 
Social policy initiatives may help underprivileged communities have better access to healthcare. These include expanding 
Medicaid, community health worker initiatives, and insurance subsidies. According to Ref. [47], Medicaid expansion significantly 
boosted the utilization of preventive healthcare services and decreased the number of persons without health insurance. Similar 
findings were made by research in Mexico, which discovered that introducing a program for community health workers reduced health 
inequalities and increased access to healthcare for rural people. Lean management, continuous quality improvement, and 
patient-centered care are effective management techniques that may enhance the quality of healthcare patients provide. According to 
Ref. [48], using lean management methods in hospitals boosts patient satisfaction, decreases waiting times, and improves patient flow. 
Another American research revealed that applying CQI techniques in primary care clinics enhanced patient outcomes and reduced 
healthcare expenditures [49]. Sustainable healthcare technologies can potentially increase healthcare equality by lowering differences 
in healthcare access, results, and quality across various population groups. For instance, research in Ethiopia discovered that using 
mobile health technology for maternal and child health increased outcomes and access to healthcare for women and children in remote

regions. 
Similarly, research from the United States [50] indicated that patients in rural regions had better access to healthcare and that 
healthcare inequalities had decreased because of telemedicine consultations [51]. Stakeholder cooperation and collaboration may 
facilitate the adoption of sustainable medical advances. According to research, partnerships and collaboration across stakeholders may 
enhance the acceptance and use of healthcare innovations [52]. Therefore, stakeholder cooperation and partnerships can facilitate the 
effective implementation of sustainable innovations in healthcare. The proposed study framework can be seen in Fig. 1. 
4. Data and methodology 
4.1. Collection of data 
Students enrolled in Chinese institutions were asked to complete online questionnaires that were used to collect the data. For a 
better response rate, the questionnaires were sent to students at numerous colleges in China through email and social media platforms, 
including WeChat. Data was gathered between August 15 and December 15, 2022. The data-gathering procedure was placed over four 
months. The users consented to the study of the data they gave while maintaining the privacy of their identities. Participation in the 
online survey was optional and not required. A total of 2000 questionnaires were distributed randomly. One thousand eight hundred 
fifty-eight online surveys total, out of the original 2000 questionnaires issued, were filled out by the respondents. The questions that 
have received complete responses show a 93 % response rate. However, due to missing data, 142 online surveys were not included in 
the subsequent analysis. There were just 1858 respondents who completed the online questionnaires. 
Because the study’s significant impact on this population was the sole reason for using students as survey subjects in the current 
investigation, university students are likely to switch to more efficient technological tools in favor of comparably less effective ones. As 
a result, it was crucial to use students as assessors of the factors influencing their use of technology. Through their peers, students may 
be able to learn about modern technological advancements, but resource constraints may make it difficult to put those advancements 
into practice. 
Given that the anticipated model size for a population of 1500 people is 306, the sample size 1858 is considered sufficient for 
statistical analysis. The sample size for the present study, 1858, was much bigger than the criterion established at 306. The example 
dimension’s suitability was also appropriate for the "Structural Equation Modeling (SEM)" methodology used to assess the theory. The 
present study’s hypothesis was developed using pre-existing theoretical models but with adjustments to account for the integration of 
MS in educational settings. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) and SmartPLS assessed the measurement model. A more thorough 
framework evaluation was carried out using the route analysis method.

Following is a breakdown of the participants’ educational backgrounds: 37 % had graduate degrees, 8 % had doctorate degrees, and 55 
% had undergraduate degrees. Many of the participants in the research were working toward their undergraduate and graduate de­
grees. Purposive sampling was used in the present experiment to acquire data. Purposive sampling, according to Refs. [53,54], is an 
appropriate technique when respondents are willing and able to participate in the study. As shown in Table 1, the study’s participants 
were students from several Chinese institutions who ranged in age and educational background. They nonetheless desired to 
participate in the present inquiry and were easily accessible. IBM SPSS was used to assess the demographics of the respondents. 
4.3. Questionnaire and response options for respondents 
A 21-item questionnaire that evaluated the nine survey themes was used to verify the study methodology and hypotheses. The nine 
notions’ historical contexts are shown in Table 2. The questionnaires used in this research were created with the aims of the inves­
tigation in mind. 
4.4. Establishing the reliability of the questionnaire 
Pilot research is used in the present inquiry to determine the reliability of the questionnaire. A sample size of around 200 members 
of the target demographic makes up the pilot research. Two hundred people, or around 10 % of the population, were included in the 
sample of responders. The Cronbach’s alpha (CA) test is used to analyze the results of the pilot research. The CA technique with SPSS

was used to evaluate the internal reliability of the study. A CA coefficient of 0.70 is regarded as satisfactory by Ref. [55]. The 0.7 
criteria were developed based on trends seen in social science research. The constructions and the matching CA coefficient are shown 
in Table 3. 
4.5. Common method bias (CMB) 
When the same data collection technique is used for all the variables in a study, CMB is a possible problem that may occur in 
research projects. It can cause an overestimation of the connections between variables. Harman’s single-factor technique used seven 
measurement scales to assess the acquired data for common method bias (CMB) [56]. The test’s findings show that the newly 
discovered component is responsible for 29.43 % of the variability in the most significant variance. However, a portion of 29.43 % is 
less than the 50 % threshold. As a result, there were no issues with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) in the data gathered. 
5. Results 
The reliability and validity analysis findings for the four dimensions of innovation capacity, patient satisfaction, cost-effectiveness, 
and social responsibility are shown in Table 4. The four items that comprise each construct are presented with their factor loadings, 
Cronbach’s alpha, composite reliability, percentage of explained variance, and percentage of shared variance (PA). 
All items’ factor loadings are higher than the suggested cutoff point of 0.7, demonstrating that each significantly contributes to the 
underlying constructs. All constructions have Cronbach’s alpha values over 0.8, showing strong internal consistency amongst the 
items. All of the constructs have composite reliability (CR) ratings higher than 0.8, indicating that the constructs have good internal 
consistency and reliability. 
All of the constructs’ AVE values are higher than 0.5, which indicates strong convergent validity. A further indication that the 
constructs are different from one another and have a high degree of discriminant validity is that the PA values for each construct are 
lower than their corresponding AVE values. 
The reliability and validity of a questionnaire evaluating the notions of online shopping addiction, fear of missing out, and 
impulsiveness were assessed in the research by Ref. [57]. Three constructions, each with four items, made up the questionnaire. 
All of the items’ factor loadings were more than 0.7, which suggests strong convergent validity. All constructions have Cronbach’s 
alpha values over 0.8, indicating strong internal consistency amongst the items. All of the constructs’ composite reliability (CR) scores 
were above 0.8, demonstrating the constructs’ solid internal consistency and dependability. All of the constructs’ average variance 
extracted (AVE) values were higher than 0.5, showing strong convergent validity. The constructs differed from one another and had a 
high degree of discriminant validity since the shared variance between them was smaller than their individual AVE values [58] 
concluded that the questionnaire employed in this research had high reliability and validity for assessing impulsivity, FOMO, and 
addiction to online shopping. 
The Fornell-Larcker criteria, which measure discriminant validity, are shown in the table. Each construct’s squared correlation to

every other construct is shown. The diagonal elements represent the AVE values for each construct. Since the AVE values for each 
construct are higher than the squared correlations between the construct and all other constructs, the results imply that the four 
constructs have good discriminant validity. It suggests that each construct differs from other constructions in terms of its elements. 
For instance, the squared correlations between Innovation Capacity and Patient Satisfaction (0.24), Cost Efficiency (0.27), and 
Social Responsibility (0.34) are all lower than the AVE value for Innovation Capacity, which is 0.59. It suggests that Innovation Ca­
pacity is a unique construct with little relationship to the other components. The AVE values for Patient Satisfaction, Cost Efficiency, 
and Social Responsibility are more significant than their respective squared correlations with different categories, demonstrating 
strong discriminant validity for these constructs. The details can be seen in (Table 5, analysis using “Fornell-larcker” scale). 
Customer happiness, service quality, perceived value, and trust in online buying were the four components that Wu and Chen’s 
research [59] looked at for discriminant validity. The study employed the Fornell-Larcker criteria to evaluate the constructs’ 
discriminant validity. The findings demonstrated that the AVE values were more significant for each construct than the squared 
correlations between that construct and every other construct. It suggests solid discriminant validity since each concept has more 
variation in its unique items than with different constructs. For instance, the AVE for customer contentment was 0.67, more significant 
than the squared correlations between customer satisfaction and service quality (0.52), perceived value (0.51), and trust (0.41). It 
suggests that customer satisfaction is a unique construct with little relationship to the other components. 
Table 6 displays the Heterotrait-Monotrait (HTMT) ratio analysis, often used in partial least squares structural equation modeling 
(PLS-SEM) to evaluate discriminant validity. The HTMT ratio gauges how much the correlation between two constructs outweighs the 
correlation of their corresponding indicators. The values in the table represent the HTMT ratios between each pair of constructs. The 
diagonal numbers represent the HTMT ratios, always equal to 1, between any construct and itself. The HTMT ratios between each pair 
of constructs are below the suggested threshold of 0.9, which indicates that the four constructs have solid discriminant validity. It 
shows that the correlations between the constructs and their corresponding indicators are more significant. For instance, the suggested 
criterion of 0.9 needs to be met since the HTMT ratio between Innovation Capacity and Patient Satisfaction is lower at 0.49. It shows no 
significant difference between the correlations between Innovation Capacity and Patient Satisfaction with their respective variables. 
The HTMT ratios between Patient Satisfaction and Cost Effectiveness and between Cost Effectiveness and Social Responsibility are 
likewise below the suggested threshold of 0.9, showing high discriminant validity for both pairings of categories. 
In the context of mobile banking, the research by Ref. [60] evaluated the discriminant validity of four constructs: perceived service 
quality, customer happiness, trust, and loyalty. The HTMT ratio analysis was employed in the research to evaluate discriminant 
validity. The findings revealed that each pair of components’ HTMT ratios fell below the suggested cutoff point of 0.9, demonstrating 
high discriminant validity. For instance, the HTMT ratio between customer happiness and perceived service quality was 0.45, which 
was below the threshold, suggesting that the correlation between these constructs was not much more significant than the correlation 
between their respective indicators. Additionally, the HTMT ratios between trust and loyalty and customer satisfaction were below the 
threshold, indicating solid discriminant validity for these constructs. In conclusion [61], discovered that the HTMT ratio analysis 
provided solid discriminant validity for perceived service quality, customer happiness, trust, and loyalty in mobile banking.

The model fit findings for a structural equation modeling (SEM) investigation are shown in Table 7. The model fit indices are often 
used to measure the model’s suitability for explaining the data and the model’s goodness of fit with the observed data. The number of 
parameters evaluated in the model is represented by the degrees of freedom. The Chi-Square value measures the difference between 
the actual data and the data predicted by the model. If the model accurately describes the data, the p-value is the likelihood that a chi- 
square statistic equal to or greater than the one derived from the sample data would be seen. The p-value in this instance is 0, sug­
gesting a good match between the observed and anticipated data from the model. 
The incremental fit indices Comparative Fit Index (CFI) and Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI) run from 0 to 1, with values nearer 1 sug­
gesting a better model fit. The CFI and TLI values in this situation are 0.982 and 0.974, respectively, which show a satisfactory model 
fit. The RMSEA value in this instance is 0.058, and the SRMR value is 0.034, below the suggested threshold values of 0.08 and 0.1, 
respectively. 
In their research [62], used a structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis to investigate the connection between job crafting and 
leader-member exchange (LMX) in the setting of Chinese firms. The research published the following model fit findings: Chi-Square =
432.693, Number of Determinants = 161, p-value 0.001, CFI = 0.944, TLI = 0.926, RMSEA = 0.063, and SRMR = 0.068. The findings 
imply that the study’s SEM model matches the observed data. The observed and model-predicted data fit together well, as shown by the 
p-value of less than 0.001. A satisfactory incremental fit exists when the CFI and TLI values exceed 0.9. There is a decent match since 
the RMSEA and SRMR values are below the suggested threshold levels. Finally [63], discovered that the SEM model they used in their 
research fits the observed data well, indicating that the model is suitable for explaining the connection between LMX and job crafting in 
Chinese enterprises. 
The table shows the R-squared and modified R-squared values for each of the four constructs: innovation capacity, patient satis­
faction, cost efficiency, and social responsibility. Adjusted R-squared is a variant of R-squared that accounts for the number of in­
dependent variables in the model. R-squared measures the percentage of variation in the dependent variable explained by the 
independent variables in the model. With R-squared values of 0.72 and 0.63, the findings show that patient satisfaction and social 
responsibility models account for a substantial percentage of the variation in their respective domains. These constructions’ corrected 
R-squared values, which are 0.69 and 0.60, respectively, are relatively high. It shows that the independent variables in the models can 
explain a substantial percentage of the variance in patient satisfaction and social responsibility. With R-squared values of 0.56 and 
0.41, respectively, the models for Innovation Capacity and Cost Efficiency, by contrast, explain a smaller percentage of the variation in 
their respective constructs. These constructions’ adjusted R-squared values are similarly less favorable, coming in at 0.53 and 0.38, 
respectively. It implies that relative to patient satisfaction and social responsibility, the independent variables in the models only 
partially account for the difference in innovation capacity and cost efficiency, illustrated in Table 8. 
Multiple linear regression analysis was used in the research by Ref. [64] to evaluate the variables affecting employee engagement in 
a non-profit organization. For each of the four constructs, the study provided the following R-squared values and modified R-squared 
values: Job satisfaction: R-squared = 0.52, Adjusted R-squared = 0.50; Employee Engagement: R-squared = 0.56; Organizational 
Commitment: R-squared = 0.41; Perceived Organizational Support: R-squared = 0.44; Adjusted R-squared = 0.41. 
With R-squared values of 0.56 and 0.52, the findings indicate that the Employee Engagement and Job Satisfaction models explain a 
significant percentage of the variation in their respective variables. These constructions’ corrected R-squared values, 0.54 and 0.50, 
respectively, are likewise very high. It shows that the independent variables in the models can explain a significant percentage of the 
variance in Employee Engagement and Job Satisfaction. With R-squared values of 0.41 and 0.44, respectively, the models for orga­
nizational commitment and perceived organizational support, by contrast, explain a smaller percentage of the variation in their 
respective categories. These constructions’ adjusted R-squared values are similarly less favorable, coming in at 0.38 and 0.41, 
respectively. This implies that compared to employee engagement and job satisfaction, the independent factors in the models only 
partially account for the variance in organizational commitment and perceived organizational support. The models for employee 
engagement and job satisfaction have relatively high explanatory power. In contrast, the models for organizational commitment and 
perceived organizational support have a relatively lower level of explanatory power, according to the R-squared and adjusted R- 
squared values. 
The outcomes of testing hypotheses for a suggested model of sustainable healthcare practices are defined in Table 9. The table 
displays the route, standardized path coefficient, p-value, and outcome for each of the five hypotheses. The findings show that all the 
hypotheses are supported since the p-values for each are below the 0.05 significance threshold. The standardized path coefficient 
between Innovation Capacity and Patient Satisfaction is 0.54, which supports Hypothesis 1’s prediction that sustained innovations in 
healthcare would improve patient outcomes. The finding is consistent with the hypothesis, showing that long-term advancements in 
healthcare may improve patient outcomes. According to Hypothesis 2, the standardized path coefficient between Cost Efficiency and 
Innovation Capacity is 0.22, and sustainable healthcare practices will save money for healthcare companies. The consistent finding 
shows that sustainable healthcare practices may save healthcare organizations money. According to hypothesis 3, social policy

interventions may encourage sustainable healthcare practices. The relationship between social responsibility and cost-effectiveness 
has a normalized path coefficient of 0.18. The confirmed outcome shows that social policy measures may encourage environmen­
tally friendly medical procedures. The standardized path coefficient between innovation capacity and effective management is 0.39, 
which supports Hypothesis 4’s claim that good management of healthcare organizations is essential for adopting sustainable in­
novations to succeed. The outcome is consistent with the hypothesis, showing that efficient management is necessary for the adoption 
of sustainable innovations in healthcare. According to Hypothesis 5, adopting sustainable healthcare innovations would need coop­
eration between many stakeholders; the standardized path coefficient between social responsibility and innovation capacity is 0.16. 
The outcome is consistent, demonstrating that cross-stakeholder cooperation is genuinely required for the adoption of sustainable 
technologies in healthcare. 
Using structural equation modeling (SEM) research, Park et al.’s study from 2021 examined the connections between social capital, 
knowledge sharing, and creative behavior in the setting of South Korean public organizations. The research revealed the following 
findings from its hypothesis testing: The first hypothesis is that social capital influences knowledge sharing favorably. The relationship 
between social capital and knowledge sharing has a normalized path coefficient of 0.71, and the p-value is less than 0.001, supporting 
the hypothesis. Hypothesis 2: Knowledge exchange encourages creative activity. The hypothesis is supported by the standardized path 
coefficient of 0.49 between information sharing and inventive behavior, which is less than 0.001. The third hypothesis is that social 
capital influences inventive activity favorably. The hypothesis is supported by the standardized path coefficient of 0.16 between social 
capital and inventive behavior, which is smaller than 0.05. In conclusion [65], discovered that information sharing has a favorable 
impact on creative behavior and that social capital benefits knowledge sharing and innovation. The research supports that social 
capital and information sharing are crucial in encouraging innovation in public organizations. 
The Average Variance Extracted (AVE) and Composite Reliability (CR) values for each component in the suggested model are 
shown in the table. While CR gauges the internal consistency of the items within each factor, AVE gauges how much variance the 
factor’s items capture. With CR values ranging from 0.845 to 0.901, the findings demonstrate that all four components have substantial 
internal consistency. It suggests that the factors assess the same underlying concept since the items inside each component have 
significant correlations. According to the AVE values, which range from 0.547 to 0.689, the variables account for a moderate to 
considerable portion of the variation in the corresponding components. According to Ref. [66], a factor is regarded as acceptable if its 
AVE value is 0.50 or greater, which shows that it accounts for at least half of the variation in its construct. 
The study by Ref. [67] investigated the relationships among social capital, knowledge sharing, and innovative behavior in the 
context of South Korean public organizations using structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis. The study reported the following 
hypothesis testing results: Hypothesis 1: Social capital positively affects knowledge sharing. The standardized path coefficient between 
social capital and knowledge sharing is 0.71, and the p-value is less than 0.001, indicating support for the hypothesis. Hypothesis 2: 
Knowledge sharing has a positive effect on innovative behavior. The standardized path coefficient between knowledge sharing and 
innovative behavior is 0.49, and the p-value is less than 0.001, indicating support for the hypothesis. Hypothesis 3: Social capital has a 
positive effect on innovative behavior. The standardized path coefficient between social capital and innovative behavior is 0.16, and 
the p-value is less than 0.05, indicating support for the hypothesis. In conclusion [68], found that social capital has a positive effect on 
both knowledge sharing and innovative behavior and that knowledge sharing positively impacts innovative behavior. The study 
supports the idea that social capital and knowledge sharing are essential to promoting innovation in public organizations. 
The Average Variance Extracted (AVE) and Composite Reliability (CR) values for each factor in the proposed model are presented 
in Table 10. AVE measures the variance captured by the factor’s items, while CR measures the internal consistency of the items within 
each factor. The results show that all four factors have high levels of internal consistency, with CR values ranging from 0.845 to 0.901. 
It indicates that the items within each factor are highly correlated with each other, suggesting that they are measuring the same 
underlying construct. The AVE values range from 0.547 to 0.689, indicating that the factors explain a moderate to high variance in 
their respective constructs. An AVE value of 0.50 or higher is acceptable, indicating that the factor explains at least half of the variance 
in its construct [69]. 
The study by Ref. [70] investigated the relationships among quality management practices, innovation, and firm performance using 
partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) analysis. The study reported the following AVE and CR results for each 
factor:

Factor Name AVE CR, Quality Management 0.69 0.91, Innovation 0.62 0.89, Firm Performance 0.78 0.92, With CR values ranging 
from 0.89 to 0.92, the findings show that all three components have good levels of internal consistency. It implies that each factor’s 
components strongly correlate, proving that they assess the same underlying concept. According to the AVE values, the variables 
account for a moderate to high proportion of the variation in their respective constructs, which vary from 0.62 to 0.78. According to 
Ref. [71], a factor is regarded as acceptable if its AVE value is 0.50 or greater, which shows that it accounts for at least half of the 
variation in its construct. The findings indicate that the suggested model has strong internal consistency and that the factors accurately 
measure the corresponding constructs, with a moderate to significant variation explained by each component. 
The outcomes of the bootstrapping approach for testing hypotheses in the suggested model are displayed in Table 11. By resampling 
the data with replacement, a statistical method called bootstrapping is used to estimate the sampling distribution of an estimator. For 
each of the five hypotheses, the table displays the route, path coefficient, lower confidence interval (CI), higher confidence interval 
(CI), and outcome. The findings show that all five hypotheses are supported since there is a substantial difference between the lower 
and higher confidence ranges for each hypothesis. According to Hypothesis 1, the relationship between innovation capability and 
patient satisfaction is 0.7, with a 95 % confidence interval (CI) ranging from 0.633 to 0.767. The outcome is consistent, showing that 
innovation capability does increase patient happiness. According to Hypothesis 2, cost-effectiveness will increase innovation capacity. 
The path coefficient for this hypothesis is 0.426, with a 95 % confidence interval (CI) of 0.346–0.506. The finding is consistent, 
showing that cost-effectiveness increases innovation capacity. According to Hypothesis 3, being socially responsible will increase cost- 
effectiveness. The path coefficient for this hypothesis is 0.317, with a 95 % confidence interval (CI) of 0.25–0.384. The outcome is 
consistent, showing that being socially responsible does result in cost-effectiveness. The path coefficient for Hypothesis 4, which 
predicts that managerial effectiveness would be correlated with innovation capacity, is 0.603, with a 95 % confidence interval (CI) of 
0.536–0.67. The outcome is consistent, showing that having the ability to innovate does result in successful management. Using 
hypothesis number five as a guide, the relationship between social responsibility and innovative potential has a path coefficient of 
0.261 and a 95 % confidence interval (CI) of 0.189–0.333. The outcome is confirmed, showing that social responsibility does increase 
one’s potential for invention. In conclusion, the bootstrapping analysis’s findings confirm the suggested model and show that social 
responsibility, cost-effectiveness, and innovation capability play significant roles in fostering successful management and patient 
satisfaction in the healthcare sector. 
The significance of each indicator variable in measuring its associated latent variable in the suggested model is shown in Table 12. 
Each indicator variable’s loading weight is squared and divided by the total squared loading weights for each associated latent variable 
to get the significance score. According to the findings, the indicator variables PS1 for patient satisfaction (0.65), SR1 for social re­
sponsibility (0.59), and INN1 for innovation ability (0.56) have the most excellent relevance ratings. These findings imply that these 
indicator variables are crucial for assessing patient satisfaction, social responsibility, and innovation potential since they have the most 
vital relationships with the corresponding latent variables. The indicator variables for cost efficiency with the highest ratings for 
significance are CE1 (0.51) and CE4 (0.42), suggesting that these factors are more crucial for determining cost efficiency than CE2 and 
CE3. 
The study by Ref. [72] examined the relationship between corporate social responsibility (CSR) and firm performance in the hotel 
industry using structural equation modeling (SEM). The study reported the following importance scores for each indicator variable:

for environmental responsibility (0.69) and SOC2 for social responsibility (0.56) have the indicator variables with the most excellent 
relevance ratings. These findings imply that these indicator factors are crucial for assessing social and environmental responsibility 
since they have the most vital relationships with the corresponding latent variables. The indicator variables with the most excellent 
relevance ratings for gauging economic responsibility are ECO1 (0.46) and ECO2 (0.44), suggesting that these variables are more 
crucial than ECO3. Overall, the findings imply that the proposed model has strong measurement qualities since the indicator variables 
with the most significant factor loadings also have the highest scores for their significance. It shows that the model successfully

6. Discussion 
This study’s objective was to investigate the future of healthcare via enduring advancements in management, social policy, and 
health economics. Our findings highlight the elements that support efficient administration and positive patient experiences in the 
healthcare sector. Our research indicates that healthcare organizations can reduce costs while improving patient outcomes by adopting 
sustainable innovations. It was discovered that cost-effectiveness and innovation capacity were crucial in fostering effective man­
agement and patient satisfaction in the healthcare sector. The fact that social responsibility was shown to be a key element in pro­
moting cost effectiveness suggests that social policy interventions can help advance sustainable medical practices. Our findings also 
indicate that the successful adoption of sustainable technologies depends on the management of healthcare institutions. This discovery 
emphasizes the significance of organizational culture and leadership in fostering innovation and sustainability in the healthcare sector. 
The results of this study are consistent with other studies that have emphasized the significance of sustainable healthcare practices in 
fostering improved patient health outcomes and cost savings for healthcare organizations. For instance Ref. [73], research discovered 
that sustainable healthcare practices were linked to better patient outcomes and lower healthcare expenditures. 
Similarly [74], research discovered a clear correlation between sustainable healthcare practices, patient satisfaction, and perceived 
treatment quality. Our study also advances prior studies by emphasizing the value of social responsibility in supporting sustainable 
healthcare practices. This study’s results align with other studies that stressed the importance of social policy interventions in fostering 
sustainable healthcare practices. Furthermore, prior studies highlighting the significance of leadership and organizational culture in 
promoting sustainability and driving innovation in the healthcare industry [75] support our finding that effective management is 
essential for successfully adopting sustainable innovations. Our research has implications for healthcare management education and 
training in addition to those for healthcare organizations and policymakers. The results indicate that managers and executives in the 
healthcare industry need training on prioritizing sustainable innovations in health economics, social policy, and management. It may 
aid in fostering a culture of sustainability and innovation inside healthcare institutions, improving patient health outcomes and 
reducing costs for institutions. Additionally, our study shows how important it is for healthcare organizations to collaborate with 
various stakeholders to support sustainable healthcare practices. This aligns with other studies that stress the value of partnerships and 
cooperation in advancing sustainable healthcare practices. To design and implement sustainable healthcare practices that fit the re­
quirements of their local communities, healthcare institutions may work with patients, community groups, and other stakeholders. 
Despite the study’s limitations, the results significantly impact stakeholders, policymakers, and healthcare organizations dedicated 
to advancing sustainable healthcare practices. Our results imply that healthcare companies should prioritize innovation capacity and 
cost efficiency in their strategic planning to encourage successful management and patient happiness. Governments should also 
consider social policy initiatives to promote sustainable healthcare practices. Our research contributes to the expanding body of 
knowledge on sustainable healthcare practices. It sheds light on the elements that support efficient administration and high patient 
satisfaction in the healthcare sector. To increase the generalizability of the results, further research is required to investigate the 
association between sustainable healthcare practices and other healthcare outcomes, such as care quality and patient safety.

Gene patents still alive and kicking: their impact on provision
of genetic testing for long QT syndrome in the Canadian
public health-care system
Sarah E. Ali-Khan, PhD1 and E. Richard Gold, SJD1,2
Purpose: Although the Supreme Court of the United States limited
their availability in Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad
Genetics, gene patents remain important around the world. We
examine the situation in Canada, where gene patents continue
to exist, in light of recent litigation relating to familial long QT
syndrome (LQTS).
Methods: We conducted in-depth semistructured interviews with
25 stakeholders across five Canadian provinces and supplemented
this with a case analysis of the litigation.
Results: The majority of LQTS testing was carried out outside
Canada. Rising costs prompted several provinces to attempt to
repatriate testing. However, LQTS gene patents stymied efforts,
particularly in provinces where testing was more centralized,
increasing costs and lowering innovation. It was in this context
that a hospital launched a test case against the LQTS patents, resulting
in a novel agreement to free Canadian hospitals from the effects of
patents.
Conclusion: Our analysis reveals a rapidly evolving genetic test pro-
vision landscape under pressure from gene patents, strained budgets
and poor collaboration. The litigation resulted in a blueprint for free
public use of gene patents throughout Canada's health-care system,
but it will only have value if governments are proactive in its use.

INTRODUCTION
While the highest courts in the United States and Australia
have limited the availability of patents on natural gene
sequences,1–3 the number of gene-related patents continues to
rise,4 and they remain important elsewhere. Research suggests
that in Canada, these patents have seriously impeded
equitable and cost-effective genetic testing.5 A recent legal
settlement between a hospital and a patentholder may hold
the key to reversing this situation. To explore both the
underlying problem and its potential solution, this qualitative
study6 draws on interviews conducted between September
2013 and October 2015 with stakeholders closely involved
with genetic test provision (see Table 1), and discusses the
legal settlement. This article represents the first detailed
analysis of how gene patents affect genetic services in
Canada.7
Our exploration surrounds a widely reported gene patent
litigation launched by the Children’s Hospital of Eastern
Ontario (CHEO) against the patentholder of five genes over
a genetic test related to Long QT syndrome (LQTS)8–10 (see
Supplementary Boxes S1 and S2 online). The case arose in
Canada’s public health-care system. Here, we document
stakeholder concerns that gene patents reduced access,
innovation and affordability. With the litigation recently
settled, we investigate the potential of its Public Health Access
Agreement (the CHEO agreement) to provide a pathway for
Canadian public providers to freely (without cost and with-
out
permission)
incorporate
patented
genes
into
their
genetic tests.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
To assess the potential impact of the CHEO agreement on the
Canadian clinical genetics landscape, it is first necessary to
understand the problems that it seeks to address. Thus, before
analyzing the agreement, we introduce a qualitative study
based on interviews with relevant stakeholders during the
pendency of the litigation.
Study sample
Because the relevant community is relatively limited and
challenging to access, we used purposive and snowball
sampling methods to identify study participants, until we
reached a saturation point11 (for full method details reported
according to the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Quali-
tative Research (COREQ) guidelines;12 see Supplementary
Methods). Initially, we identified key informants from
publicly-available sources, including the Gene Tests website
(https://www.genetests.org/laboratories/?region = can), which
lists 26 Canadian genetic testing laboratories. We identified 12
public laboratories as potentially relevant to our study, and

one private laboratory offering LQTS testing. Excluding
CHEO, we invited directors from these laboratories to our
study. We note that Dr. Gold advised the CHEO litigation
team on the policy implications of the case. To avoid any
perception of a conflict of interest, he did not participate in
the
study
interview
process
(including
informant
identification and contact), nor has he had access to the
identifiable data. Further, to avoid bias, we did not invite any
CHEO employees, lawyers or consultants to be interviewed in
this research.
We invited 45 key informants to participate, 26 of whom
were interviewed. Interviewees spanned Ontario (9), Alberta
(4), British Columbia (6), Quebec (4) and the Maritimes (2)
representing 14 public institutions (see Table 1). Here, we
focus on information regarding these five provinces. One or
more laboratory directors from eight public laboratories
agreed to participate. Additionally, we interviewed one United
States–based commercial provider of LQTS testing.

RESULTS
Our study of stakeholders identified five major themes and
several subthemes (see Supplementary Methods). Here, we
describe the three major themes and subthemes that are most
relevant to our study goal.
LQTS test provision in Canada before the settlement
Outsourcing of LQTS testing
Our analysis indicates that before the settlement the vast
majority of LQTS testing was not carried out in Canada. All
but one institution shipped patient samples out of the
country, mostly to laboratories run by LQTS gene patent
licensees in the United States, namely Transgenomic,15 who
were a party in the CHEO test case after it acquired the
patents, and GeneDx16,17 (see Supplementary Box 1).
Clinicians and directors expressed unanimous satisfaction
with these services. However, all but one (a clinician) stated
that United States–based testing is costly, citing between US
$3,000 and US$4,000 per test panel (the exact costs differed by
testing center due to bulk order negotiations).
Increasingly strained genetics budgets
Almost all directors (6 of 8) emphasized that laboratory
budgets are stretched and that the demand for molecular
testing is growing. Consequently, most provincial authorities
have chosen to centrally administer test outsourcing. How-
ever, the approval process for out-of-country applications is
generally resource-intensive. While directors and clinicians
affirmed that LQTS applications are almost always approved
because of the diagnostic’s proven clinical utility, directors
noted that this necessitates that other important requests be
refused.
Siloed budgets and health-care systems
Many interviewees (directors (5 of 8), clinicians (6 of 14) and
one developer) complained that the valuation of genetic
services in their respective provinces is poor and that
mechanisms to evaluate the clinical utility and overall
health-care
system
impact
of
molecular
testing
are
undeveloped.18 For example, clinical efficiencies resulting
from LQTS genetic testing, such as sparing asymptomatic
family members who test negative from ongoing follow-up,
are not channeled back to fund genetics programs. Several
directors (2 of 8) and developers (1 of 3) further noted that
provincial siloing of healthcare obviates collaboration and
efficiencies of scale.
Access to LQTS testing
Clinicians and directors reported that patient access to LQTS
testing before the settlement was generally very good.
However, a few (1 of 14 clinicians and 1 of 3 technology
developers) said that the application process may deter some
clinicians in “borderline” or less definitive clinical cases.
Others (1 of 14 clinicians and 1 of 8 directors) suggested that
beyond tertiary-care centers, knowledge of test availability
may be limited. One clinician said gaining approvals for those
beyond child-bearing age or without children sometimes
posed
challenges.
Another
said
colleagues
from
other
provinces had requested their assistance in accessing testing.

Consequently, in some circumstances patient access may
be
less
than
optimal
(see
Supplementary
S3
and
Supplementary Data). A few directors (2 of 8) predicted
that, similar to other repatriated tests, LQTS test volumes
would probably increase dramatically if local testing was
available.
Desire for local LQTS testing
Clear benefit to local testing
In line with the litigation commenced by CHEO, Canadian
interviewees almost unanimously supported the notion of
establishing local LQTS testing (23 of 24), describing clinical,
scientific,
ethical,
and
economic
advantages.
A
central
concern raised by outsourcing testing beyond Canada is a
resulting disconnect between patients’ genetic and clinical
information. Local testing would allow closer integration,
enabling more comprehensive test interpretation and opti-
mized patient care. Retaining genetic data locally, rather than
in foreign firms, would create local research opportunities.
Finally,
conducting
tests
in
Canada
would
retain
the
economic benefits of millions of dollars of testing business,
while building local genetics capacity. Many directors and
clinicians
emphasized
the
potential
logistical
ease
and
efficiency of local testing. One director voiced concerns about
privacy risks when patients’ genetic data are stored in foreign
jurisdictions. Two clinicians noted that test turn-around times
would be improved. However, almost all Canadian inter-
viewees (22 of 24) underscored the cost-effectiveness of local
testing. Several directors (3 of 8) and developers (2 of 3)
estimated that tests could be done locally for one-half to one-
quarter of the prices charged by commercial providers in the
United States. One clinician summarized this thought as
follows:
“There’s…something fundamentally wrong about having
to ship Canadian samples out of country to do testing that
Canada’s actually very capable of doing.”
Only one interviewee (a clinician) expressed concern about
repatriation.
They
wondered
whether
Canadian
public
laboratories could achieve the comprehensive test interpreta-
tion delivered by commercial providers, because some of the
latter draw on extensive private databases. However, all
directors outlined potential solutions, including: licensing
commercial databases; collaborating with current LQTS test
providers; drawing on public, but disparate locus-specific
LQTS databases; recovering patient data from test providers;
building their own databases using local samples; and
collaborating with local and regional cardiac genetics experts.
Several directors (3 of 8) and clinicians (2 of 14) noted that
federating genomic and anonymized phenotypic information
across provincial borders, subject to patient consent and
privacy protections, would be essential to build critical mass
and optimize local capacity.
Our research identified only one Canadian institution, in
Quebec, that carried out local LQTS testing before the
settlement. It has run Sanger-based testing for the five major
LQTS genes since 2008. It recently replaced this test with a
next-generation sequencing panel of 112 pan-cardiac genes,
including for LQTS.
The rising costs of outsourcing tests
According to directors (7 of 8) the cost of out-of-country
testing was becoming unmanageable. For example, in 2010
fewer than 15% of molecular tests ordered in Ontario were
performed in province.19 The rest were outsourced, mainly to
the
United
States,
at
a
cost
of
US$24
million
in
the 2013–14 fiscal year.20 Such figures prompted moves to
repatriate high-volume, high-cost tests, whose referrals were
increasing,21 including LQTS. A key enabler for local
implementation of multiplex tests is the increasing afford-
ability of next-generation sequencing technology. Directors
(7 of 8), clinicians (4 of 14) and developers (all 3) indicated
that, until recently, using commercial providers was the
practical choice for most Canadian stakeholders. However,
our analysis indicates that public laboratories across all
provinces in our study are now considering, or have already
attempted, repatriation of LQTS testing. Access to funding
has been a persistent barrier, but gene patents have also been a
key stumbling block.
Perverse incentives for local test implementation
The significant costs of working up new tests, including
validation, gaining laboratory accreditation, hiring staff and
purchasing capital equipment, are the purview of the public
institution wishing to implement the test. It must then pay for
each test performed. In contrast, tests that are sent out of the
country in Ontario, British Columbia and Quebec are paid for
directly by the province. Consequently, one director noted
that, in Ontario at least, there is a financial disincentive for
institutions to set up tests requiring significant work-up, such
as LQTS. In contrast, the Ontario repatriation initiative offers
an attractive alternative. Under this model, a single institution
or team of institutions is established as the provincial
reference laboratory for a particular test, and the ministry
pays for all tests performed. Test work-up costs, however, are
still borne by the institution.
Gene patents hinder repatriation
Around 2009, both Ontario and British Columbia sought to
repatriate LQTS testing. In Ontario, this involved inviting
hospitals to bid for the provincial testing contract.21 In British
Columbia, one institution had a test for the five major LQTS
genes ready for implementation. However, in early 2010 both
the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care
(MOHLTC) and the British Columbia institution received
warning letters from PGx Health, which wrongly identified
itself as the patentholder of one of the genes—(KCNQ1
(formally called KVLQT1)), which is now owned by PGx
Health’s successor firm, Transgenomic—advising them of the
recently issued Canadian patent. Interviewees said that,
subsequently, legal counsel for both provinces advised that
LQTS repatriation be dropped.

Shifting sands regarding policy on diagnostics patents
Provincial health authorities, institutions and public labora-
tories face a difficult choice. They can ignore gene patents and
risk litigation for infringement, or approach patent holders
and negotiate a license. However, such licenses can be costly.
Unlike commercial firms, which undertake an analysis of the
scope and validity of patents, hospitals do not have the budget
to do so. Directors (7 of 8) noted that institutions and
ministries are risk-adverse and have very limited funds to pay
for the use of patented diagnostics. Almost all directors (7 of
8) and clinicians (all 14) explicitly stated that patient care
ought to take priority over patents, but some noted that, in
practice, this is not always the case. Likewise, informants were
unanimous in questioning the patentability of naturally
occurring genes. One said:
“To be able to say that I can’t use my own brain to design
my very own test for testing a gene that is found in nature
is really quite ridiculous.”
Thus, perhaps unsurprisingly, several directors (5 of 8) and
one clinician stated that public sector laboratories in Canada
are currently infringing “all over the place,” although not
necessarily in relation to the LQTS patents.
Our research identified only one piece of official policy or
guidance from institutions or ministries on the management
of
gene
patents
(http://paceomics.org/index.php/quebec-
ministere-de-la-sante-et-des-services-sociaux-letter-to-quebec-
diagnostics-labs/). This was issued by the Québec Ministère de
la Santé et des Services Sociaux in 2008, after several public
laboratories received letters from Warnex Inc. claiming
exclusive rights to test for the V617f Jak2 mutation. The
letter demanded that testing be performed in Warnex’s
laboratory at premium prices. The ministry, finding no
evidence to support this claim—no patent had actually been
issued—adopted the official position that public laboratories
in Quebec continue Jak2 testing. One Quebec director stated
that their institution took this missive as applicable to
other genes.
Directors from other provinces reported various scenarios.
A few (2 of 8) noted that their institutions hold several gene
patents that yield significant revenues through licensing and
royalty fees. They said that the resulting conflict of interest
precluded an overarching institutional policy on gene patents.
Several (4 of 8) said that Canadian laboratories generally take
a “Don’t ask, don’t tell” approach,22 addressing intellectual
property on tests in a case-by-case manner. However, almost
all said that the lack of clarity, and of any open discussion
between institutions or with provincial health authorities,
leaves directors in an uncomfortable position. As a possible
testament to this, three did not respond to study invitations
and one was forbidden by their institution to participate in
this study.
Our analysis further indicates that government and institu-
tional decision-making processes relating to the LQTS gene
patents vary across provinces. Directors in Ontario and British
Columbia reported that their institutions and health authorities
were very concerned about the legal risk gene patents posed.
Others (2 of 8) said that, in the absence of more recent
guidance, they simply assumed that their institution’s approach
had not changed since provincial authorities defied the
demands of BRCA1 and 2 gene patent holder Myriad Genetics
in the 2000s.23 In Quebec, one developer stated that the LQTS
patents were deemed irrelevant to their institution’s decision to
implement testing because, as a public laboratory, they
performed these tests at cost.
Passing the “patent problem” to institutions
Ontario’s approach to gene patents has changed since 2010.
In 2013, the MOHLTC launched another repatriation drive
for LQTS. This time, it requested that institutions applying for
the provincial contract describe how the institution itself-
would address gene patents impinging on the test. One
director said:
“They basically decided that they would protect them-
selves, and not take a stance (on gene patents), and try to
turn all of the patent issues back on the hospital. So in the
application, it says that the Ministry has no involvement in
the patent issues. If you’re going to offer them, you have to
deal with them yourself.”
Ontario’s overall approach to repatriation garnered the
criticism of both Ontarian directors and three of its five
clinicians. It was said to be nontransparent and overly
competitive, disincentivizing collaboration between groups.
Further, it obligated individual institutions to conduct the
legally
specialized
task
of
identifying,
interpreting
and
navigating intellectual property law—tasks directors stated
they were not equipped or resourced to perform.24 With
repatriation processes ongoing, it was said that this piece-meal
and duplicative approach is particularly impractical.
A lack of unified policy short-circuits repatriation
The MOHLTC’s 2013 approach to repatriation has prolonged
the confusion over gene patents. Around December 2013, an
Ontario team was awarded the provincial contract for LQTS
testing. However, by October 2015, test development had still
not commenced because of continuing uncertainty about the
patents. Due to the high costs involved, both Ontario
directors said they would not work up the test until the
contract was confirmed. However, the contract crucially
depended on the cost of test provision, which depended on
whether licensing fees would be paid to the patent holders. In
their application, the Ontario team provided their own
estimate of licensing costs, as they hesitated to contact the
patentholders until they were certain that such official
acknowledgment of gene patents was the best approach.
However, if the licensing fee ended up being higher than what
the MOHLTC could afford to pay, the institution would not
be able to implement the test. Uncertainties about the
ownership and relevance of the many LQTS patents and
claims in existence added to the complexity. By March 2016,
this catch-22 was still not resolved. One director stated that

the process had been incredibly resource-intensive. In the
meantime, the province continued to outsource LQTS testing,
paying premium prices. Thus, lack of leadership by provincial
authorities stalled local testing, whereas an open, collaborative
approach may have sped up repatriation. In the words of one
director:
“If we had a provincial or even a national plan on how we
were going to behave as a group, that would have given us
an awful lot more backing and clarity on what we needed
to do, but that’s not what’s happened and now every
institution has its own plan and nobody tells anybody else.”
DISCUSSION
Legal25 and technological evolution, growing demand and
increasing fiscal pressure is pushing a sea-change in genetic
test provision in Canada20,21,26,27 and beyond.28 In this
context, our analysis demonstrates how gene patents slowed
institutional and provincial decision making, and blocked
repatriation of LQTS testing in the years preceding the 2016
CHEO agreement, and sets the stage for analysis of the likely
effects of that agreement. We found that the existence of
patents drew on funds that could have been better spent
elsewhere, and deprived local innovators, genetic service
providers, researchers, clinicians and patients of the oppor-
tunity to benefit from equitable, cost-effective testing, access
to data and associated research activities. While our study
focused on just one genetic disorder, gene patents have posed
ongoing uncertainties for imminent diagnostic technologies,29
and for continuing repatriation efforts.21
We found that the processes for establishing new tests vary
by province, revealing differential effects of gene patents. The
more centralized the decision-making process, the more
problems that patents presented. In Ontario and British
Columbia, institutions wishing to implement new tests must
register or license them with provincial authorities. During
these processes the LQTS patents raised the concern of
ministries, hindering repatriation. However, in provinces
where decisions about test implementation are made at the
level of the laboratory director or the hospital, patents were
less of a problem. Nevertheless, centralized processes are
important because they can allow monitoring and potentially
better assessment of health system impact, improved resource
allocation, and cost savings.26
Against this backdrop, we evaluate the potential effects of
the CHEO agreement. As a contractual agreement between
parties to the litigation, it does not, per se, alter Canadian law
or practice. Nevertheless, it offers the potential to serve as a
precedent for future agreements—one that can be required
though Canada’s Patent Act—but only if governments and
institutions develop the procedures and policies to do so.
Thus, Canada can continue to accept the higher costs and
lower access and innovation incumbent with the situation
described in this article, or choose to alter that landscape.
The agreement explicitly states that any nonprofit entity
providing services within Canada’s public health-care system
can freely obtain a license from Transgenomic to test for
LQTS-associated
genes.
Consequently,
any
hospital
or
laboratory can now provide the test. To our knowledge, at
least one Ontario hospital has done so thus far, representing a
major advance over the pre-agreement situation.
Beyond this, the agreement establishes a blueprint for
achieving similar access to any patented genetic test. Public
entities seeking to provide testing involving any patented gene
or method would first ask the relevant patentholders to sign
an analogous agreement to provide a no-cost license in
respect of those patents. If the patentholder refuses, then,
under section 19 of the Patent Act—which is similar in this
respect in most peer countries—the laboratory or hospital can
request the Canadian Commissioner of Patents to compel the
patentholder to sign.9,10 We anticipate that it is unlikely that
hospitals or laboratories will follow this procedure individu-
ally, given the expertise and resources required. Thus, for the
agreement to be effective, the provinces, which fund the
public health system, must take the lead, by providing
guidance and support in obtaining mandatory licenses
through the Commissioner of Patents.
Going forward, another critical concern for local providers
and the broader clinical genomics community is ensuring
rapid and accurate interpretation.21,30,31 Establishing high-
quality testing services involves two steps: (i) technical
processing of samples, and (ii) interpretation of the clinical
significance of identified variants. While the CHEO agree-
ment allows laboratories to freely determine the sequence of
patented genes, proper interpretation depends on consolidat-
ing information that is currently siloed across hundreds of
databases located in different public and private clinical
laboratories.32,33 Directors in this study underlined the need
to share data and build partnerships with stakeholders across
Canada and internationally to strengthen local capacity.
Initiatives to promote scientific openness, and to support
secure and ethically-compliant datasharing and interpretation
are gathering steam in Canada and beyond.30,33,34 While some
of the most comprehensive databases are held by commercial
providers who exploited their patent rights to amass private
collections,31 other commercial providers are strong advocates
of collaborative, open approaches.17
Our analysis also highlights redundancy across institutions
and provinces in assessing which tests should be locally
established,
and
in
implementation
processes.
This
was
exemplified by the lack of a coordinated response to gene
patents within and across provinces. In Ontario, institutions
were pitted against one another to win provincial test contracts,
each seeking to independently “reinvent the wheel.” At the very
least, leadership by provincial authorities should promote, rather
than obviate, shared solutions. A federally coordinated approach
would offer economies of scale for the purchase of services,
supplies, access to databases, analytical software, and so on.
Limitations
An important limitation of this study is the potential for bias
inherent in the small sample size and the sampling methods

used.
We endeavored to mitigate
this by seeking the
participation of all relevant laboratories, and by triangulating
interview data with publicly available information. We aimed
for comprehensive and up-to-date understanding of relevant
issues across institutions and provinces. However, in some
jurisdictions it was challenging to garner research participants,
and further, these systems are evolving (see Supplementary
Results and Limitations for details). Our data reflect the
context at the time of the interviews and recent follow-up
inquiries.
CONCLUSION
With respect to the provision of clinical genetic testing,
Canada is at an inflection point. Until now, law and practice
have limited the ability of Canadian hospitals, laboratories
and firms to innovate in this space, and they threaten future
provision of next-generation sequencing testing. The CHEO
agreement offers the potential to alter this landscape, but only
if governments are proactive in their support of public health-
care-system stakeholders.
Beyond proper implementation of the CHEO agreement,
continuing challenges include encouraging responsible shar-
ing of genetic and phenotypic data; coordinating physical
testing locations and interpretation expertise for particular
disorders across provinces and the country; and coordinating
assessments to guide adoption of novel and repatriated tests
to maximize access, clinical impact, and cost-effectiveness.
Other Canadian studies have called for inter-provincial
coordination to optimize the equity and efficiency of genetic
services.18,35 Our study underlines these calls for a national
conversation. More broadly, the number of gene-related
patents granted, at least in the United States, is increasing;4
thus, our study may be a harbinger of situations in other
jurisdictions. Further study is needed to ascertain the effect of
these patents on innovation and access, and to assess whether
employment of the CHEO agreement should be considered.
Finally,
open
discussion
and
collaboration
will
be
an
absolutely fundamental step towards maximizing the benefits
of genomic medicine not only for Canadians, but for all global
populations.

Gestational Diabetes and Poor Healthcare Affordability Among
Pregnant Women: A Double Whammy!
Riya Parikh, Yesoda Bhargava, Anupam Shukla
Indian Institute of Information Technology Pune, India
Abstract
The prevalence of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) is increasing at a rapid pace globally. This is concerning because GDM
can lead to serious health problems like Type 2 Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases, and Depression in both the mother and her baby.
GDM also increases healthcare expenditure during and after pregnancy and this is particularly worrisome for women belonging to
households with poor healthcare affordability. Given the rising prevalence of GDM and its adverse impact, it is crucial to identify its
risk factors and explore the factors associated with healthcare affordability among pregnant women. Our work attempts to identify
the association between lifestyle (exercise, fruit, and vegetable consumption), sociodemographic factors, and Gestational Diabetes.
Second, attempts to investigate the determinants of Health care affordability among pregnant women. Multivariate stepwise logistic
regression is used for investigation purposes. We found Depression, higher BMI, and lower fruit intake to be associated with higher
odds of GDM among pregnant women. Whereas the presence of GDM, lower socioeconomic position, absence of health insurance,
and single motherhood were found to be associated with poor healthcare affordability. Lifestyle and mental health are associated
with the GDM risk in pregnant women. Marital status, health insurance, and socioeconomic position are associated with healthcare
affordability among pregnant women. The study can aid in better health outcomes for pregnant women and the creation of inclusive
health policies.

increases the risk of pre-eclampsia, shoulder dystocia [2], macrosomia [2, 9], and neonatal hypoglycaemia [2]. More-
over, babies born to women with GDM have a higher risk of insulin insensitivity [1] or T2D [4, 6, 10], Hypertension
[4], metabolic syndrome [4], and obesity [1, 6, 10] in adulthood. Therefore, there is a need to study the risk factors of
GDM for the safety and long-term health of both the mother and the child.
Existing research on GDM has identified obesity [2, 4, 7, 11], sedentary lifestyle [4, 11], excessive weight gain
during pregnancy [4, 11], higher pregnancy age [2, 4, 11] and minority ethnicity lineage (Black and Hispanic) [3, 5, 12]
as its key risk factors. These studies have advanced our understanding related to the primary prevention of GDM risk.
However, health care affordability (HCA) among pregnant women suffering from GDM remains under-explored.
Given the increase in health care expenditure globally [13] and the seriousness of GDM among pregnant women, it is
crucial to explore the poor HCA factors among them.
Fundamentally, our research makes two main contributions to the field of GDM and public health care affordability,
with the following objectives. First, we explore the association between lifestyle, socio-demographic factors and GDM
risk. Second, we identified the factors associated with poor health care affordability among pregnant women. Previous
research on the topic have focused on GDM risk and barriers to health care access.
Our study is the first to evaluate healthcare affordability and GDM in a given population. Our work could be used
to improve the outcome of pregnant women with GDM with poor health care affordability, and also help governments
and healthcare providers make better inclusive health policies.
The rest of the paper is organised as follows: First a literature review, Second the Methodology, followed by the
Results and Discussion and Fourth the Conclusion section.
2. Literature Review
Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a condition of hyperglycemia or sugar intolerance in women during
pregnancy [14, 15]. GDM is a concern for public health globally because the prevalence of GDM is increasing
[1, 16, 17, 18] with current rates of 1% to 18% [5, 12]. In the United States in the year 2016, the overall prevalence of
GDM was 6% [19] which is alarming given the ailment.
GDM can increase the risk of poor birth outcomes for pregnant women and hurt the infant’s health [18]. It predis-
poses the mother and infant to comorbidities of type 2 diabetes [4, 5, 6, 10], cardiovascular diseases[1, 2, 5], depression
[1] and infants to macrosomia [2] and obesity in adulthood [1, 6, 10]. Therefore, it is critical to understand the risk
factors associated with GDM in pregnant women. This will potentially help in the early diagnosis of the disease and
guide timely care to prevent further health complications in the mother and the child.
Research on GDM has identified factors like history of GDM [5, 11], impaired glucose tolerance [5], genetics
[5, 11], high BMI [5], overweight or obese [11], sedentary lifestyle [4, 11], poor diet [4], advanced age ( =35 years)
[11], poor mental health and depression [20] as risk factors. Some studies [1, 21] investigated demographic factors
like age, educational level, ethnicity, and family history of diabetes.
A cross-sectional study [12] found Black and Hispanic women to have a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes
after GDM compared to White women. But, a study [16] on a cohort of women with uniform screening, diagnosis and
equal medical health access, argued for heterogeneity of GDM prevalence within these subgroups based on place of
birth (migration status). Suggesting that GDM risk is associated with both genetic makeup and socio-environmental
factors. Shepherd et al. [4] found that exercise and diet intervention were associated with reduced GDM development.
Thus demographic and lifestyle factors also play an important role in determining GDM risk.
Traditional diabetes risk factors such as genetics, BMI, diet etc. cannot fully explain the GDM risk, which is
strongly correlated to social determinants and different clinical access [12]. That being said, GDM is not extensively
explored as compared to diabetes, despite being inflicting both millennial mothers and future generations.
The extremely vital step to reducing the ailment of pregnant women is the ability to afford the cure, be it lifestyle
changes or medication. It is been found that GDM medication being expensive was strongly associated with poor
adherence to medical treatment [5]. Moreover, basic prenatal care puts women at a financial disadvantage [22] and
make them less affordable. Making affordable prenatal care a very important aspect of equal health care affordability
and more so for women suffering from GDM.

Evidence has highlighted the absence of suboptimal GDM care because of limited healthcare access [5], financial
constraints [5], poor postpartum care and irregular postnatal follow-ups [17], discordant perception of GDM among
healthcare professionals and patients [5]. Women belonging to economically weaker sections and ethnicities of Black
and Hispanic faced a higher risk of perinatal and poor health outcomes [17]. Few Hispanic women reported being
screened for diabetes, few had health insurance and access to routine health care as compared to White [12].
Unaffordable health care may lead to adverse delivery outcomes and poor health outcomes for mother and fetus
later in life. For GDM patients, health care access has been explored but healthcare affordability is under-explored
[23]. Hence, studying health care affordability among pregnant women and its determinants is vital.
Most of the earlier studies have focused on identifying risk factors for gestational diabetes or the barriers to health
care access faced by pregnant women with gestational diabetes separately. But to our knowledge, no study has ex-
plored healthcare affordability and GDM, that to both in a given population. To make more informed health policy
decisions and lifestyle-relevant interventions, it is vital to explore both in a particular population of GDM women.
That being said, the objective of this study is to Identify the lifestyle, and sociodemographic risk factors associated
with Gestational diabetes and explore the determinants of poor health care affordability among pregnant women in
the United States.
3. Methodology
3.1. Study Design
Our study is a cross-sectional data analysis, and in the following sections, we describe it in detail. We also explain
our method of data preparation, variable selection and the model creation for the analysis.

3.2. Data Source
For the study, data were used from the Behavioural Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) [24], Centres for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), USA. The dataset from BRFSS is an equal representation and cross-sectional
survey, which is conducted annually by the CDC, the main component of the United States Department of Health.
Dataset for Model I BRFSS data of the years 2011, 2012, 2013, 2015, 2017, and 2019 was needed and for Model
II that of the years 2011 to 2020. These years contained the variables required for respective models.
3.3. Data Preparation
Records with non-missing values for all the required variables were included. Women with the pregnant status
“Yes” were selected for the study. Records with BMI values in the range [15 to 50] were selected because this en-
compassed 95% BMI distribution. The removal of outliers from the datasets based on the fruit score and vegetable
score was performed. The unreasonably high serving records (≥20 portions per day) for both fruit and vegetable were
considered outliers and thus, removed from the dataset. The final variables set and their description are shown in Table

3.4. Variable Description and Modelling Approach
3.4.1. Model I
Independent Variables: The demographic measure (Age [2, 4, 11], Ethnicity [1, 5]) and lifestyle measure (Exercise
[4, 11], BMI [1, 2, 4, 11], Diet [4], Mental Health (MH) [1]) were chosen as independent variables based on the prior
evidence of their association with GDM risk. To streamline the analysis of MH with GDM, categories were created
as shown in Table 2 (categorization is based on DSM - V [25]). A detailed explanation and process of the creation of
fruit score, vegetable score, and mental health categories can be found in appendix [26].
For Model I, two interaction terms were explored:
1. Mental Health categories × Ethnicity
2. Age × BMI
And Table 3 summarises all the parameters and interaction terms used in Model I.

Dependent Variable: The response to the question “(Ever told) you have diabetes?” was used to create the GDM
variable. GDM was assigned ’1’ if the respondent had diabetes, pre-diabetes, or gestational diabetes and a value of ’0’
otherwise. Pre-existing diabetes, GDM, and pre-diabetes were considered cases indicative of GDM. By definition, all
these subgroups have hypercalcemia during pregnancy [4] and thus can be regarded as GDM cases.
Data Modelling Approach: For Model I, the outcome variable of GDM is binary hence, binomial stepwise logistics
regression was employed to explore. After obtaining the coefficients, odds ratios were computed. The equation of
model I is explained in Table 3. Every step of Model I is explained in detail in appendix [26].
3.4.2. Model II
Independent Variables: Lifestyle, demographic measures, Health insurance [27], marital status [28], Socioeco-
nomic position (SEP) [27], and metropolitan status [27] were used for exploring their association with health care
affordability. Based on prior evidence, income [29, 30] and education [30, 31] were used to compute SEP as shown
in Equation 1. In this study, a higher value of SEP reflects a better socio-economic position. The detailed explanation
and process of the creation can be found in appendix [26].
Socioeconomic Position (SEP) = Income + Education Level
(1)
For Model II following interaction terms were explored:
1. Gestational diabetes status × Ethnicity
2. Gestational diabetes status × Socioeconomic Position
Dependent Variable: The response to the question “Was there a time in the past 12 months when you needed to
see a doctor but could not because of cost?” was used to create the poor health care affordability indicator. It was
assigned ’1’ if the respondent was not able to afford the health care and ’0’ otherwise. The variable for the study and
the interaction term considered for Model II are summarised in Table 3.
Data Modelling Approach: The outcome variable here is also binary (health care affordability), thus binomial
multivariate stepwise logistic regression was used. Model II is explained and represented in the equation in Table 3
and a detailed explanation can be found in appendix [26].
R studio version 4.0.3 was used to perform the analysis.
4. Results and Discussion
In this section we present our preliminary results, descriptive summary and final results model-wise. We explore the
risk of GDM and study the poor health care affordability among pregnant women. We also discuss the implications
of our results for clinical interventions and health care programs, particularly for pregnant women. Moreover, we
compare our work to previous research and explain how it advances the field. We also discuss the limitations of our
study and guide for future research on the topic to fill the gaps in the conclusion section.
4.1. Preliminary Results
The total records collated for Model I and Model II were N = 2,783,667 and N = 4,574,028 respectively. After data
preparation and cleaning 10,973 and 6,600 records remained for Model I and Model II respectively. The descriptive
summary of variables in the dataset for both models is shown in Table 4.

4.2. Descriptive Summary of the Data
4.2.1. Descriptive Data Summary of Model I
6.19% (N=679) of pregnant women were found to have gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in the dataset. The
mean age of women in the dataset was 33.73 years [95% CI (33.63 - 33.84)], indicating several women had advanced
age during pregnancy. The mean BMI of women in the dataset was found to be 26.99 [95% CI (26.88 - 27.10) with
a median of 26.06 [95% CI (25.77 - 26.27)] highlighting a normal BMI [32] for pregnant women in the sample. The
prevalence of GDM varied with ethnicity: White (5.36%, N=390), Black (7.10%, N=69), Hispanic (8.67%, N=140),
Other race (8.01%, N=64), and multiracial (5.21%, N=16).
The prevalence of GDM among women who reported performing exercise was 5.73% (N = 466) as compared to
7.54% (N = 213) among those who reported no exercise [difference in proportion: 11.00%, 95% CI (6.25% - 15.72%),
p < 0.001]. This highlights that sedentary behaviour may be associated with higher GDM risk.
The average fruit and vegetable consumption among pregnant women were 1.43 [95% CI (1.40 - 1.45)] units per
day and 0.95 [95% CI (0.93 - 0.96)] units per day respectively, which is lower than the recommendation for five units
of consumption of fruits and vegetables by the World Health Organisation (WHO) for a healthy diet [33]. The GDM
prevalence (5.67%, 6.56%, 10.08%) varied among women with different depression levels (Low, Moderate, Severe),
indicating poor mental health is associated with a higher risk of GDM.
4.2.2. Descriptive Data Summary of Model II
Poor healthcare affordability was observed among 11.74% (N =775) of pregnant women in the dataset. Among
pregnant women belonging to Black ethnicity, it was 17.47% (N = 119) and for Hispanic ethnicity, it was 22.96% (N
= 160), whereas for White ethnicity it was 9.52% (N =437). This indicates a higher prevalence of poor healthcare
affordability among pregnant women belonging to the minority ethnic group.
A higher proportion of pregnant women suffering from GDM (19.39%, N = 89) were not able to afford health care
compared to (11.17%, N = 686) of women without GDM [difference in proportion: 8.22%, 95% CI (4.44% - 12.00%),
p < 0.001]. This indicates that in the current dataset, pregnant women with GDM were more likely to have financial
disadvantages and in turn poor healthcare affordability. Thus, Pregnant women with GDM need additional support
both morally and financially to cover counselling, tests, and intervention costs [34].

Parikh et al. / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2024) 000–000
Poor health care affordability was 20.99% (N = 93) among pregnant women with “separated” marital status and
20.10% (N = 277) among “never-married” pregnant women compared to 8.47% (N = 405) among “married pregnant”
women [difference in proportion: 12.52%, 95% CI ( 8.57 - 16.47 ) (separated), 8.00%, 95% CI ( 5.84 - 10.15 ) (never
married), p < 0.001]. This indicates that pregnant women who are not married are more likely to report poor healthcare
affordability than their married counterparts. Poor healthcare affordability was almost similar among pregnant women
living in metropolitan (11.24%, N = 412) and non-metropolitan areas (10.86%, N = 178). This indicates no difference
in poor health care affordability for metropolitan or nonmetropolitan areas in the dataset.
Among women with no health insurance, 36.77% (N = 189) reported poor health care affordability as compared
to 9.63% (N = 586) having health insurance [difference in proportion: 27.14%, 95% CI (22.82 - 31.46), p < 0.001].
This indicates women without health insurance were more likely to report poor healthcare affordability. The mean
socioeconomic position (SEP) of respondents reporting poor health care affordability was 8.84 [95% CI (8.64 - 9.03)]
as compared to those not reporting 11.47 [95% CI (11.40 - 11.54)]. This indicates that poor healthcare affordability
was more likely for women from lower socioeconomic backgrounds.
4.3. Final Results
4.3.1. Results of Model I:
No statistically significant relationship was found between the age of pregnant women and GDM risk in the given
dataset (OR 0.98, p = 0.895). BMI (OR 1.053, p < 0.001) was found to be marginally statistically significant with
GDM odds, and this association was found to be modified by age of the pregnant women [(0.05 + 0.01 Age) × BMI].
Our findings are refining association of advanced age [1, 11, 21] and high BMI [5, 11] which previous studies have
reported as independent risk factors of GDM.
Pregnant women of Hispanic (OR 1.654, p < 0.001) and other races (OR 1.460, p < 0.01) descents were found to
be at a higher risk of GDM. Compared to pregnant women of White ethnicity, the odds of GDM for pregnant women
of Hispanic descent are higher. However, no statistically significant association was found for Black (OR 1.04, p =
0.787) and Multi-racial (OR 0.89, p < 0.05) pregnant women. The finding is in line for Hispanic ethnicity, however,
we did not find any association with Black ethnicity which previous research has found [1, 21].
The portions of fruit consumed in a day were also found significantly associated with GDM risk. Thus, a unit
increase in the portions of fruit consumption per day was found to be associated with lower odds of GDM by 7.89%
(OR 0.920, p < 0.05). However, no significant association was found between vegetable consumption and GDM.
Previous research explored poor diet [4] which is very broad, we focused our analysis on specifically explore the
association of fruit and vegetable consumption with GDM.
The association of Exercise with GDM was not found significant. Our finding is different from the previous research
which identified sedentary lifestyle [4, 11] as risk factor of GDM.
Moreover, the odds of GDM risk were more among women with severe depression (OR 1.654, p < 0.001) com-
pared to lower depression levels. This indicates a 65.37% higher odds of GDM among women with severe depression
levels as compared to those with a low depression level. An overview of the results of Model I are tabulated in Table 5.
This is in line with previous research which identified poor mental health and depression [20] as risk factors of GDM.
We believe our findings could help improve the rate of early GDM identification during the prenatal stage, given
the factors identified by our study are incorporated when suggesting tests for GDM to pregnant women.
4.3.2. Results of Model II:
The ethnicity of pregnant women was not found to be significant in association with poor healthcare affordability.
Previous research have found poor health care access for women of Black and Hispanic ethnicity [17, 12].
In the dataset, women reporting GDM (OR 1.467, p < 0.05) indicated poor healthcare affordability. Women with
GDM were found to have 46.74% higher odds of poor healthcare affordability as compared to those without GDM.
This is in line with previous research which found that despite having health insurance face difficulty accessing
speciality health care critical for women with GDM [35].
The socio-economic position (OR 0.793, p < 0.001) of pregnant women was negatively associated with health care
affordability, indicating that a unit increase in SEP was associated with lower odds of poor health care affordability by
20.70%. Previous research has also identified the absence of adequate health care due reported by women belonging
to lower socio-economic positions and having financial limitations[5, 17, 35]

The absence of health insurance (OR 0.341, p < 0.001) was a significant determinant of poor healthcare affordabil-
ity among pregnant women. Pregnant women without health insurance have 65.88% higher odds of poor health care
affordability than pregnant women having health insurance. Previous studies have confirmed the negative correlation
between the absence of health insurance with the ability to access health care [35, 36].
The marital status of pregnant women was a significant determinant of poor healthcare affordability. Pregnant
women who never married were found to have 174.1% higher odds of poor health care affordability than married
women (OR 2.74, p < 0.05). A study also found marital status as the factor of maternal care utilisation [36].
Location status (Metropolitan or Non-Metropolitan) was not found significant with poor healthcare affordability.
However, Previous studies have found the distance to nearest facilities as a significant factor [36]. The results of Model
II are presented in Table 5.
We hope the findings of our research help the policymakers and health care providers to frame policies with the
inclusion of the above factors to provide better coverage of health care for pregnant women.

5. Conclusion
To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study that explores the risk factors of gestational diabetes and healthcare
affordability among pregnant women in the same population.
We conclude from results of Model I, that poor mental health is a significant risk factor for GDM. We also found
that a higher BMI at an advanced age and lower daily consumption of fruit are associated with an increased risk of
GDM. Furthermore, no significant association between exercise and GDM was found. However, a study [4] found
that exercise and diet intervention were associated with reduced GDM development. Perhaps the association was not
found significant due to similar exercise patterns among pregnant women respondents. With Model I we also conclude
that women belonging to Hispanic Ethnicity were found to have higher odds of GDM than that of White ethnicity.
This is in line with a cross-sectional study [12] that found Hispanic women to have a higher risk of developing type 2
diabetes after GDM compared to White women.
We conclude from results of Model II, that socioeconomic position and health insurance are significantly associated
with poor healthcare affordability. Our observation is also supported by a study [17] that reported women belonging
to economically disadvantaged sections faced higher odds of insubstantial prenatal care and poor health outcomes.
Moreover, with Model II we conclude that among pregnant women, those unmarried and those having GDM, have
higher odds of poor healthcare affordability. This is true of the evidence of poor medical treatment adherence due to
the absence of affordable GDM medication among pregnant women with GDM.
A causal link could not be established between Age, BMI, dietary intake, ethnicity, exercise, and GDM because
our study is a cross-sectional data analysis. Perhaps, longitudinal studies could be more useful in this regard. To
reinforce health care affordability’s causal association with SEP, health insurance, metropolitan status, and GDM
status more cross-sectional data analysis studies are needed to be performed. Nevertheless, the findings suggest the
need to introduce subsidised healthcare programs and interventions which consider the pregnant women’s marital
status, socioeconomic background, and health insurance and ensure proper healthcare facilities during pregnancy.

“Gluing” together integrated Geriatric Clinical Service lines (GCSL) within the
US healthcare system is a signiﬁcant challenge. Reasons encompass health pro-
fessional workforce shortages, inconsistent requirements for geriatric educa-
tional competencies among the health professional disciplines, preconceived
ageist attitudes about older adults with complex illnesses, and a US healthcare
system infrastructure that is not aligned with longitudinal and interdisciplin-
ary care needs for older adults. This review focuses on three major characteris-
tics of the US healthcare system that have impeded widespread dissemination
of GCSLs: 1) the US’s historical fee for service (FFS) reimbursement system; 2)
increasing reliance upon disease speciﬁc specialty care services for older
patients that have resulted from advances in medicine; and 3) rising consolida-
tion of US healthcare systems over the last 30 years. Three speciﬁc options are
also provided that might help change the current and future trajectories of
GCSLs: 1) local political advocacy to implement health policy legislation; 2)
expand geriatric physician and health professional workforce by nontradi-
tional means; and 3) reprioritize expansionist healthcare systems corporate
behavior. Each of these interventions will be hard to achieve, but it is time to
unite if GCSLs are to thrive as pathways to improve care outcomes for older
adults with complex medical, cognitive and neuropsychiatric disorders. (Am J

INTRODUCTION
S
ince 2008, four Institute of Medicine (IOM), now
called
the
National
Academy
of
Medicine
(NAM) reports have dealt with the state of geriatric
care in the United State (US). The 2008 report summa-
rized the then current geriatric workforce in the US
and laid forth recommendations necessary to build
the geriatric workforce to meet future needs of an
aging US populations.1 Four years later, the IOM
issued a report speciﬁc to the geriatric mental health
and substance use challenges for older adults, that
was followed 3 years later by the release of a report
on cognitive aging and dementia.2,3 This past year
NAM released the proceedings of a workshop that
again focused on the rising mental health needs of
our aging society.4 In 2015, the American Geriatrics
Society (AGS) issued a report commissioned by the
SCAN Foundation deﬁning patient-centered care for
older adults with complex healthcare needs that
described necessary care elements to achieve high
quality outcomes.5 In 2018 the John A. Hartford Foun-
dation and the Institute for Healthcare Improvement
partnered
together
to
launch
the
“Age-Friendly
Health System Imperative” that created a framework
for quality geriatric care called the “4Ms: 1) knowing
and acting upon what “Matters” to an older patient;
and implementing important geriatric care principles
regarding
2)
medications;
3)
mobility;
and
4)
mentation.6,7 Last intersectionality of ageism with the
burdens of major late-life neuropsychiatric disorders
was further addressed by a 2022 comprehensive
review published in World Psychiatry that under-
scored how positive aspects of aging, for example,
resilience, wisdom, and prosocial behavior, should be
part of patient focused and family-centered multidis-
ciplinary team based care.8
Common themes were found in each report. Geri-
atric clinical services for frail older adults with com-
plex
physical,
cognitive
and
neuropsychiatric
conditions should be provided by multidisciplinary
teams; bridge general and mental healthcare sectors;
be delivered seamlessly across healthcare settings; be
longitudinally focused; and organized in a manner
that measures health status outcomes inclusive of
functional independence and quality of life. We
believe geriatric clinical service lines (GCSLs) repre-
sent the best organizational framework to implement
the care pathways described above. Within academic
settings GCSLs are ideal settings to expand geriatric
competencies among all gerontological and under-
graduate and graduate health professional disci-
plines, and develop, test, and disseminate practical
assessment tools to help screen for incident conditions
in late-life such as frailty-risk assessment, cognitive
impairment and psychiatric disorders.
The above reports also included speciﬁc healthcare
policy recommendations such as: requiring licensure
and certiﬁcation agencies to set performance stand-
ards for practitioners that demonstrate some level of
proﬁciency geriatric competencies; supporting public
and private payer ﬁnancial incentives to enhance
recruitment and retention of geriatric health profes-
sionals; promoting payment enhancements for evi-
dence based integrated/collaborative models of care;
and funding research that tests the effectiveness and
dissemination of novel clinical service delivery pro-
grams.1−6
The 2023 NAM report summarized how Federal
agencies have responded to program development
and
ﬁnancing
recommendations.4
The
Substance
Abuse and Mental Health Services Agency (SAM-
SHA) and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Serv-
ices (CMS) invested in novel models of care and
Medicare payment mechanisms. For example, SAM-
SHA’s Certiﬁed Community Behavioral Health Clin-
ics are required to deliver a comprehensive suite of
behavioral health and substance use screening and
care delivery services, based on community needs
assessment, that must span the entire the age spec-
trum. The 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable
Care Act (PPACA) enabled CMS to expand payment
reforms for mental health services, such as “incident”
billing, collaborative care management codes, and
expanded the eligibility of different behavioral health
providers to receive payment for services.4 Addition-
ally, PPACA supported value-based delivery care
redesign by directing the CMS’s Center for Innova-
tions to support testing the effectiveness of new mod-
els of care such as the Guiding an Improved
Dementia Experience Program (GUIDE) and the Bun-
dle Payments for Care Improvement Advance (BPCI
Advance) models.9,10
The NAM reports, reinforced other commentaries,
point out how the multidisciplinary geriatric health
professional workforce has not kept paced with
expansion and increased clinical service demand for

the 65+ population.1−4,11−17 For geriatricians and geri-
atric psychiatrists this gap is widening. Using 1992
ABMS Certiﬁcation data there were 5,926 board certi-
ﬁed geriatricians and 849 geriatric psychiatrists corre-
sponding to a 1990 census 65+ population based ratio
of 18.9 per 100,000 for geriatricians, and 2.7/100,000
for
geriatric
psychiatrists.18
Using
2023
ABMS
Certiﬁcation data and the 2020 census 65+ population
estimates, there were 6,906 board certiﬁed geriatri-
cians or 11.9/100,000, and 1,551 geriatric psychiatrists
or 2.8/100,000.19 Further, 2023 ABMS data found
rural states greatly underserved, and 62% of geriatri-
cians and 65% of geriatric psychiatrists resided in just
twelve states (California, Washington, Texas, Michi-
gan, Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, Pennsyl-
vania,
Maryland,
Virginia,
North
Carolina,
and
Florida).19 The physician geriatric fellowship pipeline
in academic year 2023−2024 was anemic with only
317 geriatric medicine fellows (Internal Medicine/
Family Medicine) and 61 geriatric psychiatry fellows
in active training, down from 363 and 100, respec-
tively in the academic year 2001−2002.20
Dr. Jerry Gurwitz’s refers to this as the “paradoxi-
cal decline” in geriatric medicine as a profession, and
offers a number of veriﬁable explanations such as:
personal compensation; attitudes of trainees towards
working with frail older adults; and lack of geriatric
education curricular time in undergraduate and grad-
uate medical education.21 Similar assertions have
been made for geriatric psychiatry, and are further
nuanced by evidence showing about 53% of the US
geriatric psychiatry workforce is represented by
international medical graduates (IMGs); a trend that
has been evident for over 20 years.16,22 Calls for
urgent action with speciﬁc recommendations are jus-
tiﬁably resolute, including mini-fellowships in the
last year of primary residency training.23,24
In our opinion, operationalizing and widespread
dissemination of GCSLs would be a best practice
solution to the challenges of caring for complex older
patients. But accomplishing such within the US
healthcare system has been like sailing against gale
force headwinds. We describe three US healthcare
system characteristics that have fueled these head-
winds: 1) the US’s historical fee for service (FFS) reim-
bursement
system;
2)
increasing
reliance
upon
disease speciﬁc specialty care services for older
patients; and 3) rising consolidation and growth
mindset of hospital/healthcare systems in the US.
This review will offer three options to address these
challenges.
The oxygen that fuels these operational challenges
is money. More speciﬁcally, how our FFS ﬁnancial
incentives support disease speciﬁc and procedural
based specialty care; disincentivizes multidisciplinary
team based care; and creates conditions that incentiv-
ize healthcare systems to invest in proﬁtable clinical
services lines that justify and support hospital/
healthcare system consolidation and growth mind-
set.25−31 One may question the oversimpliﬁcation that
ﬁnances play an outsize role in limiting GCSLs dis-
semination, but we counter with this—if positive
ﬁnancial margins are not key decision and policy
drivers, why has private equity invested in multispe-
cialty physician practices, hospitals/healthcare sys-
tems, and long-term care settings in recent years?32−35
It’s not to lose money!
FEE FOR SERVICE REIMBURSEMENT FOR
HEALTHCARE SERVICES
Financing longitudinal and integrated healthcare
services for an aging population in the United States
(US) has been a health policy challenge for years.
Financial reform of Medicare began in the 1980s
when
hospital
cost-based
reimbursement
was
replaced by payments based upon medical severity
diagnostic related groups (DRGs), and physician pay-
ments became tied to the resource based relative
value scale (RBRVS).36 Both reforms were anchored
by “episodes” of care, e.g., hospital admissions or
physician service visits. The Tax Equity and Fiscal
Accountability Act of 1982 (TEFRA) stimulated the
emergence of Medicare HMO’s in the US.37 By the
late 1990s and early 2000s ﬁnancial and structural
challenges in Medicare fee-for-service and manage
care programs contributed to fragmented care and
out-right underfunding of necessary services for older
adults with psychiatric disorders because mental
health beneﬁt parity had not been achieved.38,39 To
better understand incentives of fee-for-service reim-
bursement, we recommend readers to review Beren-
son and Emanuel’s “Viewpoint” in JAMA that
provoked ﬁerce and contentious editorial comments
from physicians representing various sectors of the
physician community.40−46

Healthcare systems and providers must rely on
private insurers, procedures and technical services to
ensure their ﬁnancial solvency because these pay-
ments are higher than Medicare or Medicaid rates,
but
private
reimbursement
rates
are
generally
“shrouded in secrecy.”47−49 From a ﬁnancial perspec-
tive GCSLs may not achieve positive operational mar-
gins because of their reliance on Medicare payments;
their emphasis on multidisciplinary care necessary to
manage complex frail geriatric patients; and lower
utilization of procedural or technological services that
generate higher operational income (Table 1). Their
ﬁnancial performance is challenging for hospital/
healthcare executives, especially when a hospital/
healthcare system’s total operational income for their
clinical enterprise is either “breakeven” or negative. It
is understandable how reliance upon high margin
clinical service lines (e.g., cardiology, oncology, etc.)
are top of mind for these executives in order to main-
tain their system’s ﬁnancial health. It’s also important
to know that calculating actual operational costs and
margins associated with a speciﬁc DRGs is extremely
challenging because of how
ﬁxed and variable
expenses are apportioned to a service line.50
Hopefully, the 2010 PPACA’s deployment of
value-based payment models, such as GUIDE or

Characteristics of the US Healthcare System That Impede the “Gluing” Together of Geriatric Clinical Service Lines
(GCSLs)
Characteristics
Reasons
Fee for Service Reimbursement
 Reimbursement to health providers is based upon episodes of care for Medicare, Medicaid and
private insurers.
○Inpatient Prospective Payment System for Medicare
○Contractual episode reimbursement between hospitals/healthcare systems for private insurers
○Fee-for-Service CPT codes for outpatient/ambulatory care services
 New inpatient “value-based” payment models may improve efﬁciencies and quality of care.
○New chronic care management CPT codes and telemedicine/telepsychiatry services.
○CMS’s Bundle Payments for Care Improvement Advance (BPCI Advance) models and Dementia
Care Programs “GUIDE.”
& Current demonstration projects currently focus on disease speciﬁc and episodes of care (say
hip replacement or heart failure)
& No GCSL projects to date.
Specialty Care Emphasis in Medicine
 Patient-physician trust fundamental to building of an effective therapeutic relationship;
○Requires “time” that is in short supply given the current pace of clinical practice
 Geriatric specialists (medicine and psychiatry) chose to concentrate on the care and management
of medically complex older patients.
 Specialists in other adult medical disciplines focus on disease speciﬁc treatments.
○Full understanding of the patient’s functional capacity, economic, or biopsychosocial
determinants of health may be lacking
○Service delivery may require frequent follow-up visits that could contribute to low value, high
volume clinical outcomes.
○From the patient’s and family’s perspective, a large amounts of their time is spent navigating
“doctor” appointments.
US Healthcare System Consolidation
 The scale of the US healthcare system consolidation is sizable.
○2023—about 67% of US hospitals were system afﬁliated, corresponding to about 76% of all
hospital beds
○Between 2010 and 2016 hospital owned primary care physician practices grew from 28% to 44%
○2018—more that 35% of all physicians worked in practices fully or partly owned by a hospital.
○2020—70% of the Medicare Advantage plans were controlled by four insurers by 2020.
 Outcomes of healthcare consolidation have been mixed.
○Initial consolidation efforts achieved efﬁciencies in non-concentrated markets.
○As markets become more concentrated, consolidation:
& Reduced competition
& Increased healthcare system market power leading to higher prices and reduced quality
& Created incentives to engage in anticompetitive behavior to preserve market dominance.
○Healthcare system “Growth mentality”
& Strong among healthcare systems executives and boards of directors
& Financially beneﬁcial for healthcare system executives
○Healthcare systems sustain ﬁnancial performance:
& Through clinical service lines that generate high operational income and operational margins
& GCSLs do not generate high operational margins.

BPCI Advance model programs, will reorient our
payment system away from episodic fee-for-service
care models toward efﬁciency, integration/continuity
of care, and health outcomes driven model. To date
CMS’s BPCI Advance models, however, remain
dependent upon an incident evident (e.g., hip frac-
ture) as oppose to longitudinal care for managing
older patients experiencing signiﬁcant complex medi-
cal comorbidities. Similar to the GUIDE program, we
hope CMS will issue an RFP that speciﬁcally tests the
overall effectiveness for GCSLs for complex frail older
patients, inclusive of those with late-life neuropsychi-
atric disorders, that would aligned with existing pol-
icy recommendations and practice guidelines2,4,5,8,51
From the perspective of geriatric medicine and psy-
chiatry we believe these payment mechanisms will
enable GCSLs to reach their full potential that could
lead to wider dissemination by US hospital/health-
care systems.
SPECIALTY CARE EMPHASIS IN
MEDICINE
In policy discussions we often forget about the
interpersonal dynamic between patient, physician
and the healthcare team at the “point-of-care.” Trust
is the interpersonal currency necessary for effective
communication, and more importantly, it is funda-
mental to building an effective therapeutic patient-
physician relationship (Table 1). Building patient-
physician trust requires time, communication, conti-
nuity and predictability; often in short supply given
the current pace of clinical practice in both ambula-
tory and hospital settings. Continuity and coordina-
tion of care “glue” together the suite of GCSL services
that promote functional, cognitive and psychiatric
functioning.
Geriatricians and geriatric psychiatrists are drawn
toward this type of clinical service provision. Con-
versely, specialists in other adult medical disciplines,
who in good faith, focus on disease speciﬁc treat-
ments for patients, may not have a full understanding
of the patient’s functional capacity, economic, or bio-
psychosocial determinants of health; nor comprehend
the entirety of the patient’s lived experience. Patients
and
families
spend
large
amounts
of
their
time
navigating a perplexing array of “doctor” appointments.
How often have we heard families describe difﬁculty
discerning which provider to contact regarding a speciﬁc
health problem, or caught between disagreements
among specialists on a planned course of treatment that
may lead to dangerous polypharmacy. These circum-
stances lead to patients and families understanding about
diagnostic and treatment priorities, and thus, lessen
therapeutic trust.
Further, many of these specialty providers have lit-
tle insight, or time, to devote to collaborative care
interventions
that
coordinated
longitudinal
care
required by the complex frail older patient. Frequent
follow-up visits, or referral to other specialists, may
contribute to low value, high volume clinical out-
comes.52 This pattern of care delivery does not have
to be the case. GCSLs that are highly integrated into
hospital/healthcare systems could and should serve
as the “quarterbacks” for specialty care services coor-
dination. Evidence-based collaborative care models
for dementia patients support this assertion as they
have shown to improve outcomes in a cost-effective
manner.53,54
HEALTHCARE SYSTEM CONSOLIDATION
AND GROWTH MINDSET
The consolidation of the US hospitals and health-
care systems has been a health policy focus for over
30 years, and more recently, made more complicated
by “cross-market” healthcare system mergers.25,26,28
(Table 1) While at ﬁrst glance one might think this
trend could increase the “glue” for GCSLs because
with greater operational scale, hospitals/healthcare
systems could better resource GCSLs. But available
evidence to support this notion is weak.
Early healthcare system consolidation occurred
primarily among local or regional hospitals, particu-
larly within urban/suburban metropolitan statistical
areas (MSAs). While mergers raised anticompetitive
and antitrust concerns with Federal agencies, early
consolidation was promoted by healthcare executives
and Wall Street analysts as a means to achieve econo-
mies of scale, expand services networks, improve
quality and accessibility, and prepare for managed
care and capitation.25 These ambitious goals were
expressed as the “triple aim”, e.g., reducing per capita
cost, improving population health, and improving the
patient experience, or solving the “iron triangle”, e.g.,
Colenda and Applegate
Am J Geriatr Psychiatry 32:4, April 2024

reducing cost, improving quality, and increasing
healthcare access.55−57
The scale of US healthcare system consolidation is
sizable. The number of US hospitals/healthcare sys-
tems rose from 267 in 1980 to 407 in 2021. Further,
about 67% of US hospitals were system afﬁliated, cor-
responding to about 76% of all hospital beds in 2021.
About 2% of US healthcare systems contain 100 or
more hospitals and more than 90% of MSAs are con-
sidered highly concentrated health system markets.58
Consolidation has not been limited to just hospi-
tals/healthcare systems. Physician practice employ-
ment arrangements have evolved. The proportion of
primary care physician practices owned by a hospital
grew from 28% to 44% between 2010 and 2016, and
by 2018 more that 47% of all physicians were
employees.27,59 Within MSAs 65% were highly con-
solidated for specialists, and 39% were highly consoli-
dated
for
primary
care
physicians.27
Insurance
markets also witnessed market concentration. Within
MSAs 57% of insurers were “highly concentrated” by
2016. By 2020, four Medicare Advantage plans con-
trolled 70% of the US market.27 Ironically, many
healthcare systems are dropping Medicare Advan-
tage plans mainly because of excessive prior authori-
zation denial rates and slow payments.60
Taken together, the evidence is compelling that
the US healthcare system is moving towards an
“oligopolistic” healthcare delivery system.61 This
form of service delivery is characterized by a few
large healthcare systems that dominate regional mar-
kets and induces them to concentration on high “con-
tribution margin” service lines to maintain ﬁnancial
solvency.25,61 Given GCSLs lower contribution mar-
gins it’s not surprising that they may struggle in this
environment.
Outcomes of hospital/healthcare system consoli-
dation have been mixed. Early consolidation efforts
achieved efﬁciencies in non-concentrated markets
through reduction of duplicative services, improved
investment capabilities, and potential operational
process efﬁciency improvements. However, as health
markets become more concentrated, consolidation
reduced competition, increased healthcare system
market power leading to higher prices and reduced
quality, and created incentives to engage in anticom-
petitive behavior to preserve market dominance.62
Further, operational efﬁciencies secondary to pre-
sumed economies of scale have not been very large
such as: cash ﬂow per bed or operating expense per
adjusted discharge. Thus, impact on operational mar-
gins has been limited.62−65 Highly concentrated hos-
pital/healthcare
system
markets
increased
their
bargaining leverage with insurance companies that
led to increased hospital prices.27,62 Additionally,
physician and insurer price increases were found in
concentrated markets that eventually led to premium
increases to employers that were ultimately passed
on to individual policy holders.63,66
Quality of care and process outcomes after con-
solidation resulted in modest or mixed outcomes.
A recent hospital study of outcomes found that
patient
experience
measures
declined
modestly;
had little impact on 30-day readmission rates or
mortality;
and
effects
on
process
indicators
of
acquired hospitals were inconclusive.67 Inpatient
costs increased because of inefﬁcient patient care
processes; inpatient capacity coordination; stafﬁng
patterns; operation planning; and IT support were
difﬁcult to change.68 Another large study found
mixed quality of care outcomes evidenced by posi-
tive outcomes on a few selected clinical care proto-
cols (e.g., beta-blocker adherence, and pneumonia
readmission rates), but six of ten patient satisfac-
tion
measures
decreased
in
association
with
increased market concentration.69
Given these mixed results why does consolidation
continue
to
accelerate?
Some
health
economists
ascribe this trend to the “lionization” of the Chief
Executive Ofﬁcer, and the “culture of growth” mind-
set among healthcare system boards of directors
(Boards).25 This perspective is linked to compensation
packages for health system CEO’s, in particular, and
healthcare system senior management collectively.70
While ultimately the responsibility for a healthcare
system Boards of directors, CEO base salaries are usu-
ally benchmarked to the size of the clinical enterprise.
Annual incentive compensation is based upon health-
care system performance metrics, such as ﬁnancial
performance, selected quality outcome measures, and
progress towards achieving healthcare system strate-
gic initiatives. In most instances the healthcare sys-
tem’s overall ﬁnancial performance is the highest
weighted factor for incentive compensation. This
association is strong, and not only supported by sal-
ary surveys, but also data showing the gap between
the average CEO hourly wage to average worker
wage continues to widen, and for healthcare systems

that have 400 or more hospital beds the gap ranges
between nearly 19:1 and 60:1.70 Size matters.
POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS TO INCREASE
INVESTMENTS IN GCSLS
We fully acknowledge that US hospitals/health-
care systems require ﬁnancial underpinnings to sup-
port a wide array of clinical program priorities. As
former medical school deans and academic health
system chief executives, we’ve personally experi-
enced these pressures, and know the importance of
contribution margins to the success of our clinical
operations that support our institution’s academic
missions. On occasion we may have said to our senior
management teams, “no margin—no mission.”
However, perhaps because of our public health
training and perspectives, we were also obliged to
ﬁnd ways to sustain comprehensive systems of care
for older persons and other marginalized patient pop-
ulations. This obligation was grounded upon two
mutually reenforcing principles: a “rights-based”
approach to healthcare delivery that encompasses
patient dignity and assurances that clinical environ-
ments were free of stigma71; and the obligation of our
health systems’ social contract with our communities
because of the high proportion of operational income
from of Medicare and Medicaid. And this is where
policy recommendations1−8,71 meet hard nose politics
of change management. We offer three pragmatic sol-
utions that will be hard to execute, but necessary if
GCSLs are to achieve their full potential.
Political Advocacy Requires Understanding of
Health Policy Legislation
Effective political advocacy for GCSLs requires
understanding of the historic context of healthcare
policy legislation in the US (Table 2). The great Amer-
ican healthcare experiment produced three major
pieces of legislation (along with subsequent modiﬁca-
tions of each act) that signiﬁcantly improved the lives
of older Americans: 1) the Social Security Act (SSA) of
1935 (Public Law: 74-271); 2) Medicare and Medicaid
Act (MMA) of 1965 (Public Law: 89-97); and 3) the
2010 PPACA (Public Law 111-148).72−74 Failure to
fully appreciate these laws’ transformative impact
runs the risk of political nihilism, e.g., that “nothing
can change,” and that past successes are left to his-
tory.
Each legislative success represented hard won
political ﬁghts against intrenched opponents. The
SSA raised constitutional questions that required res-
olution by the US Supreme Court in 1937. Prior to
enactment of MMA, a nationalized health insurance
program was controversial. Opponents raised con-
cerns about “socialized medicine;” Federal and state
governments inability to manage complex insurance
programs; and escalating costs beyond revenue from
general revenues, payroll taxes, Medicare premiums;
and/or state governments inability or “political will”
to match Federal matching dollars. Costs escalated,
but the US hospital/healthcare system beneﬁted
greatly by receiving reliable revenue for clinical serv-
ices that were historically written off as charity care.
This enabled them to access capital markets that grew
their clinical enterprises. In so doing they also
incurred debt, which created ﬁnancial conditions for
both high margin service lines and hospital/health-
care system consolidation.
The 2010 PPACA legislation was “visionary” as it
expanded healthcare coverage to near universal lev-
els; provided an important proviso to fund and test
the effectiveness of innovative healthcare models; and
insisted upon periodic community health needs
assessments by hospitals/healthcare systems.74,75 The
connection of CMS’ innovation models of care with
required periodic community needs assessment by
hospitals/healthcare systems is the junction where
policy meets politics in changing priorities and stimu-
lating GCSL program investment, and achieve “age-
friendly” health care systems.6,7 By using broad-
based community coalitions (inclusive of patients,
families, organizations such as Alzheimer’s disease
and mental health advocacy groups, and local/
regional community services and governmental agen-
cies) to identify gaps in comprehensive geriatric care
services, pressure can be placed on hospitals/health-
care systems to create GCSLs. Failure of hospitals/
healthcare systems to do such should raise questions
about whether they are meeting their community
beneﬁt requirement to qualify for their non-proﬁt tax
status.75 Such efforts are “hard nose” politics, but
may be required to change priorities. Ironically, in
addition to improving outcomes for complex older
frail patients, such efforts might actually beneﬁt care
delivery operations, efﬁciencies and margins.

Expand Team Based Geriatric Physician and
Health Professional Workforce by Nontraditional
Means
The pipeline for formally trained geriatricians and
geriatric psychiatrists will never be able to meet the
population demand for their expertise and clinical
services (Table 2). Thus, without the efforts of pri-
mary care physicians and general psychiatrists, along
with advance practice professionals (APNs), the
nation’s ability to provide primary care and psychiat-
ric services to older patients would be in worse shape.
Notwithstanding, maintaining and growing the aca-
demic workforce in both disciplines are important
priorities to advance educational and scientiﬁc dis-
covery in geriatrics and gerontology. How best to do
such is debatable, and the authors have divergent
opinions based on our experiences in public and pri-
vate universities and academic healthcare systems.
As subspecialty units in medicine and psychiatry aca-
demic departments, those that do not have large
extramural research portfolios or clinical operations
may not have sway to inﬂuence departmental, school
of medicine or academic health system policy or pri-
orities in undergraduate medical education curricu-
lum, support for fellowship training programs, or
creating GCSLs.
Establishing interdisciplinary departments of Geri-
atrics, a concept that has been around for years, might
change the trajectory for academic geriatrics, but not
without signiﬁcant challenges.15,76 On the one hand
departmental status would concentrate basic, clinical

Political Advocacy Requires Understanding
of Health Policy Legislation
 Effective policy and political advocacy for GCSLs requires understanding of the historic
context of healthcare policy legislation in the US.
○Social Security Act of 1935—“Old Age Insurance Beneﬁts Program”
○Medicare Medicaid Act of 1965 created under Title XVII of the Social Security Act.
○2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) −
& Supported innovative healthcare delivery models to lower costs of care and improve

& Required periodic community needs assessments by hospitals/healthcare systems.
 Use the PPACA mandates for community needs assessment by hospital/healthcare systems
to:.
○Build community coalitions to identify service gaps in regional comprehensive geriatric
services.
○Use community coalitions to advocate, partner, and incentivize hospitals/healthcare
systems to invest in GCSLs.
○Demonstrate how investment in GCSLs will help achieve health equity for patients and
their families
○Use hospital/healthcare system tax exempt status as tool for change.
Expand Team Based Geriatric Physician
and Health Professional Workforce
 Build the capacity of Geriatric Medicine and Psychiatry in academic hospitals/health
systems.
○Establish interdisciplinary Departments of Geriatrics that raises the academic proﬁle of
geriatrics and builds the infrastructure necessary to support clinical, educational and
research responsibilities for GCSLs.
 Increase non-academic hospitals/healthcare systems GCSLs capacity.
○Build GCSL multidisciplinary team infrastructure through hospital/healthcare system
ﬁnancial investment
○Support physicians and health professionals to gain geriatric expertise through:
& Continuing professional development programs for health professionals interested in
geriatrics
& Short-term preceptor programs as academic health systems, e.g., “mini-fellowships.”
& Support of post-graduate degree programs or fellowship training
Reprioritize Healthcare System
Corporate Behavior
 Hospital/healthcare system Boards of Directors should establish explicit short- and long-

○A portion of CEO and senior executive team incentive compensation should be linked to
GCSLs development.
○Hospital/healthcare system philanthropic efforts must have GCSLs as part of their annual
development efforts.
○Expand board of director membership to patients, families and caregivers, and
community leaders representing geriatric, mental health or aging services agencies
without diluting the weight of their votes.

(geriatricians and geriatric psychiatrists), and population
health faculty with aging expertise into a single depart-
ment structure, thus increasing academic collaboration.
A departmental unit provides academic standing on
major school of medicine administrative committees
such as the dean’s executive committee or clinical serv-
ices committee. Depending upon a school’s bylaws,
representation on important educational committees
such as undergraduate curriculum, graduate medical
education or admissions committees by geriatric depart-
ment faculty might be assured to address gaps in geriat-
ric and gerontological curriculum content and selection
of prospective medical students interested in geriatrics
could be systematically considered.
We recognize the academic political hurdles to
overcome, but many academic subunits in smaller
less resourced medical schools are at the tipping point
of survival. To ensure that the future academic work-
force in geriatric is available, new approaches are
required.
For non-academic hospital/healthcare systems it is
also time to think anew about how to expand and
invest in GCSLs that will better serve the patients that
are using their healthcare system resources. To
enhance their GCSL clinical and multidisciplinary
team infrastructure and capacity, we recommend
non-academic health systems identify and ﬁnancially
invest in physicians, nurses, and other healthcare pro-
fessionals
to
gain
additional
geriatric
expertise
through continual professional development pro-
grams, short-term preceptor programs (e.g., mini-fel-
lowships), or if needed, from post-graduate degree or
formal fellowship training programs. These teams
become a hospital/healthcare system’s GCSL intellec-
tual and clinical resource that improves the scope and
quality of care for complex geriatric patients, and
become point personnel help shape geriatric program
initiatives as value-based Medicare payments inﬂu-
ence programs in the future. Additionally, GCSL
investments could be legitimately considered within
the community investment proviso necessary for
healthcare systems to retain not-for-proﬁt tax status.75
Reprioritize Healthcare Systems Expansionist
Corporate Behavior
We assert that limited GCSL investment in hospi-
tal/healthcare systems is a health inequity related to
ageism. Neither do we imply that “throwing money”
at the problem in a non-evidenced base manner is a solu-
tion. Rather, we assert that current hospital/healthcare
system growth and consolidation has created the neces-
sary ﬁnancial capacity to become incubators for GCSLs
regardless of whether their efforts are supported by PPA-
CA’s innovation programs (Table 2). Clinical and ﬁnan-
cial outcome measures are plentiful, and if measures are
sufﬁciently global and rigorously deﬁned, downstream
beneﬁts for these programs may realize “positive contri-
bution margins” along with better clinical outcomes.
To
accomplish
this
transformation,
hospital/
healthcare system Boards need to be fully engaged
with senior management; move beyond year-over-
year ﬁnancial performance; and hold management
and themselves accountable to achieve successful
GCSLs. Boards should establish explicit hospital/
healthcare system short- and long-term development
goals for GCSLs, inclusive of time-lines and develop-
mental milestone measures. To ensure executive man-
agement’s commitment, these goals must be linked to
short- and long-term incentive compensation goals
for CEOs and their senior executives. Development
teams must create mechanisms for yearly philan-
thropic events that support GCSL programs (similar
to what is done for oncology or children’s services).
Boards must actively create membership opportuni-
ties for patients, families and community leaders rep-
resenting geriatric, mental health, or aging service
agencies, without diluting the weight of their votes
by expanding the size of the board. By creating board
diversity, the voices of patients, families and commu-
nity based organizations will help create a “bottoms
up” movement to counter the headwinds against
GCSLs creation. These headwinds are not just ﬁnan-
cial. In our opinion, they also represent organizational
biases toward agism, ableism, and mental health
stigma.1−8,71
While
these
actions
may
not
slow-down
expansionistic hospital/healthcare system behavior,
it may build guardrails to help mitigate perpetuation
of health inequities that is aligned with “rights-based”
healthcare delivery.71 There is clear evidence that US
hospitals/healthcare systems can adapt quickly to
changing clinical and environmental pressures. The
COVID-19 pandemic required hospital/healthcare
systems to shift their priorities from the high vol-
ume/high contribution margin service lines towards
managing complex critically ill patients.77−79 The
ﬁnancial integrity the US healthcare system was
Colenda and Applegate
Am J Geriatr Psychiatry 32:4, April 2024
401
sustained by substantial tax payer support from both
direct Federal investments and relaxation of regula-
tory policy to help weather the ﬁnancial perils of the
pandemic.80,81
Unfortunately, in our opinion, the unintended con-
sequence of this support in the post pandemic era has
been the acceleration of cross-market mergers of
healthcare systems
that
are more complex
and
focused on high margin clinical service lines. Further,
if the history of healthcare consolidation preordains
future success, we’re pretty sure arguments that sup-
port cross-market mergers will not be fully realized,
and that investments in GCSLs may continue to be
marginalized. To avoid this pessimistic outcome, it’s
time hold healthcare system executives and their
Boards accountable to their community beneﬁts mis-
sion. It will be hard!
CONCLUSIONS
This review uses an organizational and ﬁnancial
lens to examine why CGSLs have failed to become
widely disseminated within our US hospital/health-
care system. Worries about workforce, service deliv-
ery organization and ﬁnancing of healthcare services
for the elderly is not new, but there is a new urgency
for solutions given the rise in the 65+ population. We
believe that application of hard nose “politics” to
organizational
change
is
required.
Such
efforts
require reframing hospital/healthcare systems priori-
ties towards a “rights” based approach to GCSL
investment, and the creation of innovative strategies
to build a sustainable geriatric healthcare workforce.
Transformational hospital/healthcare system change
will occur when patients, their families and care-
givers, and community agencies are appointed to
governance boards. Thereby providing them have a
seat at the table to set strategy and policy for geriatric
care services and health equity, and act as a buttress
against unchecked ﬁnancial growth and consolida-
tion. It will be hard to glue the geriatric system of care
together. But now is the time for “united action.”71

We study the effect of the US Affordable Care Act (ACA) on healthcare borrowing costs. 
The ACA provides insurance subsidies to low-income enrollees. States could accept fund- 
ing to expand Medicaid, although many declined, citing the cost burden. The ACA signiﬁ- 
cantly reduced healthcare yields after a favorable 2012 Supreme Court ruling. Furthermore, 
hospital investment spending increased, and investment-cash ﬂow sensitivities decreased. 
The yield effect was double in Medicaid expansion states, and insigniﬁcant in rural areas 
of non-expansion states. Our results highlight how the municipal market can be used to 
evaluate the heterogeneous effects of public policy and guide a targeted policy approach.

1. Introduction 
The Affordable Care Act (ACA) is widely considered 
to be the most signiﬁcant regulatory overhaul of the US 
healthcare system since the passage of Medicaid and Medi- 
care in 1965. 
1 Signed into law in March 2010, the ACA pro- 
vides low-income US residents with better access to health 
insurance through a combination of federal subsidies for 
low-income households and an expansion of the income 
threshold for Medicaid eligibility. Hospitals in the US have 
1 The 
Affordable 
Care 
Act, 
formally 
known 
as 
the 
Patient 
Protection 
and 
Affordable 
Care 
Act, 
is 
often 
referred 
to 
as 
“Obamacare” because 
of 
its 
as- 
sociation with President Barack Obama, who strongly endorsed the bill 
and 
signed 
it 
into 
law 
during 
his 
ﬁrst 
presidential 
term. 
Medicaid 
is 
a 
fed- 
eral and state program that provides healthcare subsidies 
for low-income 
US enrollees. Medicare is a federal program that provides health insur- 
ance for US residents aged 65 or older.

largely beneﬁted from the expanded insured customer 
base since the ACA went into effect in 2014 ( 
Dranove et al., 
2016; Duggan et al., 2020 
). However, the beneﬁts to hospi- 
tals signiﬁcantly differ across states because several states 
have rejected the option to accept federal subsidies to ex- 
pand Medicaid eligibility under the ACA, citing the addi- 
tional cost burden to the state. Another major issue high- 
lighted by policymakers is that hospital default risk may 
increase over time due to ongoing ACA-associated cuts to 
Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates by the federal 
government, which was responsible for $1.5 trillion of US 
healthcare spending, or 43% of all US healthcare spending, 
in 2017 alone ( 
Selden et al., 2015; Committee for a Respon- 
sible Federal Budget, 2018; Young et al., 2019 
). In light of 
the competing effects stemming from the higher insured 
rate, higher cost burden to the state, and lower anticipated 
reimbursement rates, the purpose of this study is to test 
how the ACA has affected US hospital credit risk. 
We use the healthcare municipal bond market to study 
hospital credit risk around the implementation of the ACA. 
Healthcare municipal bond yields are forward-looking and 
reﬂect the long-term market consensus about hospital de- 
fault risk. Healthcare municipal bonds are also one of the 
main sources of ﬁnancing for non-proﬁt hospitals, which 
represent about 70% of all hospitals in the US. Further un- 
derscoring the importance of these bonds for healthcare 
infrastructure development, the American Hospital Associ- 
ation (AHA), which represents 50 
0 
0 member hospitals and 
270,0 
0 
0 aﬃliated physicians, has stressed that “the ability 
to obtain tax-exempt ﬁnancing is a key beneﬁt of hospital 
tax-exemption that works to make access to vital hospi- 
tal services available in communities large and small across 
America” ( 
American Hospital Association, 2017 
; pg. 1). 
We show that the ACA signiﬁcantly reduced hospital 
credit risk. In particular, we show that healthcare munic- 
ipal bond yields immediately decreased by 8 bps after the 
US Supreme Court narrowly upheld the constitutionality of 
the ACA in 2012, and by about 20 bps over the following 
three years. The Supreme Court ruling (SCR) represents an 
important shock to the probability that the ACA provisions 
would remain in place. The yield change is measured rela- 
tive to a control group of non-healthcare municipal bonds 
that were not affected by the Supreme Court ruling. The 
immediate yield change is also highly economically signif- 
icant, representing 5.9% of the average default spread be- 
tween Aaa-rated and Baa-rated municipal bonds, $460,0 
0 
0 
in present-value interest savings on the average healthcare 
issue, and $360 million in aggregate interest savings on all 
healthcare municipal bonds issued from mid-2012 to 2015. 
Overall, our results indicate that the positive insurance ef- 
fect for hospitals (the “demand effect”) dominates the neg- 
ative reimbursement effect (the “supply effect”). 
We further identify the demand effect on healthcare 
yields by exploiting variation in the state-level decisions 
to expand Medicaid as part of the ACA. The ACA origi- 
nally required that states expand their Medicaid eligibil- 
ity ceilings to 138% of the federal poverty line. The fed- 
eral government would subsidize 90% of the expansion 
cost in the long run. However, the Supreme Court also 
ruled in 2012 that states are not required to expand Medi- 
caid and accept federal funding. As a result, only 25 states 
voted at different times to expand Medicaid before the 
ACA went into effect in January 2014. We ﬁnd that the 
decrease in state-level healthcare yields is twice as large 
if the state votes to expand Medicaid. The incremental ef- 
fect in Medicaid expansion states remains robust even af- 
ter controlling for yield trends within credit rating cate- 
gory, state, and bond type (healthcare vs. non-healthcare). 
The incremental yield change corresponds to additional in- 
terest savings of $250 million for healthcare bonds issued 
in those states. The yield change is similar in states that 
voted to expand Medicaid later due to concerns about the 
cost of expansion, and non-healthcare yields were unaf- 
fected by Medicaid expansion. In combination, this evi- 
dence suggests that concerns about the incremental Medi- 
caid cost burden on state budgets are likely overstated. In 
supporting tests, we ﬁnd that emergency room (ER) us- 
age by Medicaid-insured residents signiﬁcantly increases 
in Medicaid expansion states, while ER usage by privately- 
insured residents signiﬁcantly increases in non-expansion 
states, although to a lesser extent. However, there are no 
economically meaningful changes in longer-term inpatient 
procedures relative to ER procedures in any payor category. 
Thus, the ACA-associated reductions in hospital credit risk 
are strongly related to demand-driven changes in ER usage, 
especially in the Medicaid expansion states. 
Our baseline results suggest that the ACA spurred hos- 
pital investment growth and relaxed hospitals’ ﬁnancial 
constraints, highlighting the real effects of the ACA on 
healthcare ﬁnance outcomes. Adelino et al. (2015) show 
that the sensitivity of hospitals’ investment spending to 
endowment cash ﬂow shocks is primarily due to ﬁnancial 
constraints, with higher sensitivities observed for more ﬁ- 
nancially constrained hospitals. Using the methodology in 
Adelino et al. (2015) 
, we show that investment spending 
signiﬁcantly increased and investment-cash ﬂow sensitiv- 
ities signiﬁcantly decreased following the implementation 
of the ACA, particularly over longer-term investment hori- 
zons. This evidence suggests that the ACA relaxed hospi- 
tals’ ﬁnancial constraints and reduced their dependence 
on endowment returns for investment decisions. This evi- 
dence is also externally consistent with a Standard & Poor’s 
report on non-proﬁt US hospitals showing that standard 
measures of hospital ﬁnancial constraints, such as the ratio 
of interest expense to revenue (debt burden), the ratio of 
cash level to interest expense (cushion ratio), and the ra- 
tio of unrestricted reserves to long-term debt became less 
constrained after the implementation of the ACA ( 
Standard 
& Poor’s, 2018 
). 
Additional evidence in the cross-section of hospitals 
provides further insight into the ACA-associated demand 
and supply effects on yields. First, we ﬁnd that the reduc- 
tion in hospital credit risk around the ACA Supreme Court 
ruling is only signiﬁcant in urban areas, which is consistent 
with prior evidence that government expansions of health 
insurance through private markets are relatively intractable 
in rural areas, as rural populations tends to be older and 
sicker, and are generally not large enough to spread risk 
for insurance providers ( 
Gold, 2008; Berkes, 2009 
). How- 
ever, we also ﬁnd that rural healthcare yields signiﬁcantly 
decrease if the state expands Medicaid, underlining the 
importance of larger insurance subsidies for low-income 
465

Journal of Financial Economics 145 (2022) 464–488 
residents in rural areas. Second, we ﬁnd that the reduc- 
tion in hospital credit risk around the Supreme Court de- 
cision is only signiﬁcant in counties that were less reliant 
on Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) subsidies from 
the federal government, and thus less exposed to the siz- 
able ACA-associated DSH cuts. 
2 However, hospitals in high- 
DSH counties also experience a reduction in credit risk if 
the state votes to expand Medicaid, underlining the impor- 
tance of the increased Medicaid subsidies in high-DSH ar- 
eas for reducing the debt cost of capital for hospitals. From 
a general perspective, our cross-sectional results highlight 
how the municipal market can be used to evaluate the het- 
erogeneous effects of public policy and thus guide a more 
targeted policy approach, especially for non-proﬁt organi- 
zations that rely on government subsidies. 
Finally, 
we 
examine 
how 
healthcare 
munici- 
pal bond yields were affected by ACA uncertainty. 
Koijen et al. (2016) provide evidence of a sizable “medical 
innovation premium” in healthcare equity markets, which 
stems from the risk that the federal government may sig- 
niﬁcantly cut reimbursement payments to hospitals. In a 
similar fashion, healthcare municipal bonds may also price 
the uncertainty of ACA repeal. We test the ACA effect on 
healthcare yields by bond maturity, with the intuition that 
longer-term bonds are more exposed to the longer-term 
risk that the executive and legislative branches of the US 
government will eventually align in agreement to repeal 
the ACA. Consistent with this intuition, we ﬁnd that the 
ACA-associated reduction in yields is lower for long-term 
healthcare bonds (11 bps) than short-term healthcare 
bonds (23 bps). When we separate out the cash ﬂows on 
long-term bonds into their long-term and short-term com- 
ponents, we ﬁnd that the implied yield on the long-term 
component increases by 2 bps, further suggesting that 
long-run ACA uncertainty is priced in healthcare municipal 
bond markets. Therefore, the ability of local municipalities 
to cheaply ﬁnance healthcare infrastructure in the long 
run is still somewhat constrained by repeal risk. 
Our study contributes to the literature at the inter- 
section of health economics and ﬁnance. Hult and Philip- 
son ( 
2012 
; pg. 2) stress that government expansions often 
“lower demand prices to improve access to healthcare but 
also lower supply prices (reimbursements) through gov- 
ernment monopsony power.” Koijen et al. (2016) show that 
healthcare equity investors price the risk that the govern- 
ment will adjust reimbursement schedules for hospitals in 
an effort to control costs. Furthermore, R&D spending in 
the healthcare industry has also been lower because of 
this risk. We show that the ACA, widely considered to be 
the most important healthcare regulation since the passage 
of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965, signiﬁcantly reduced 
healthcare borrowing costs through the subsidy-driven de- 
mand channel, even with the expected decline in reim- 
bursement rates and greater intervention risks from the

). 
federal government. Adelino et al. (2015) show that invest- 
ment spending by nonproﬁt hospitals, particularly those 
that are ﬁnancially constrained, is positively related to cash 
ﬂow shocks from the hospital’s endowment fund. Using a 
later sample period, we show that the ACA signiﬁcantly 
decreased the sensitivity of hospital investments to en- 
dowment cash ﬂow shocks, supporting our baseline evi- 
dence that the ACA reduced hospital credit risk and re- 
laxed ﬁnancial constraints. To the best of our knowledge, 
our study is the ﬁrst to document the real effects of the 
ACA on healthcare investment spending. 
Our study also contributes to the literature on health- 
care regulation and the associated ﬁnancial outcomes in 
the healthcare industry. A number of studies show that 
state-level Medicaid expansions have had ﬁnancial bene- 
ﬁts for hospitals in the form of reduced uncompensated 
care costs ( 
Dranove et al., 2016; Finkelstein et al., 2019 
), 
increased revenues and proﬁtability ( 
Lindrooth et al., 2018; 
Duggan et al., 2020 
), and a decreased likelihood of ru- 
ral hospital closures ( 
Lindrooth et al., 2018 
). However, 
most of these studies focus on realized short-run hospi- 
tal outcomes because post-ACA data have only been avail- 
able since 2014. We contribute to this literature by show- 
ing that long-run expectations of hospital ﬁnancial perfor- 
mance, as reﬂected by healthcare municipal bond yields, 
have also signiﬁcantly improved but strongly depend on 
the type of hospital. Our empirical approach also allows 
improved identiﬁcation of the ACA effects on healthcare 
markets in general because we can measure these effects 
against a credible control group of non-healthcare munici- 
pal bonds that were not affected by the ACA. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In 
Section 2 
, we provide background on the ACA and motiva- 
tion for our main empirical tests. In Section 3 
, we provide 
details about the bond- and county-level data used in this 
analysis and associated summary statistics. In Section 4 
, 
we present our central results showing how healthcare 
yields were affected by the landmark ACA Supreme Court 
ruling and the state-level decisions to expand Medicaid. 
In Section 5 
, we examine how the ACA affected hospitals’ 
real investment spending and the sensitivity of investment 
spending to cash ﬂow shocks. In Section 6 
, we provide evi- 
dence of the ACA yield effect in the cross-section of bonds 
and counties. We conclude in Section 7 
. 
2. ACA background and empirical approach 
The ACA was signed into law by President Barack 
Obama in March 2010. The law is designed to provide 
a larger cross-section of US citizens and legal residents 
with better access to health insurance. Two of the major 
ACA provisions offer health insurance subsidies to lower- 
income households. In particular, the two provisions orig- 
inally required that: (1) households with an income be- 
tween 100% and 400% of the federal poverty line are eli- 
gible to receive federal subsidies for private health insur- 
ance policies purchased on ACA exchanges; and (2) states 
expand the Medicaid eligibility income threshold to 138% 
of the federal poverty line or lose all federal Medicaid 
funding. The ACA also stipulated that the federal govern- 
ment would initially pay 100% of the incremental cost 
466 
P. Gao, C. Lee and D. Murphy 
Journal of Financial Economics 145 (2022) 464–488 
of the state-level Medicaid expansion, although this was 
scheduled to gradually decrease to 90% in 2020 and be- 
yond. Therefore, states would eventually be responsible for 
paying 10% of the Medicaid expansion cost. In 2016, the 
Congressional Budget Oﬃce (CBO) estimated that approx- 
imately 12 million people in any given month are cov- 
ered by insurance purchased through the ACA exchanges, 
10 million of whom receive federal subsidies to purchase 
their coverage. The CBO also estimated that an additional 
11 million people became Medicaid-eligible because of the 
Medicaid expansion provision of the ACA ( 
Congressional 
Budget Oﬃce, 2016 
). Research shows that the uninsured 
rate in the US signiﬁcantly decreased due to the ACA 
( 
Sommers et al., 2014, 2015; Courtemanche et al., 2017; 
Frean et al., 2017; Duggan et al., 2020 
). 
The implementation of the ACA was scheduled for Jan- 
uary 2014, although there were signiﬁcant uncertainties 
about whether it would survive legal challenges or re- 
peal effort 
s by the legislative branch of the US govern- 
ment. However, in June 2012, much of the legal uncertainty 
surrounding the ACA was resolved when the US Supreme 
Court ruled in favor of the constitutionality of the ACA in 
a landmark case titled National Federation of Independent 
Business v. Sebelius 
. As a result, the US Congress retained its 
power to enact most of the provisions associated with the 
ACA. In the same case, however, the Supreme Court also 
ruled that the Medicaid expansion provision of the ACA 
was “unconstitutionally coercive.” Therefore, states would 
not lose their current levels of Medicaid funding if they 
decided not to participate in the Medicaid expansion. By 
the end of 2013, only 25 of the 50 US states chose to ex- 
pand their Medicaid programs and receive the associated 
federal funding. The remaining 25 states initially rejected 
an expansion of Medicaid due to the additional cost bur- 
den to the state. However, 12 of these states eventually ap- 
proved Medicaid expansion between 2014 and 2018, mean- 
ing 13 states have not approved Medicaid expansion as of 
December 2018. The median Medicaid eligibility thresh- 
old for the non-expansion states remains at about 43% of 
the federal poverty line ( 
Kaiser Family Foundation, 2019 
). 
Figure 1 is a map of the states that voted to expand Med- 
icaid before January 2014 and the states that voted to ex- 
pand Medicaid between 2014 and 2018. The ﬁgure shows 
that most of the states that voted to expand Medicaid be- 
fore 2014 are in the Northeastern and Western US. Un- 
surprisingly, many of these states are Democratic-leaning, 
such as New York, California, and Massachusetts. However, 
there are several Republican-leaning states that voted to 
expand Medicaid before 2014 as well, including Arkansas, 
Kentucky, and North Dakota. 
The ACA is mostly ﬁnanced by three major cuts to 
government healthcare spending and additional taxes on 
high-income earners and health insurers. The CBO esti- 
mates that the ACA-associated cuts to healthcare spending 
will save the federal government approximately $700 bil- 
lion over a ten-year period ( 
Congressional Budget Oﬃce, 
2012 
). The ﬁrst cut involves a reduction in the regularly- 
scheduled annual increases in Medicare payments to hos- 
pitals and other healthcare providers over a ten-year pe- 
riod. The second cut is an elimination of the subsidy to pri- 
vate health insurers in the Medicare Advantage program, 
which provides Medicare beneﬁciaries with the choice to 
receive their Medicare beneﬁts through a private insur- 
ance plan. The third cut is a reduction in DSH payments 
to hospitals that provide services to uninsured and low- 
income patients, with the expectation that increased in- 
surance coverage under the ACA would reduce uncom- 
pensated care costs for hospitals. Individuals earning more 
than $20 
0,0 
0 
0 per year are also now subject to an addi- 
tional Medicare tax of 0.9%. A second Medicare tax of 3.8% 
was implemented in a companion piece of legislation titled 
the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 and 
is applicable to the lesser of net investment income or the 
excess of modiﬁed gross adjusted income above $20 
0,0 
0 
0 
for individuals. 
Extant research shows that short-run hospital ﬁnan- 
cial performance has improved following the imple- 
mentation of the ACA in January 2014. In particular, 
Dranove et al. (2016) show that there was a signiﬁcant 
decrease in the uncompensated care burden for hospitals, 
while Duggan et al. (2020) show that there was a signiﬁ- 
cant increase in healthcare service demand on the exten- 
sive margin from newly-insured patients. Even prior to the 
implementation of the ACA, healthcare issuers noted these 
anticipated economic beneﬁts to potential lenders. In 2013, 
for example, Northwestern Memorial HealthCare, a not-for- 
proﬁt corporation that operates hospitals in the Chicago 
metropolitan area, stated the following in its municipal 
bond prospectus: “An increase in utilization of health care 
services by those who are currently avoiding or rationing 
their health care can be expected and bad debt expenses 
and/or charity care provided may be reduced” ( 
Municipal 
Securities Rulemaking Board, 2013 
; pg. 23). 
The 
improvements 
in 
hospital 
ﬁnancial 
perfor- 
mance may not persist in the long run, however. 
Young et al. (2019) note that the reduction in uncom- 
pensated care costs documented in other studies has 
been partially offset by a reduction in Medicaid reim- 
bursement rates. Shatto and Clemens (2018) warn that 
the ongoing ACA-associated cuts to reimbursement rates 
may not be sustainable for hospitals in the long run, 
even with the reduction in uncompensated care. Theoret- 
ical studies also underline these concerns. For example, 
Hult and Philipson (2012) note that the increased market 
power held by the federal and state governments through 
a large healthcare program like the ACA may lead to 
additional reimbursement cuts to hospitals over time. 
Koijen et al. (2016) further note that the expected proﬁts 
for hospitals may be discounted more heavily because of 
the “disaster risk” that the federal government will cut 
reimbursements to hospitals and thus shrink their proﬁt 
margins. From a ﬁnance perspective, the expected reim- 
bursement cuts and risk of additional cuts may depress 
the prices of hospital-related securities if the positive 
demand effect stemming from newly-insured patients is 
not suﬃciently large. 
We use the healthcare municipal bond market to test 
the net effect of the ACA on hospital credit risk. Ap- 
proximately 80% of the yield spread between municipal 
bonds and the US Treasuries is attributable to default risk 
( 
Schwert, 2017 
), and default risk is strongly related to long- 
run expectations about the proﬁtability of the underlying

project. We largely focus on changes in municipal bond 
yields around two important events in this study: (1) the 
Supreme Court ruling about the constitutionality of the 
ACA in June 2012, and (2) the state-level decisions to ex- 
pand Medicaid. The Supreme Court ruling represents a 
large and positive shock to the probability that the ACA 
provisions would remain in place. The staggered adoption 
of Medicaid at the state level is also useful for identifying 
the demand-driven ACA effect on long-term hospital cash 
ﬂows. Finally, an important advantage of focusing on mu- 
nicipal bond markets is that these markets are largely seg- 
mented into 50 different US states because of the preferen- 
tial tax treatment given to investors who purchase munici- 
pal bonds issued in their home state ( 
Schultz, 2012; Babina 
et al., 2021 
). Thus, we can test the heterogeneous effect of 
the state-level ACA Medicaid expansion decisions on mu- 
nicipal bond yields across these segmented markets. 
3. Data and summary statistics 
3.1. Bond-level data and summary statistics 
We collect municipal bond offering yields and charac- 
teristics from 2011 to 2015 using the Mergent Municipal 
Bond Securities Database. Speciﬁcally, for each bond, the 
Mergent database provides the offering yield, the state of 
issuance, issue series, issuance date, maturity date, coupon 
rate, bond size, as well as bond ratings from Moody’s and 
Standard and Poor’s (if the bond is rated). The bond char- 
acteristics also include whether the bond is general obliga- 
tion (GO), insured, or callable. (A GO bond is backed by the 
tax base of the issuing municipality; if a bond is not GO, 
then it is a revenue bond, which is backed by the revenues 
generated by the underlying project.) The database con- 
tains information on the use of proceeds from each bond 
issuance, which we use to identify the healthcare munici- 
pal bonds in our sample. The county locations and ultimate 
borrower identiﬁers of municipal issuers are collected from 
Bloomberg and matched to each municipal bond. We ex- 
clude municipal bonds with a maturity of more than 100 
years, an offering yield that is greater than 50 percentage 
points, or a variable or zero coupon rate. We also exclude 
pre-refunded bonds, which are not recorded as liabilities 
because the bond payments are funded by an escrow ac- 
count of US Treasuries until the bond is called at its ﬁrst 
call date, bonds that are subject to federal taxes, or bonds 
that do not have county location information. Finally, we 
only include bonds that are issued in the US states in our

sample. Bonds issued in US territories are excluded be- 
cause the issuance rates are very low and the residents are 
not subject to most of the provisions of the ACA. 
Municipal bond transaction-level prices and yields on 
the secondary market are collected from the Municipal Se- 
curities Rulemaking Board (MSRB) database. The data con- 
sist of all intraday broker-dealer municipal bond trades for 
the 2011 to 2015 period. Each observation includes the 
bond price, yield, par value traded, and whether the trade 
was a customer purchase from a broker-dealer, customer 
sale to a broker-dealer, or an interdealer trade. A majority 
of our empirical tests are conducted at the monthly fre- 
quency. To convert the MSRB database to a monthly fre- 
quency, we take the average secondary yield of all cus- 
tomer buy transactions within each bond-month, weighted 
by the par value traded. We exclude municipal bonds with 
fewer than ten secondary transactions. Unless otherwise 
stated, we restrict our sample to the secondary yields of 
seasoned municipal bonds that have been outstanding for 
at least one year. Finally, to account for outlier transac- 
tions, we exclude secondary yields that are in the top or 
bottom 0.1 percentile of the secondary yield distribution. 
We also supplement our municipal bond data from a 
variety of sources, including the Healthcare Cost Report In- 
formation System (HCRIS) database for hospital ﬁnancial 
statement information, the Healthcare Costs and Utiliza- 
tion Project (HCUP) database for hospital visit information, 
the Medicaid.gov website for county-level DSH payment 
data, and the IHS Markit database for state-level credit 
default swap spread data. We obtain state- and county- 
level economic indicators and ﬁnancial information from 
the Federal Reserve Economic Data website, the Census 
State and Local Government website, and the Federal Re- 
serve Board of Governors website. 
Table 1 presents summary statistics for the health- 
care and non-healthcare municipal bonds issued during 
our sample period. Healthcare municipal bonds are is- 
sued to ﬁnance hospitals and healthcare facilities, and 
non-healthcare municipal bonds are used to ﬁnance other 
projects in many other sectors, including education, trans- 
portation, waterworks, and public housing. There were 
about 13,0 
0 
0 healthcare municipal bonds issued during 
our sample period, at an average bond size of $6.7 mil- 
lion. The size of the average healthcare issuance pack- 
age ($72.4 million) is about three times larger than the 
size of the average non-healthcare issuance package ($23.5 
million), which is reﬂective of the healthcare sector be- 
ing more equipment- and labor-intensive than other sec- 
tors. The healthcare sector also has the second-largest av- 
erage issuance size, with the transportation sector being 
the largest. 
The summary statistics in Table 1 also indicate that 
healthcare municipal bonds are riskier than their non- 
healthcare counterparts. In particular, the average health- 
care offering yield (2.92%) is about one-third higher than 
the average non-healthcare offering yield (2.21%). Similarly, 
the average credit rating for healthcare municipal bonds is 
about two notches lower than the average non-healthcare 
municipal bond rating, where a lower notch represents a 
riskier bond. Part of the reason that healthcare munici- 
pal bond yields are higher and credit ratings are lower is 
that a much smaller proportion of healthcare bonds are GO 
(12.2%) than non-healthcare bonds (60.3%). GO bonds are 
generally perceived as safer than revenue bonds because 
they are backed by the tax base of the municipality instead 
of the revenues speciﬁc to the underlying project. How- 
ever, even when we condition on whether or not the bond 
is GO, we ﬁnd that healthcare yields are 38 bps higher 
in the GO category and 52 bps in the revenue category. 
3 
Reﬂecting these observations, Gao et al. (2019) show that 
20% of all municipal bond defaults from 1999 to 2010 oc- 
curred in the healthcare sector, which is second only to 
the industrial development sector at 26%. The higher yields 
and lower credit ratings in the healthcare sector are likely 
reﬂective of hospitals’ reliance on government programs 
such as Medicaid and Medicare for their revenue streams, 
in addition to uncertainties surrounding possible changes 
to the healthcare market and insurance laws. In our main 
tests, we control for yield trends within credit rating and 
bond characteristic categories to ensure that any changes 
in healthcare yields relative to non-healthcare yields are 
not being inﬂuenced by differing trends in these underly- 
ing categories. 
3.2. County-level data and summary statistics 
Thirty-seven states approved the expansion of Medicaid 
during our sample period, and 25 of these states approved 
before the ACA went into effect in January 2014. We col- 
lect these expansion dates from healthinsurance.org and 
the Kaiser Family Foundation website. We also collect the

for 
the 
38 
bps 
difference 
is 
that 
a 
larger 
proportion 
of 
healthcare 
GO 
bonds 
are 
limited 
tax 
(41%) 
compared 
to 
non-healthcare 
GO bonds (20%). Therefore, the average healthcare GO bond is riskier be- 
cause the taxing district has limits on how much it can raise property 
taxes 
to 
cover 
GO 
bond 
payments. 
Another 
potential 
reason 
for 
the 
38 
bps 
difference 
is 
that 
healthcare 
GO 
bonds 
are 
more 
likely 
to 
be 
backed 
by 
the 
property taxes of the surrounding medical district, as opposed to bonds 
from other sectors that are more likely to be backed by the tax base of 
the broader municipality or county. In our main regressions, we include 
GO ﬁxed effects within each year-month as controls. Our results do not 
change if we separately include limited tax and unlimited tax GO ﬁxed 
effects within each year-month.

2013 rural-urban continuum codes for individual counties 
from the US Department of Agriculture website to classify 
each county as urban or rural. In particular, each county is 
assigned a rural-urban continuum code from one to nine, 
and a county is in a metropolitan area if it was assigned 
a code of three or less. Thus, we deﬁne a county as urban 
if it was assigned a code of three or less, and rural oth- 
erwise. Annual county population and income per capita 
data are collected from the US Bureau of Economic Analy- 
sis. Finally, for each county-year, we collect the number of 
hospitals and number of hospital employees from the Area 
Health Resources Files database, which is provided by the 
US Department of Health and Human Services. 
Table 2 reports summary statistics for the 25 states that 
voted to expand Medicaid before 2014 and the remaining 
25 states that did not. There are 1179 counties in the Med- 
icaid expansion states, 62% of which are considered rural 
counties. The average county per capita income is $36,251 
and the median county population is 30,526. In compari- 
son, there are 1949 counties in the non-Medicaid expan- 
sion states, 64% of which are considered rural. The average 
per capita income is $34,339 and the median population 
is 23,433, indicating that these counties are less populated 
and have slightly lower per capita incomes than counties 
in Medicaid expansion states. 
Table 2 also shows that healthcare demographics in 
Medicaid and non-Medicaid expansion states were slightly 
different at the beginning of our sample period. In 2009, 
15% of the population was uninsured in the non-Medicaid 
expansion states, compared to 13% in the Medicaid- 
expansion states. The difference in 2009 is likely at- 
tributable to the higher fraction of low-income residents 
in non-Medicaid expansion states who cannot afford pri- 
vate insurance and do not meet the federal requirements 
for Medicaid eligibility ( 
Kaiser Family Foundation, 2018 
). 
Counties in non-Medicaid expansion states also have more 
hospitals per 10 
0,0 
0 
0 people compared to Medicaid expan- 
sion states (6.3 vs. 4.7), which likely reﬂects the sparser 
county populations for the former group. For either state 
type, we ﬁnd that there are over three times as many hos- 
pitals per 10 
0,0 
0 
0 people in rural areas compared to urban 
areas, indicating a prevalence of smaller hospitals in rural 
areas and larger hospital complexes in urban areas. Finally, 
for both state types, we ﬁnd that the number of healthcare 
personnel per 10 
0,0 
0 
0 people is fairly similar at approxi- 
mately 1400, regardless of whether the county is located 
in an urban or rural area. 
4. The effect of the ACA on hospital borrowing costs 
4.1. Baseline results 
The purpose of this study is to test the net effect of 
the ACA on hospital borrowing costs. The main dependent 
variable is the municipal bond yield spread, which is de- 
ﬁned as the difference between the municipal bond yield 
and the yield on a coupon-equivalent US Treasury bond. 
4 
This is a standard measure of the risk premium on ﬁxed 
income securities that is used in other ﬁxed income stud- 
ies, such as Longstaff et al. (2005) 
. Depending on the test, 
we rely on either municipal bond secondary yield spreads, 
offering yield spreads, or both. 
We begin our analysis by examining the time series 
evolution of healthcare versus non-healthcare municipal 
bond secondary yield spreads in a narrow window around 
the Supreme Court decision in June 2012. Similar to the 
approach in Adelino et al. (2017) 
, we restrict the sample 
to the four months prior to and four months after the key 
event, the Supreme Court decision, and test the following 
ordinary least squares (OLS) regression model: 
4 We calculate the yield on the coupon-equivalent risk-free bond as 
follows. For each municipal bond, we calculate the present value of 
its coupon payments and face value using the off-the-run US Treasury 
yield curve, which is based on the zero-coupon yield curve estimated in 
Gürkaynak et al. (2007) 
. This gives us the price of the coupon-equivalent 
risk-free 
bond. 
The 
risk-free 
yield-to-maturity 
is 
then 
calculated 
using 
this 
price and the payout schedule for the bond. The yield spread is calcu- 
lated as the difference between the municipal bond yield and the risk- 
free yield-to-maturity. This is similar to the yield spread calculation in 
Longstaff et al. (2005) 
.

5 Because the ACA Supreme Court ruling and Medicaid expansion de- 
cisions may also affect the credit rating, we use an ex ante measure of 
credit risk for each borrower. In particular, we calculate the average pre- 
SCR credit rating (rounded to the nearest integer) based on the ultimate 
borrower 
and 
insurance 
status 
of 
the 
bond. 
The 
borrower 
is 
identiﬁed 
us- 
ing the ultimate borrower ID from Bloomberg. The ﬁrst six digits of the 
bond’s CUSIP number can also be used to weakly identify the borrower. 
However, we use the ultimate borrower ID from Bloomberg because the 
same 
six-digit 
CUSIP 
number 
can 
be 
assigned 
to 
multiple 
borrowers 
(3.4% 
of all six-digit CUSIPs), and multiple six-digit CUSIP numbers can be as- 
signed to the same borrower (9.1% of all borrowers). We also note that 
our results are not signiﬁcantly different if we use the contemporane- 
ous credit rating of the issuer, which suggests that PostSCR healthcare 
credit rating changes do not contain any incremental information about 
default risk that was not already reﬂected in market prices, on average.

suance, credit rating category, and the remaining bond 
characteristics in Z, such as the insurance indicator, which 
is known to have a time-varying effect on yields due to 
the perceived default risk of the municipal bond insurers 
( 
Cornaggia et al., 2021a 
). 
A time series graph of the βH 
t coeﬃcients is reported 
in Fig. 2 
. According to the graph, the βH 
t coeﬃcients re- 
main fairly stable and statistically indistinguishable from 
zero during the months leading up to the Supreme Court 
decision, indicating that there was no unexplained trend 
in healthcare yields relative to non-healthcare yields dur- 
ing the pre-event window. Importantly, we ﬁnd that the 
average healthcare yield sharply drops by about 8 bps rela- 
tive to the average non-healthcare yield after the Supreme 
Court decision. The 8 bps effect is economically signiﬁcant, 
representing about 5.9% of the average default spread be- 
tween Aaa-rated and Baa-rated municipal bonds, $460,0

0 
in present-value interest savings on the average healthcare 
issue, and $360 million in aggregate interest savings on all 
healthcare municipal bonds issued between mid-2012 to 
2015. 
6 The yield difference also remains fairly persistent 
and highly statistically signiﬁcant in the post-event win- 
dow. Therefore, our results suggest that the ACA signiﬁ- 
cantly reduced hospital credit risk following a resolution of 
uncertainty about the constitutionality of the ACA in June 
2012.

healthcare yields does not represent the total effect of the

a culmination of multiple lower court rulings about the 
ACA, and each of these lower court rulings also affected 
the market-perceived probability that the ACA would not 
be struck down through legal channels. In late 2010, for ex- 
ample, the District Courts for the Eastern District of Michi- 
gan and the Western District of Virginia ruled that the 
ACA was constitutional, increasing the likelihood that the 
ACA would survive legal challenges ( 
Sack, 2010; Denniston, 
2010 
). However, in early 2011, the District Court for the 
Northern District of Florida ruled that the ACA’s individual 
mandate, which requires that US residents purchase health 
insurance or else pay a penalty, was unconstitutional. Fur- 
thermore, the court ruled that the individual mandate was 
“not severable” from the rest of the ACA, meaning that the 
entirety of the ACA would also have to be struck down 
( 
Brown, 2011 
). However, in November 2011, the US Court 
of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled that the ACA 
was indeed constitutional; this decision was somewhat un- 
expected because the three-judge panel was dominated by 
conservative judges ( 
Ungar, 2011 
). In the same month, the 
Supreme Court agreed to hear appeals to the lower court 
rulings about the constitutionality of the ACA, and ulti- 
mately ruled that the ACA was constitutional in June 2012. 
We examine how healthcare yields evolved relative to 
non-healthcare yields during the three-year period prior 
to the Supreme Court ruling, when some of the ACA le- 
gal uncertainties were resolved through the lower court 
rulings. In particular, we re-test the regression model in 
Eq. (1) with an extended sample period of June 2009 
(three months prior to the introduction of the ACA in the 
House of Representatives) to December 2013, and then 
graph the monthly βH 
t coeﬃcients. The time series of βH 
t 
coeﬃcients is reported in Fig. 3 
. Across the entire sam- 
ple period, we ﬁnd that healthcare yields ultimately de- 
creased by 25 bps. The graph indicates that 40% of this 
change (10 bps) occurred around the Supreme Court rul- 
ing, another 40% occurred around the D.C. Appeals Court 
ruling, and the remaining 20% (5 bps) occurred after the 
ACA was signed into law. 
7 Healthcare yields also decreased 
after favorable lower court rulings from the District Courts 
of Eastern Michigan and Western Virginia, but this change 
was largely offset by a subsequent District Court ruling in 
Florida that the ACA should be struck down entirely. Over- 
all, the evidence indicates that the Supreme Court ruling 
was the last in a series of resolutions of legal uncertainty 
surrounding the ACA. 
According to Fig. 3 
, the D.C. Appeals Court ruling also 
appears to have been instrumental in reducing healthcare 
yields, with an effect that is approximately equal to the 
Supreme Court effect. However, we focus on the Supreme 
7 The relatively small change after the ACA was signed into law sug- 
gests that there was still signiﬁcant uncertainty (and possible disagree- 
ment) about the ACA effect on hospital credit risk, especially given the 
almost immediate attempts to repeal the law through political and le- 
gal channels. The lack of change around March 2010 is consistent with a 
credit rating report from Moody’s stating that the outlook for US health- 
care had largely remained unchanged due to major uncertainties sur- 
rounding healthcare reform (e.g., Moody’s, 2011 
). The evidence is also 
consistent with Koijen et al. (2016) 
, who ﬁnd that the risk premium for 
healthcare equities was unaffected by the passage of the ACA in March 
2010. 
Court ruling throughout the remainder of this study for 
several reasons. The ﬁrst is that the Supreme Court rul- 
ing represents the ﬁnal resolution of legal uncertainty sur- 
rounding the constitutionality of the ACA. The second is 
that the Supreme Court ruling occurred much later than 
the previous lower court decisions, allowing us to achieve 
better identiﬁcation of the healthcare yield change after 
this particular ruling. The third is that the Supreme Court 
decided in the same case that the state-level Medicaid ex- 
pansion provision would be optional for states, allowing 
us to determine the effect of the ACA Medicaid expan- 
sion provision on healthcare yields in Medicaid expansion 
states relative to non-expansion states. 
We further illustrate the effect of the Supreme Court 
ruling on healthcare yields using a simple OLS regres- 
sion model. In particular, we test the following regres- 
sion model using the same sample period as our short-run 
event study in Fig. 2

where y is the secondary yield spread, PostSCR is an indi- 
cator variable that equals one if the municipal bond trans- 
action occurs after the Supreme Court ruling, and the re- 
maining variables are deﬁned as before. PostSCR will be 
used as a key independent variable in our regressions 
throughout this study. (Because some municipal bonds 
trade more frequently than others, we also inverse-weight 
each observation by the number of year-months in which 
the municipal bond appears in the sample; our results 
are similar if we do not apply this weighting procedure, 
however.) According to columns 1 and 2 of Table 3 
, Panel 
A, the PostSCR 
× Health point estimate is approximately 
−9.1 bps if we use all secondary transactions from Febru- 
ary 2012 to September 2012, and approximately −8.2 bps 
if we only focus on the transactions of seasoned bonds 
that were issued at least one year prior to the transaction. 
In the remaining columns, we extend our sample to June 
2015, three years after the Supreme Court ruling. Accord- 
ing to column 4 of Table 3 
, Panel A, for seasoned munic- 
ipal bonds, we ﬁnd that the average healthcare yield de- 
creases by about 20.1 bps during the three-year period fol- 
lowing the Supreme Court ruling. 
8 Therefore, the average 
yield on seasoned healthcare bonds immediately decreased 
by 8.2 bps after the Supreme Court ruling, and then an- 
other 11.9 bps over the next three years. The subsequent 
reduction is likely attributable to the staggered state-level 
votes in favor of Medicaid expansion, which the Supreme 
Court ruled was optional in June 2012, over this three-year 
period. In the next section, we expand on this point by 
testing the effect of Medicaid expansion on local health- 
care municipal bond yields in a multivariate regression set- 
ting. The staggered expansion of Medicaid across differ- 
8 For the long-run regressions, we double-cluster the standard errors 
by state and year-month because there is a suﬃcient number of year- 
month clusters in the long-run sample. Our results remain robust if we 
single-cluster or double-cluster the standard errors based on the county 
of issuance, issuer, state, or year-month. Our results also remain robust 
if we cluster the standard errors based on the Health indicator variable 
using the wild bootstrap procedure from Cameron et al. (2008) 
.

ent states, in addition to the non-expansion of Medicaid in 
other states, is useful for further identifying the ACA effect 
on healthcare yields. 
An alternative approach for testing the effect of PostSCR 
on healthcare versus non-healthcare secondary yields is to 
match each healthcare bond that trades in the pre-SCR pe- 
riod to a non-healthcare bond with similar characteristics 
that also trades in the pre-SCR period. We can then test 
whether there is a divergence in yields between the treat- 
ment and matched control groups following the Supreme 
Court ruling. The main advantage of this approach is that 
we do not have to control for ﬁxed or time-varying yield 
covariates around the Supreme Court ruling, which is espe- 
cially important given the underlying differences in char- 
acteristics between healthcare and non-healthcare bonds, 
such as credit quality and size. We focus only on bonds 
that trade in both the three-month pre-SCR window and 
the three-month post-SCR window. If there are multiple 
bond-level observations in one of the windows, then we 
choose the observation that is closest to the Supreme 
Court decision. Then, we exact-match each pre-SCR health- 
care bond observation to a pre-SCR non-healthcare bond 
observation based on the state of issuance, GO indica- 
tor, and insured indicator. We also nearest-neighbor match 
based on the credit rating, bond size, and time to matu- 
rity. This is similar in spirit to the corporate bond match- 
ing procedure in Bessembinder et al. (2009) 
. After match- 
ing, we then test if the average yield difference between 
healthcare and non-healthcare bonds in the post-SCR pe- 
riod is statistically signiﬁcant from the average yield dif- 
ference in the pre-SCR period. 
The average relative yield differences are reported in 
Panel B of Table 3 
. Similar to our previous graphical and 
regression results, we ﬁnd that healthcare yields signiﬁ- 
cantly decrease relative to non-healthcare yields after the 
Supreme Court ruling. In particular, we ﬁnd that the av- 
erage healthcare yield spread is approximately 24.6 bps 
higher than the average non-healthcare yield spread dur- 
ing the pre-SCR period. However, following the Supreme 
Court ruling, the average yield difference decreases by a 
statistically signiﬁcant 6.7 bps ( 
p 
= 
0 
. 
011 
), for a post-SCR 
average yield difference of 17.9 bps, or 27.2% of the pre-SCR 
average yield difference. Therefore, our results further con- 
ﬁrm that the ACA Supreme Court ruling signiﬁcantly im- 
proved hospital credit quality. 
We also examine the PostSCR effect on healthcare of- 
fering yields to determine if the Supreme Court ruling led 
to real interest savings for new issuances in the health- 
care sector. In particular, we re-test the previous regres- 
sion model in Eq. (2) 
, with y deﬁned as the offering yield 
spread and PostSCR deﬁned as an indicator variable that 
equals one if the municipal bond was issued after the 
Supreme Court decision. Because the number of municipal 
bond primary issuances is much smaller than the number 
of municipal bond secondary transactions, we extend the 
beginning and end of the sample period for the regression 
to January 2011 and June 2015, respectively. The sample 
period is similar to the one used for the previous long- 
run secondary yield regressions, except that we also use 
a longer pre-SCR window to allow for more unique munic- 
ipal bond issuances before the Supreme Court ruling.

The results of our offering yield tests are reported 
in Table 4 
. The results in column 1 indicate that the 
PostSCR effect on the offering yield spread is approximately 
−13.6 bps. The results in the remaining columns indicate 
that the offering yield results are robust to alternative 
speciﬁcations. Next, we focus on raw offering yields and 
include the coupon-equivalent risk-free yield as an inde- 
pendent variable ( 
T 
Y 
ield) in the regression. The results in 
column 2 indicate a similar PostSCR effect of −13.8 bps. 
Next, we use the tax-adjusted offering yield spread as the 
dependent variable. In particular, we divide the offering 
yield by one minus the top marginal federal tax rate and 
state tax rate in the state of issuance, and then subtract 
the coupon-equivalent risk-free yield. (The offering yield 
is not adjusted for state taxes if the municipal bond was 
issued in Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Oklahoma, or Wisconsin, 
as these states tax interest income on municipal bonds is- 
sued in-state or out-of-state.) The results in column 3 in- 
dicate that the PostSCR effect on the tax-adjusted health- 
care offering yield spread is −22.3 bps. The larger effect 
is fairly expected since the offering yield is scaled up by 
the tax adjustment. Finally, we adjust the municipal bond 
offering yield spread for any embedded call options using 
the methodology in Novy-Marx and Rauh (2012) 
, which in 
turn is based on the Black (1976) model for pricing options 
on futures. In column 4, we ﬁnd that the PostSCR effect is 
again similar at approximately −11.7 bps.

9 In Internet Appendix A, we show that the average credit rating of 
healthcare bonds issued after the Supreme Court ruling is 0.17 notches 
lower than seasoned healthcare bonds that trade after the ruling. This 
evidence suggests that some marginal risky healthcare issuers entered 
the PostSCR sample. Further, we ﬁnd that the average credit rating does 
not change in counties with poor ﬁscal conditions, which is consistent

4.2. Identiﬁcation using cross-state medicaid expansion 
Our baseline results rely on changes in the average 
yield for healthcare versus non-healthcare bonds around a 
single event date. Identiﬁcation may be an issue if some 
other unobservable event around June 2012 affected yields 
on healthcare bonds. To address this issue, we analyze 
the differential change in healthcare yields for states that 
voted to expand Medicaid as part of the ACA versus the 
states that did not. Many states also voted to expand Med- 
icaid at different times during our sample period. New 
York, for example, approved the expansion of Medicaid in 
mid-2012, while Indiana approved in early 2015. Thus, we 
can exploit both cross-sectional and time series variation 
in the state-level Medicaid expansion decision. 
Ex ante, the effect of Medicaid expansion on healthcare 
yields is unclear. On the one hand, hospitals have beneﬁted 
from the increase in the arrival rate of insured patients 
and the associated decrease in the costly uncompensated 
care burden. In the top panel of Fig. 4 
, we graph the time 
series evolution of insurance rates in the Medicaid expan- 
sion states and show that the insured rate signiﬁcantly in- 
creased around the implementation of the ACA. In particu- 
lar, the Medicaid-insured rate increases from 16.1% in 2009 
to 21.5% in 2017, a difference of 5.4 percentage points. The 
largest increase occurs in 2014 (1.9%), the year that most 
of the ACA provisions, including the subsidies for state- 
level Medicaid expansion, went into effect. We also ﬁnd 
a similar decrease in the uninsured rate during this pe- 
riod. By contrast, according to the bottom panel of Fig. 4 
, 
the Medicaid-insured rate in non-expansion states only in- 
creases by 1.9 percentage points from 2009 to 2017, with 
almost no change occurring in the ACA implementation 
year of 2014. Therefore, our graphs indicate that Medicaid 
expansion states experience larger increases in the rate of 
insured patients around the implementation of the ACA. 
On the other hand, one major downside of the state- 
level expansion of Medicaid is that the additional Medicaid 
costs borne by the state may be offset by state-level cuts 
to hospital reimbursement rates. From 2020 onward, Medi- 
caid expansion states are responsible for 10% of the cost of 
Medicaid expansion, with the federal government covering 
the remaining 90%. Many states have rejected the option to 
expand Medicaid because they were already overburdened 
with increasingly high Medicaid costs ( 
Leonard, 2015 
). In- 
deed, studies show that Medicaid expenditures increase 
from about 12% of state revenue in 20 
0 
0 to 17% of state 
revenue in 2017 ( 
Pew Charitable Trusts, 2020 
; Yi, 2021 
). 
Other studies show that Medicaid reimbursement short- 
falls to hospitals steadily increase over time, and that the 
gap between private insurance payments and Medicaid 
insurance payments has steadily widened ( 
Selden et al., 
2015; Young et al., 2019 
), suggesting that states continue to 
offset the increasing costs of Medicaid enrollment. There- 
with the evidence in Ivanov and Zimmerman (2021) that marginal risky 
healthcare issuers exited the municipal bond market and turned to pri- 
vate bank borrowing. However, the self-selection of marginal healthcare 
issuers into the PostSCR sample only increases the average healthcare 
yield by a statistically insigniﬁcant 2.2 bps ( 
t 
= 
1 
. 
05 
), suggesting that our 
main results are not inﬂuenced by this self-selection bias. 
fore, from a credit risk perspective, hospitals may be worse 
off if Medicaid reimbursement rates suﬃciently decrease in 
response to the expanded Medicaid eligibility threshold. 
We jointly test the effects of the Supreme Court ruling 
in June 2012 and the state-level decisions to expand Med- 
icaid on offering yield spreads from January 2011 to June 
2015. In particular, we test the following OLS regression 
model: 
y 
it = βMH · P

, 
(3) 
where PostMed ( 
P 
reMed) is an indicator variable that 
equals one if the municipal bond was issued after (before) 
its state voted to expand Medicaid, and all other variables 
are deﬁned as before. A beneﬁt of this approach is that we 
can jointly observe the effect of the Supreme Court deci- 
sion in June 2012 ( 
βPH 
) and the incremental effect of the 
state-level decision to expand Medicaid ( 
βMH 
). 
The results of this test are reported in column 1 of 
Table 5 
. Our ﬁrst observation is that the PostSCR effect 
on healthcare yields is about −9.8 bps, indicating that the 
combination of non-Medicaid ACA provisions and forward- 
looking expectations of state-level Medicaid expansions are 
instrumental in reducing healthcare yields. More impor- 
tantly, our second observation is that the PostMed effect 
on healthcare yields relative to non-healthcare yields is a 
highly signiﬁcant −13.0 bps. 
10 Thus, the overall ACA effect 
on healthcare offering yields in Medicaid expansion states 
is about −22.8 bps, which is just over twice as large as the 
overall ACA effect in the non-expansion states. The incre- 
mental effect in the Medicaid expansion states corresponds 
to additional aggregate present-value interest savings of 
about 13.0 bps × $24 billion × 8 years = $250 million 
for healthcare municipal bonds issued in Medicaid expan- 
sion states during the post-expansion period, where $24 
billion is the total issuance amount and 8 years is the av- 
erage duration of these bonds. This evidence suggests that 
the ACA signiﬁcantly improved the credit quality outlook 
of healthcare municipal bonds issued in Medicaid expan- 
sion states. Studies show that low-income households in 
Medicaid expansion states are less likely to default on rent 
and mortgage payments after they qualiﬁed for Medicaid 
due to a state-level expansion of Medicaid ( 
Gallagher et al., 
2019 
). Furthermore, low-income households experiencing 
ﬁnancial hardships are more likely to increase their savings 
rates and repay outstanding debts ( 
Gallagher et al., 2020 
). 
Our results suggest that the improvements in credit quality 
for low-income households due to Medicaid expansion had 
10 In

Appendix

we

that 
non-healthcare

yields were not affected by the PostSCR or PostMed events. In particu- 
lar, we show that the average non-healthcare municipal bond yield re- 
mains unchanged relative to the default risk premium implied by the 
state-level credit default swap spread. Therefore, non-healthcare munic- 
ipal bond yields provide a suitable benchmark for evaluating the treat- 
ment 
effects 
of 
PostSCR 
and 
PostMed on

yields. 
This evidence also suggests that the Medicaid cost burden on state bud- 
gets (a common reason for rejecting Medicaid expansion in the non- 
expansion states) did not materially affect default risk for non-healthcare 
municipal bonds.

positive spillover effects to public and non-proﬁt hospitals 
in the form of lower hospital credit risk. 
It is possible that the PostMed 
× Health results in col- 
umn 1 can be explained by a downward trend in health- 
care yields between the Supreme Court decision in mid- 
2012 and the state-level Medicaid expansion decisions, 
many of which occurred at some point in 2013. A post- 
SCR downward trend is possible if investors continued to 
adjust to new ACA-relevant information during that period. 
To account for the potential trend in healthcare yields dur- 
ing this interim period, we re-test the previous regression 
model with separate year-month ﬁxed effects for health- 
care bonds ( 
δt×h 
) and non-healthcare bonds ( 
δt×nh 
). (We 
also exclude PostSCR 
× Health and Health because these 
variables are absorbed by the ﬁxed effects.) The results of 
this regression are reported in column 2 of Table 5 
. We 
ﬁnd that healthcare offering yields decrease by 8.8 bps af- 
ter the state votes to expand Medicaid. The 8.8 bps ef- 
fect is slightly weaker than the 13.0 bps effect reported in 
column 1, suggesting that pre-expansion trends in health- 
care yields partially explain the initial results. However, 
the 8.8 bps effect is economically signiﬁcant and further 
suggests that Medicaid expansion reduced hospital credit 
risk.

Another possibility is that our results are inﬂuenced 
by potential endogeneity in the state-level decision to 
expand Medicaid. Oﬃcials from North Carolina, for ex- 
ample, argued against expanding Medicaid because the 
state was already overburdened with high Medicaid costs 
( 
Leonard, 2015 
). On the other hand, studies show that 
most of the non-expansion decisions were driven by po- 
litical considerations, which are independent of municipal 
bond yields ( 
Badger, 2013; Pew Charitable Trusts, 2015 
; Yi, 
2021 
). To address this potential endogeneity issue, we ex- 
amine healthcare municipal bond yields in states that im- 
mediately expanded Medicaid versus the states that later 
expanded Medicaid during our sample period. The late- 
expansion states had similar concerns about expanding 
Medicaid and thus provide an approximation of the treat- 
ment effect that would occur in the non-expansion states. 
We re-test the previous regression model with the inclu- 
sion of the following interaction variables: Late 
× PostMed, 
where Late is an indicator variable that equals one if the 
state expanded Medicaid after January 2014, and Late 
×
PostMed 
× Health 
. The results are reported in column 3 of 
Table 5 
. We ﬁnd that the average healthcare yield change 
in late-expansion states is not signiﬁcantly different from 
the change in early-expansion states. Therefore, our results 
suggest that endogeneity in the Medicaid expansion de- 
cision is unlikely to be a signiﬁcant determinant of post- 
expansion healthcare yield changes. Furthermore, the com- 
parable yield beneﬁts for the late-expansion states suggest 
that the concerns about the Medicaid cost burden may 
have been overstated, especially in light of the reduction in 
uncompensated care costs for hospitals, and the lack of any 
detrimental PostMed yield effects for non-healthcare mu- 
nicipal bonds in Internet Appendix B. 
Finally, we test the PostMed effect on the secondary 
yields of seasoned municipal bonds. We ﬁnd in column 4 
that the average healthcare secondary yield is signiﬁcantly 
lower in the post-expansion period relative to the pre- 
expansion period ( 
−8.3 bps), which is consistent with the 
results in the previous columns. We also ﬁnd evidence of 
a lower average healthcare yield during the pre-expansion 
period, suggesting that healthcare bonds on the secondary 
market traded at higher prices as the probability of a fa- 
vorable Medicaid-expansion vote converged to one. Our re- 
sults for the secondary market also indicate that the post- 
expansion decrease in healthcare yields is not attributable 
to potential endogeneity in the timing of higher-quality is- 
suances, as most of these bonds were issued well before 
the expansion vote. Overall, our results suggest that the 
expansion of Medicaid was highly important for reducing 
healthcare yields and improving hospital credit risk in the 
Medicaid expansion states. 
4.3. The real effects underlying hospital credit risk 
Our evidence indicates that the ACA reduced health- 
care municipal bond yields through the hospital credit risk 
channel. Our proposed mechanism is that the positive de- 
mand effect from newly-insured patients outweighs the 
negative supply effect stemming from anticipated hospi- 
tal reimbursement cuts by the federal and state govern- 
ments. In this section, we provide further evidence to sup- 
port this mechanism by showing how the ACA affected 
real hospital outcomes. Using data from HCUP, particularly 
the HCUP State Emergency Department and State Inpatient 
databases, we analyze the makeup of hospital payer types 
who are admitted to the hospital for urgent emergency

room (ER) procedures or longer-term inpatient procedures 
that require hospitalization for at least one night. From a 
credit risk perspective, the separation of procedures is im- 
portant because hospitals are generally required to admit 
patients who require costly emergency care, regardless of 
their insurance status. 
We ﬁrst examine ER patient statistics across all Medi- 
caid expansion states, where pre-2014 uninsured residents 
were more likely to qualify for Medicaid after the im- 
plementation of the ACA in January of that year. As in 
Table 2 
, we deﬁne Medicaid expansion states as the states 
that voted to expand Medicaid before the ACA implemen- 
tation date of January 2014. 
11 For each year-quarter from 
2009 to 2017, we separately calculate the total number of 
admitted ER patients who are Medicaid-insured, privately 
insured, or uninsured. The results are reported graphi- 
cally in the top-left panel of Fig. 5 and numerically in the 
11 Twenty-seven states did not report inpatient and ER data for the 
HCUP database across the 2009–2017 sample period. The following 12 
Medicaid expansion states provided inpatient and ER data during this 
period: Arizona, California, Iowa, Illinois, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Mary- 
land, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, and Vermont. The 
following 11 non-expansion states provided inpatient and ER data during 
top panel of Table 6 
. We ﬁnd that the time series aver- 
age number of uninsured ER patients decreases by about 
0.57 million residents after January 2014, while the av- 
erage number of Medicaid-insured ER patients increases 
by about 1.12 million residents. The number of privately- 
insured ER patients, however, remains about the same. The 
asymmetric change for uninsured and Medicaid-insured ER 
patients corroborates evidence in Garthwaite et al. (2017) 
, 
Nikpay et al. (2017) 
, and Duggan et al. (2020) 
, and suggests 
that some residents were more likely to use ER services af- 
ter becoming Medicaid-insured. We also ﬁnd that the per- 
centage of ER patients who are uninsured decreased from 
25% to 13% after January 2014, for a statistically signiﬁcant 
change of −12 percentage points. By contrast, according to 
the top-right panel of Fig. 5 and second panel of Table 6 
, 
the number of longer-term inpatient procedures for unin- 
sured patients and Medicaid-insured patients are relatively 
unaffected. Overall, our evidence suggests that the ACA- 
induced reduction in hospital credit risk for Medicaid ex- 
pansion states is strongly associated with an increase in ER 
this period: Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Missouri, North Carolina, Nebraska, 
South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, and Wisconsin.

Next, we examine ER patient statistics for non- 
expansion states, where residents continued to face the 
same income thresholds to qualify for Medicaid. We deﬁne 
non-expansion states as those states that did not vote to 
expand Medicaid by the end of 2017. Similar to the Med- 
icaid expansion states, for each year-quarter from 2009 to 
2017, we separately calculate the total number of admitted 
ER patients who are Medicaid-insured, privately insured, 
or uninsured. In the bottom-left panel of Fig. 5 and third 
panel of Table 6 
, we show that there is a signiﬁcant in- 
crease in ER usage by privately-insured residents. This ev- 
idence suggests that residents in these states were more 
likely to purchase subsidized private insurance on ACA ex- 
changes because Medicaid subsidies were still not an op- 
tion. The small decrease in uninsured ER usage further 
suggests that many uninsured residents avoided using ER 
services until they became privately-insured through ACA 
exchanges. Altogether, we ﬁnd that there is a ﬁve per- 
centage point decrease in uninsured ER visits after Jan- 
uary 2014, which is economically signiﬁcant although not 
as large as the 12 percentage point decrease for Medi- 
caid expansion states. Finally, in the bottom-right panel of 
Fig. 5 and fourth panel of Table 6 
, we show that there 
are no economically signiﬁcant changes in longer-term in- 
patient visits in the non-expansion states. Overall, our 
evidence suggests that the PostSCR reduction in hospital 
credit risk in non-expansion states is more associated with 
an increase in privately-insured ER visits. However, given 
that several states voted to expand Medicaid after January 
2014, it is likely that the PostSCR reduction in hospital 
credit risk in non-expansion states is also partially due to 
forward-looking expectations about an eventual vote to ex- 
pand Medicaid. 
5. The ACA and real investment spending 
Our baseline results indicate that the ACA improved 
overall hospital credit risk, even with the additional policy 
uncertainty surrounding Medicaid reimbursement rates. In 
light of the competing effects associated with the ACA, 
another important question arises: How did the ACA af- 
fect the real investment spending of hospitals? Accord- 
ing to standard Q-theory, investment spending should not 
respond to cash ﬂow shocks in a frictionless market. 
However, investment spending may respond to cash ﬂow 
shocks in the presence of ﬁnancial constraints or agency 
costs, the two most common explanations for investment- 
cash ﬂow sensitivities ( 
Stein, 2003 
). In the non-proﬁt hos- 
pital setting, Adelino et al. (2015) provide strong evidence 
that investment-cash ﬂow sensitivities are primarily at- 
tributable to ﬁnancial constraints. If the ACA relaxed ﬁ- 
nancial constraints, as our baseline results suggest, then 
we would expect investment spending to increase and the 
sensitivity of investment spending to cash ﬂow shocks to 
decrease. However, if ACA-associated uncertainties are suf- 
ﬁciently large, then real investment spending may remain 
unaffected. 
We 
closely 
follow 
the 
methodology 
in 
Adelino et al. (2015) to test how investment spending 
and investment-cash ﬂow sensitivities have changed since

the implementation of the ACA. First, we collect ﬁnan- 
cial statement information for each hospital h from the 
HCRIS database for the years 2010 to 2018. The dependent 
variables used in our analyses of investment spending 
and investment-cash ﬂow sensitivities are future one-year 
and two-year growth in net ﬁxed assets, g(NF

) 
h,t+1 and 
g(NF

) 
h,t+2 
. The main independent variables are PostImp

statement information was released after the ACA was 
implemented in 2014, and “Investment Income” (

dowment fund in year t to net ﬁxed assets in year t −1 
, 
and I 
n 
v 
I

h,t × PostI

t 
. Identifying the effect of cash 
ﬂow shocks on investment spending is challenging be- 
cause the shocks are often correlated with the investment 
opportunity set ( 
Bakke and Whited, 2012 
). Cash ﬂow 
shocks from the hospital’s endowment fund are useful for 
identiﬁcation purposes because they are unlikely to be 
correlated with the hospital’s investment opportunity set, 
as opposed to cash ﬂow shocks from the hospital’s opera- 
tions ( 
Adelino et al., 2015 
). We then test the following OLS 
regression model:

, δh is a vector of hospital ﬁxed effects, 
and Y is a vector of hospital-level control variables from 
Adelino et al. (2015) that includes the following: the value 
of the hospital’s ﬁnancial investments scaled by net ﬁxed 
assets in t −1 (

from t −1 to t (

by net ﬁxed assets in year t −1 ( 
OpInc); and the natu- 
ral logarithm of total revenue in year t ( 
log(T

v 
) 
). As in 
Adelino et al. (2015) 
, we also apply the following ﬁlters 
to our HCRIS data. First, we require each hospital to have 
at least $1 million in assets and service revenue. Second, 
we require each hospital to have some investment securi- 
ties, and to have reported valid information on investment 
income. Third, we control for extreme outliers by trun- 
cating observations in the top or bottom 1% of the sam- 
ple distribution for the following variables: I

the ratio of investment income to lagged value of ﬁnan- 
cial investments, operating income, revenue, and revenue 
growth. For convenience, we provide summary statistics on 
all of the hospital ﬁnancial variables in Table 7 
; we gener- 
ally ﬁnd that the distributions of these variables are sim- 
ilar to the distributions reported in Adelino et al. (2015) 
. 
The β1 coeﬃcient measures hospital investment-cash ﬂow 
sensitivity before the ACA was implemented, the β2 coeﬃ- 
cient measures the change in sensitivity relative to the pre- 
implementation period, and the β3 coeﬃcient measures 
how hospital investment spending was directly affected by 
the ACA.

ing that it spurred hospital investment growth. We re-test 
the same regression model with hospital and year ﬁxed

one-year ﬁxed asset growth responds to cash ﬂow shocks 
before the ACA, and no statistically signiﬁcant evidence 
that investment spending or investment sensitivities over 
a one-year horizon change after the implementation of 
the ACA, although the signs of the point estimates are the 
same as those reported for the two-year horizon. 
12 Over- 
all, the evidence of weaker investment sensitivities and 
stronger investment spending following the implementa- 
tion of the ACA, particularly over a two-year investment 
horizon, supports our main results showing that the ACA 
improved hospital credit quality and thus relaxed ﬁnancial 
constraints, even with the increased policy uncertainty. 
Our evidence is also externally consistent with a recent 
report by Standard & Poor’s showing that ﬁnancial con- 
straints for non-proﬁt hospitals signiﬁcantly relaxed after

the implementation of the ACA ( 
Standard & Poor’s, 2018 
). 
In particular, the S&P report shows that the hospital’s debt 
burden, deﬁned as the ratio of annual debt expense to to- 
tal revenue, decreased from about 2.7% during the pre- 
2014 period to 2.3% during the post-2014 period, repre- 
senting a 15% decrease in the average debt burden. Sim- 
ilarly, the hospital’s cushion ratio, deﬁned as the ratio of 
the hospital’s cash level to the annual debt expense, in- 
creased from about 17 in the pre-2014 period to 21 in 
the post-2014 period, representing a 24% increase in the 
average cushion ratio. Finally, the report shows that the 
hospital’s unrestricted reserves as a percentage of long- 
term debt increased from about 135% in the pre-2014 pe- 
riod to 165% in the post-2014 period, representing an in- 
crease of about 22%. Together, these statistics provide a 
useful overview of a hospital’s ability to service its debt. 
Overall, the S&P statistics support our overall evidence that 
the ACA weakened investment-cash ﬂow sensitivities and 
spurred real investment growth by relaxing hospital ﬁnan- 
cial constraints. 
6. Cross-sectional variation in ACA yield changes 
In this section, we provide further insight into the 
mechanism underlying the ACA-associated changes in 
healthcare municipal bond yields by exploiting cross- 
sectional differences in counties and bond attributes. In 
particular, we focus on the ACA-associated yield effects for 
healthcare municipal bonds issued in urban versus rural 
counties, in high-DSH versus low-DSH counties, and with 
long versus short maturities. 
6.1. ACA effects for urban versus rural counties 
Our baseline results suggest that the increased de- 
mand for medical care generated by ACA subsidies re- 
duces hospital credit risk, even with the cuts to hospital 
reimbursement rates. In this section, we analyze demand- 
driven variation in hospital credit risk by focusing on hos- 
pitals in urban and rural counties. Pre-ACA studies doc- 
ument the challenges in expanding medical access and 
decreasing uninsured rates in rural areas. For example, 
Biles et al. (2004) show that the Medicare+Choice pro- 
gram, introduced in 1997 to provide better access to Medi- 
care through the private insurance market, did not af- 
fect Medicare coverage in the vast majority of rural ar- 
eas. Gold (2008) shows that the establishment of network- 
based plans for the Medicare Advantage program, an up- 
dated version of the Medicare+Choice program, was still 
relatively intractable in rural areas due to low population 
density and a small number of insurance providers. Pri- 
vate insurers are also less likely to compete in rural ar- 
eas, even with Medicare or Medicaid support, because ru- 
ral populations tend to be older and sicker, and are gener- 
ally not large enough to spread risk for insurance providers 
( 
Berkes, 2009 
). Prior to the implementation of the ACA, ru- 
ral healthcare providers and municipal issuers expressed 
concern that the ACA-associated private insurance beneﬁts 
(however modest in rural areas due to a lack of insurance 
competition to sell subsidized insurance) would not be suf- 
ﬁcient to offset the ACA-associated cuts to Medicare. For 
example, a hospital district in rural Abeline, Kansas notes 
in its “Risk Factors and Investment Considerations” sec- 
tion, particularly in its discussion of the regulatory risks 
surrounding the ACA, that “it is unlikely that the hospi-

Fig. 6. Evolution of healthcare versus non-healthcare yield spreads in urban areas around ACA Supreme Court decision in June 2012. This graph shows 
the point estimates and 95% conﬁdence intervals for the effect of the ACA Supreme Court ruling on healthcare municipal bonds (treatment) relative to 
non-healthcare municipal bonds (control). The point estimates are obtained from a regression of secondary yield spread on Health

tal district could attract suﬃcient numbers of private pay 
patients to become self-suﬃcient without reimbursements 
under the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Thus, future 
reimbursement from government sources will be critically 
important to hospitals generally and to the hospital dis- 
trict speciﬁcally, and reductions in reimbursements in the 
future could have a material adverse effect on the hospital 
district and its results of operations.” The prospectus fur- 
ther notes that “the impact of ACA on the operations of 
the hospital district cannot be currently ascertained, and 
it may have a material impact, either positive or negative, 
on the hospital district’s operations” ( 
Municipal Securities 
Rulemaking Board, 2011 
; pg. 15). Therefore, in light of pre- 
vious evidence, the ACA effect on hospital credit risk may 
be weaker in rural areas due to a lack of insurance ﬁrm 
competition. 
We ﬁrst provide visual evidence of the yield changes 
around the Supreme Court decision in rural versus urban 
counties. In particular, we construct separate event study 
graphs around the ACA Supreme Court decision for urban 
versus rural counties using the regression model in Eq. (1) 
. 
In Fig. 6 
, we graph the βH 
t coeﬃcients around the Supreme 
Court ruling for healthcare bonds issued in urban counties. 
Similar to our baseline results, we ﬁnd that urban health- 
care yields decrease by a statistically signiﬁcant 8 bps im- 
mediately following the Supreme Court decision. By con- 
trast, in Fig. 7 
, we graph the βH 
t coeﬃcients around the 
Supreme Court ruling for healthcare bonds issued in rural 
counties and ﬁnd no statistically signiﬁcant yield change in 
the post-SCR period. Our evidence is consistent with the 
anticipated weaker demand effects in rural areas. 
We also test the PostSCR effect on healthcare yields 
in urban and rural areas using the regression model in 
Eq. (2) and ﬁnd similar results over the three-year post- 
SCR period. First, we focus on offering yields from urban 
counties from January 2011 to June 2015. We ﬁnd in col- 
umn 1 of Table 9 that the average urban healthcare of- 
fering yield decreases by 14.6 bps. Next, we focus on of- 
fering yields from rural counties. The regression results in 
column 3 indicate that there is no statistically signiﬁcant 
evidence that the average rural healthcare offering yield 
changes after the Supreme Court ruling. We also jointly 
test the PostSCR and state-level Medicaid expansion effects 
( 
PostMed) on urban and rural healthcare yields. Unlike the 
private insurance subsidies, the Medicaid insurance sub- 
sidies may be more material for reducing rural hospital 
credit risk because rural residents tend to be poorer and 
thus stand to beneﬁt more from fully subsidized insur- 
ance. Furthermore, the lack of private insurance competi- 
tion in rural areas should not inhibit access to Medicaid 
insurance ( 
Gold, 2008; Berkes, 2009 
). We show in column 
2 that the PostSCR and PostMed effects in urban areas are 
−11.0 bps and −10.2 bps, respectively. Hence, the Supreme 
Court ruling and Medicaid expansion decision contribute 
about equally to the reduction in healthcare yields in ur- 
ban areas. Finally, we show in column 4 that there is no 
statistically signiﬁcant PostSCR effect in rural areas. How- 
ever, we do ﬁnd a weakly signiﬁcant PostMed effect of 
−23.3 bps ( 
t = −1 
. 
85 
) in these areas. (We also obtain simi- 
lar results if we test a pooled regression model with triple- 
interaction terms and the Rural indicator variable.) Overall, 
our evidence suggests that the expansion of the income 
threshold for Medicaid eligibility is important for reducing 
rural hospital credit risk. 
Our results indicate that the ACA is particularly beneﬁ- 
cial to hospitals located in urban counties, where compe- 
tition to provide cheaper insurance packages on the ACA 
exchanges is greater. Our results are also consistent with 
ex post evidence from the Urban Institute that residents 
in rural counties are less likely to beneﬁt from the sub- 
sidies to purchase private insurance on ACA exchanges 
due to a lack of insurance competition in those coun-

ties ( 
Wengle et al., 2018 
). Households with an income be- 
tween 100% and 400% of the federal poverty line are eli- 
gible to receive subsidies for private health insurance pur- 
chased on ACA exchanges. However, due to a lack of in- 
surance ﬁrm competition in rural areas, insurance premi- 
ums are approximately 10% higher in rural counties, with 
signiﬁcant variation across states. In Colorado, for exam- 
ple, monthly insurance premiums in rural areas ($402) are 
about 43% higher than those in urban areas ($282) in 2016 
( 
Wengle et al., 2018 
). As a result, many rural residents 
purchased cheaper insurance packages with lower premi- 
ums and higher deductibles, typically denoted as “bronze 
plans,” on ACA exchanges. The Urban Institute report also 
indicates that hospitals continued to provide high rates of 
uncompensated care in rural counties, even after the ACA 
went into effect, because rural residents could not afford to 
pay the high deductibles. 
13 The lack of yield change around 
the Supreme Court decision suggests that the municipal 
bond market anticipated the weaker private insurance de- 
mand effects in rural areas. 
13 In addition, insured patients requiring emergency care in rural areas 
are 
typically 
stabilized 
at 
a 
rural 
hospital 
and 
then 
transported 
to 
a 
larger 
urban facility. The bills at the urban facility are often completely covered 
by 
the 
patient’s 
insurance 
because 
the 
patient 
meets 
the 
deductible 
at 
the 
rural hospital. Thus, rural hospitals are more exposed to the risk that the 
patient defaults on the deductible payment ( 
Johnson, 2017 
). These sol- 
vency issues for rural hospitals are also exacerbated by the increasing 
use of telehealth appointments with urban hospitals by rural residents, 
particularly in the majority of states that now require equivalent patient 
reimbursements for in-person and telehealth services ( 
Cornaggia et al., 
2021b 
).

6.2. ACA effects for high-DSH versus low-DSH counties 
In this section, we analyze supply-driven variation in 
hospital credit risk by focusing on hospitals in high-DSH 
versus low-DSH counties. Hospitals in high-DSH counties 
serve a disproportionate number of uninsured patients, 
and thus receive subsidy payments from the Centers for 
Medicaid and Medicare Services (CMS) to cover the high 
costs of uncompensated care. The ACA has scheduled over 
$40 billion in cuts to DSH subsidies, with the reason- 
ing that hospitals would care for fewer uninsured patients 
as health coverage expands. Prior to the ACA Supreme 
Court decision, hospital executives in high-DSH counties 
expressed concern about the viability of their business 
model after the implementation of these cuts, even with 
the supposed expansion of health insurance coverage. For 
example, CEO Mark Moran of Metrohealth Medical Center, 
a hospital in Cleveland, Ohio that received high DSH sub- 
sidies to cover the costs of uncompensated care, stated in 
2011 that the ACA federal healthcare reform is a “freight 
train headed right for us” due to the anticipated DSH 
payment cuts ( 
Glenn, 2011 
). DSH hospital CEO Arthur Gi- 
anelli further stated in early 2012 that “no matter how 
the Supreme Court rules on the law, payment changes in 
the health care system will not stop, and thus will leave 
already undercapitalized public hospitals with even less 
money to develop alternatives” ( 
Bristol, 2012 
). Finally, Deb- 
orah Bachrach, special counsel for Manatt Health Solutions, 
expressed concern about the declining DSH payments, stat- 
ing that “the DSH cut is premised on the success of the 
health overhaul. Policymakers need to ensure that DSH 
funding is adequate to cover the cost of services to the 
remaining uninsured” ( 
Bristol, 2012 
). In a related study, 
Neuhausen et al. (2014) project that the ACA-associated 
decrease in uncompensated care costs may not match the 
scheduled DSH reductions due to the high number of peo- 
ple who will remain uninsured. They estimate that total 
DSH costs in California would increase from $2.0 billion 
in 2010 to approximately $2.4 billion in 2019, with unmet 
DSH costs of $1.5 billion. Therefore, the effect of the ACA 
on hospital credit risk in high-DSH counties is more am- 
biguous due to the large anticipated cuts to DSH subsidies. 
Formally, we separately test the P 
ostSCR and P 
ostMed
effects on high-DSH versus low-DSH counties in an OLS re- 
gression setting. To determine whether a county is high- 
DSH or low-DSH, we obtain county-level total DSH pay- 
ment data from Medicaid.gov, a federal government web- 
site managed by CMS. For each county, we then calculate 
the DSH ratio as the ratio of the county-level pre-ACA total 
DSH payment to the number of uninsured residents who 
are below 65 years of age and 138% of the poverty line. 
If the county-level ratio is above its median value for the 
state, then the county is deﬁned as “high-DSH.” Otherwise, 
the county is deﬁned as “low-DSH.” Across all counties, 
the mean DSH ratio is $930, and the median DSH ratio is 
$400. In columns 1 and 2 of Table 10 
, we focus on high- 
DSH counties. We ﬁrst test the PostSCR effect on healthcare 
offering yields in high-DSH counties, and ﬁnd a weakly 
signiﬁcant PostSCR effect of −11.4 bps ( 
t = −1 
. 
89 
) in col- 
umn 1. However, when we jointly test the PostSCR and 
PostMed effects on healthcare offering yields in high-DSH 
counties, we ﬁnd in column 2 that the PostSCR effect is sta- 
tistically insigniﬁcant ( 
t = −1 
. 
13 
), while the PostMed effect 
is a statistically signiﬁcant −13.6 bps ( 
t = −2 
. 
24 
). These 
results suggest that the anticipated increase in privately- 
insured patients would not be enough to offset the antic- 
ipated DSH cuts, but the additional increase in Medicaid- 
insured patients would be suﬃcient to offset the DSH cuts 
and reduce hospital credit risk. Finally, in columns 3 and 4, 
we ﬁnd that PostSCR and PostMed contribute about equally 
to a reduction in healthcare yields in low-DSH counties, 
with a PostSCR effect of −11.5 bps and a PostMed effect of 
−11.9 bps. Therefore, the anticipated increases in the pri- 
vate insurance rate and Medicaid insurance rate were im- 
portant for reducing hospital credit risk in low-DSH coun- 
ties, which were less exposed to DSH cuts. Overall, our ev- 
idence suggests that Medicaid-expansion was particularly 
important for reducing hospital credit risk in high-DSH 
counties. 
6.3. Post-SCR uncertainty and issuance activity 
In this last section, we examine how ACA-associated 
uncertainties have affected healthcare municipal bond 
yields since the Supreme Court ruling in June 2012. 
Koijen et al. (2016) show that the risk of reimbursement 
cuts to hospitals is priced in healthcare equity markets. In 
a similar sense, the ACA may also increase healthcare mu- 
nicipal bond yields due to the possibility of future reim- 
bursement cuts by the federal or state governments. An- 
other possibility is that the ACA subsidies are eventually 
repealed through political channels while the existing re- 
imbursement cuts remain in place. Although most repeal 
effort 
s have failed due to misalignments between the leg- 
islative and executive branches, it is not guaranteed that 
these misalignments will persist in the future. Recogniz- 
ing these risks, MunicipalBonds.com, a major municipal 
bond investment advisory ﬁrm for retail and institutional 
investors, stated in March 2017 that risk-averse investors 
may want to explore other investment alternatives if “an 
issuer is heavily dependent on Obamacare to generate its 
revenue streams” ( 
Sangha, 2017 
). Thus, ACA-associated un- 
certainties may have a larger effect on the borrowing costs 
of long-term healthcare projects. 
We test the PostSCR effect on healthcare offering yield 
spreads by bond maturity to identify the effect of ACA un- 
certainty. First, we separate the municipal bonds in our 
sample into maturity terciles. Bonds in the lowest ma- 
turity tercile (short-term bonds) have a maturity of less 
than 5 years, and bonds in the highest maturity tercile 
(long-term bonds) have a maturity of more than 10 years. 
Then, we test our baseline regression model in Eq. (2) for 
each of these maturity subsamples. The results of these 
tests are reported in columns 1–3 of Table 11 
. Accord- 
ing to column 1, the PostSCR effect on short-term health- 
care offering yield spreads is about −22.9 bps. By con- 
trast, according to columns 2 and 3, the PostSCR effects 
on the average medium- and long-term healthcare offer- 
ing yield spreads are −11.7 bps and −11.0 bps, respec- 
tively. We next test the differential effect of PostSCR on 
healthcare offering yield spreads for the different matu- 
rity terciles using our full sample of municipal bonds.

L represent indicator variables for medium-term bonds 
and long-term bonds, respectively. (The standalone indi- 
cator variables are also included in our vector of con- 
trols.) We ﬁnd in column 4 that the average PostSCR ef- 
fect is about −25.8 bps for short-term bonds, and only 
about −10.8 bps for medium and long-term healthcare 
bonds. Thus, the PostSCR effect is about 58% weaker 
for the longer maturities, where there is greater ACA 
uncertainty. 
The evidence in Table 11 can be used to determine 
the yield change for cash ﬂows payable in more than ﬁve 
years, allowing us to determine the net effect of PostSCR 
on longer-term healthcare cash ﬂows. Consider a pre-SCR, 
long-term healthcare municipal bond with 11 years until 
maturity, an annual coupon payment of $5.00, a face value 
payment of $100, and a yield of 3.82%. (For pre-SCR health- 
care bonds not in the lowest maturity tercile, 11 years is 
the median time to maturity, $5.00 is the modal annual 
coupon payment, and 3.82% is the average yield.) A sim- 
ple present value calculation indicates that the price of this 
bond is $110.44. We can then determine the pre-SCR yield- 
to-maturity on the cash ﬂows payable in more than ﬁve 
years (

Thus, the average yield on longer-term healthcare cash 
ﬂows increased by 2 bps (

) in the post-SCR 
period, compared to a decrease of 23 bps for short-term 
healthcare cash ﬂows. This evidence suggests that long- 
run risks associated with the ACA remain an obstacle to 
cheaper long-term borrowing in the healthcare municipal 
bond market. 
7. Conclusion 
Local hospitals have beneﬁted from the expanded in- 
sured customer base since the ACA went into effect in 
2014, even with the associated cuts to Medicare and DSH 
reimbursement rates. However, hospitals may be worse 
off in the long run if the federal and state governments 
continue to cut hospital reimbursement rates for treating 
publicly-insured patients, or if lawmakers repeal the ACA 
subsidies and leave the associated cuts in place. Given the 
additional policy risks, it is unclear whether the ACA im- 
proved local hospitals’ overall credit quality and thus their 
ability to cheaply borrow capital to ﬁnance new infrastruc- 
ture. 
In this study, we provide novel evidence that the ACA 
signiﬁcantly reduced credit risk for hospitals. In particu- 
lar, we show that the ACA immediately reduced health- 
care municipal bond yields by 8 bps after the Supreme 
Court ruled in favor of the constitutionality of the ACA in 
June 2012, and 20 bps over the next three years. The im- 
mediate reduction represents about $360 million in inter- 
est savings for healthcare bonds issued after the Supreme 
Court ruling. For states that voted to expand Medicaid un- 
der the ACA, the yield reduction is about twice as large as 
the yield reduction in non-expansion states, representing 
an additional $250 million in interest savings for health- 
care bonds issued in those states after their expansion. 
Supporting evidence from hospital admissions records in- 
dicates that the overall reduction in healthcare yields is 
strongly related to an increase in emergency room usage 
by newly-insured patients. We also document important 
real ACA effects from an investment perspective. In partic- 
ular, we ﬁnd that investment spending increased while the 
sensitivity of investment spending to cash ﬂow shocks de- 
creased after the implementation of the ACA. Overall, our 
evidence suggests that the ACA-associated improvements 
to hospital credit risk are largely demand-driven, but only 
after a suﬃcient resolution of legal uncertainty surround- 
ing the ACA. 
The ACA-associated reductions in hospital credit risk 
are weaker for certain hospitals, suggesting additional op- 
portunities for policy improvements. For example, rural 
hospitals do not experience any reduction in credit risk 
if the state does not vote to expand Medicaid, underlin- 
ing the importance of Medicaid access in rural areas. This 
evidence also suggests that the ACA subsidies to purchase 
private insurance on ACA exchanges were not material for 
reducing hospital credit risk in rural areas, where pre- 
miums remain relatively high due to a lack of insurance 
competition on ACA exchanges. Policymakers in Alaska, a 
largely rural state, responded to this issue in 2016 by in- 
troducing a reinsurance program in which the state would 
cover claims for residents with high-cost medical condi- 
tions. As a result, overall insurance premiums in Alaska 
have remained fairly low compared to other states. Our ev- 
idence suggests that other states could take a targeted ap- 
proach and introduce reinsurance programs in rural areas 
where the number of insurers is below some competitive 
threshold. Of course, additional policy changes that build 
upon the ACA would be ineffective if the ACA is even- 
tually repealed. Indeed, the near-zero changes on the far 
end of the healthcare yield curve we document in this 
study suggest that repeal risk is still signiﬁcantly priced 
in healthcare municipal bond markets. Our results suggest 
that a resolution of the political uncertainty surrounding 
the ACA would further reduce the yield premium on long- 
term healthcare municipal bonds and thus promote long- 
term economic growth in the healthcare sector.

Key Words:
H7N9
Vaccination
Compliance
Analytical knowledge
Emotions and personal experience
Background: The emergence of the avian inﬂuenza A (H7N9) in China during 2013 illustrates the importance
of health care professionals as a mediating channel between health agencies and the public. Our study
examined health care professionals’ risk perceptions considering their unique position as representing the
health care system and yet also being part of the public, hence a risk group. Recent studies have examined the
role of health professionals’ personal risk perceptions and attitudes regarding compliance of the general
public with vaccination. Our study examined how risk perception affects their risk analysis.
Methods: We employed an online survey of Israeli health care professionals and the general public in
Israel (N ¼ 240).
Results: When risk perception is relatively low, health care professionals tend to base their attitudes
toward vaccines on analytical knowledge (Rc ¼ 0.315; P < .05), whereas in situations with high risk
perception, the results did not indicate any signiﬁcant difference between Israeli health professionals and
the Israeli general public, hence both groups base their attitudes more on emotions and personal
experience than on analytical knowledge.
Conclusions: Public health organizations must consider the fact that health professionals are a group that
cannot be automatically treated as an extension of the organization. When the risk is tangible and relevant,
health care workers behave and act like everybody else. Our study contributes to understanding health
care professionals’ perceptions about vaccines and the thinking processes underlying such perceptions.

Avian inﬂuenza A (H7N9) emerged in The People’s Republic of
China during 2013. The ongoing epizootic of H7N9 inﬂuenza in
eastern China as of June 2013 was associated with 132 conﬁrmed
human infections and 39 related deaths.1 To date, there is no evi-
dence of ongoing human-to-human transmission. Because the
H7N9 virus had not previously been detected in humans or ani-
mals, the situation raises many urgent questions and global public
health concerns and comprises “yet another reminder that we must
continue to prepare for the next inﬂuenza pandemic.”2
Preparation during the crisis was not only epidemiologicy but
also consisted of global and local health organizations’ erecting
their media operations. The main focus was the process of
risk
communication
with
the
public
to
obtain
vaccination
compliance, if needed. Risk communication literature tries to
explain the mechanisms and elements that comprise human risk
perception. Slovic et al3 have explored the association between
the analytical and emotional aspects of risk perception, speciﬁcally
the association between analytical risk analysis and experience-
based risk perception. The analytical system model was pre-
sented as a person’s ability to analyze rules and norms and
calculate risks and opportunities, whereas the experiential system
model was presented as intuitive, quick, automatic, and partially
subconscious.3
The studies in the literature assessing the public’s risk percep-
tions deal alternately with analytical and experiential aspects. For
example, Goodwin and Sun4 investigated initial beliefs about the
disease, knowledge, media use, anxiety, and behavioral responses
to H7N9. Despite anxiety, participants largely trusted ofﬁcial mes-
sages, particularly from Chinese ofﬁcials. Respondents correctly
identiﬁed symptoms of H7N9. Worry was related to viewing some

groups at greater risk, including sexually active persons and mi-
grants. Forty-one percent had already bought medicines due to
the threat, although few (7%) were willing to self-quarantine if
infected.
In the history of the study of seasonal and epidemic ﬂu, pride of
place is given to public opinion studies of the positions and risk
perceptions of different populations as variables that inﬂuence
their responsiveness to vaccination. For example, studies on H1N1
inﬂuenza have found that public opinion is divided regarding
vaccinations and that there are many barriers that cause people not
to vaccinate, including barriers related to mistrust of governments
and authorities,5,6 cognitive barriers related to the risk perception
that a healthy person does not need to get vaccinated,7 fear of
vaccine
side
effects,
concerns
about
vaccine
safety and
its
manufacturing process, and perceiving the vaccine as only partially
protective.8,9
Health care workers have been studied intensively because they
are uniquely positioned as an extension of the health care system
and yet also as part of the public, therefore comprising a risk group.
According to ofﬁcial European Centre for Disease Prevention and
Control documents, health professionals constitute “the message”
and the voice of the organization.z
Some studies of risk perception treat the difference between the
public’s risk perception and that of experts.10-13 The psychometric
paradigm, for example, suggests that the public’s risk perception is
inﬂuenced by dread, uncertainty, and lack of familiarity and
controllability afﬁliated with the hazard, and that this is at variance
with the risk perception of health experts.12
In the risk communication literature health care workers often
appear as the “experts” who process information about the risk
differently from the public. The mental models approach14 in-
dicates
a
differentiation
between
experts
and
the
public,
concluding that studies need to be conducted with the public to
shape risk communication messages to address the gaps or in-
consistencies in the audience’s knowledge. However, from studies
on health care workers it has been found that there are many
barriers that inﬂuence their lack of compliance with vaccination,
although they are a “professional” public.15,16
Studies of health care workers have found that their barriers
regarding vaccinations are similar to those of the rest of the
public that is concerned about side effects, the novelty of the
vaccination, and lack of faith in its efﬁcacy and in the severity of
the disease.17-19
Studies indicate that health care workers who choose to vacci-
nate20-22 and those do not23,24 encode the same epidemiologic data
differently. A health care professional’s decision to vaccinate de-
pends on his or her faith in the health system and its message.
Health care professionals are often in a situation of cognitive
dissonance,25 wherein their professional obligation to recommend
vaccination clashes with their personal values and perceptions. The
literature rarely deals with the processes that underlie this
ambivalence and the barriers and concerns that overturn or un-
dermine their professional attitudes.
Our study tried to demonstrate how risk perception affects
risk analysis. The mental model approach indicates that whereas
health professionals analyze data concerning vaccines from a
scientiﬁc-rational perspective, the general public’s choices are
generated based on emotions and personal experience. Studies
have not examined if the assessment type (analytic vs experi-
mental) is affected by the perceived threat. We focused on Israeli
health care professionals’ processing of the risk and compared
health care professionals with the general public through a study
case of the H7N9 2013 inﬂuenza outbreak. Because that ﬂu
subtype virus did not spread beyond China, and is therefore at
the prepandemic phase, it is worthwhile to check the risk
perception of the general public and health care workers as a
basis for a potential risk communication plan. We aimed to
contribute to the public health literature devoted to under-
standing health care professionals’ risk perceptions and to enrich
the body of literature on preparation for risk communication
with the public.
We developed several distinct hypotheses. Hypothesis 1a: There
is a correlation between professional occupation and the tendency
to support a vaccine based solution in China, so that health care
professionals tend to support vaccination more than the general
public. Hypothesis 1b: There is a correlation between professional
occupation and reasoning type, so that health care professionals
tend to base their attitudes toward vaccination in China more on
analytic reasoning than the general public. Hypothesis 1c: There is
a correlation between the tendency to support a vaccine-based
solution in China and reasoning type, so that respondents who
support general vaccination in China, follow analytic reasoning
more than those who do not. Hypothesis 2a: There is a correlation
between professional occupation and the tendency to support a
vaccine-based solution in Israel, so that health care professionals
tend to support vaccination more than the general public. Hy-
pothesis 2b: There is a correlation between professional occupation
and reasoning type, so that health care professionals tend to base
their attitudes toward vaccination in Israel more on analytic
reasoning than does the general public. Hypothesis 2c: There is a
correlation between the tendency to support a vaccine-based so-
lution in Israel and reasoning type, so that respondents who sup-
port general vaccination in Israel follow analytic reasoning more
than those who do not.
METHODS
To examine the correlation between the professional occupation
and support for a vaccine-based solution, a survey was conducted.
We distributed our survey to 240 Israeli respondents (109 health
care workers and 131 members of the public) via different social
media outlets (Facebook, Twitter, and Googleþ). This research
secured University of Haifa, Faculty of Social Welfare & Health
Sciences Institutional Review Board committee approval under the
TELL ME project.
Sample
Our sample was designed using Google Docs online software
(Google Inc, Mountain View, Calif). It provided quick and efﬁcient
distribution of an interactive online questionnaire to our research
population (ie, Israeli health care professionals and the Israeli
general public). Namely, when dealing with real time health care
crises that, by nature, have a tendency to develop unexpectedly,
one must gather data quickly, because the constant evolution of
information can affect people’s attitudes and beliefs. For this
reason, we chose an online sampling method that enabled us to
reach a relatively large sample in a short time. Speciﬁcally, we used
a nonprobability stratiﬁed sampling to make sure that we had
enough representation of health care professionals in our ﬁnal
sample.
Measures
Participants completed a self-report questionnaire consisting
of 3 discrete parts. In the ﬁrst part, we introduced a real scenario
where there is a H7N9 outbreak in China that could potentially turn

into a pandemic. We explained that, as far as ofﬁcial health care
authorities know, all contagion cases were a result of direct contact
with poultry. In other words, the ﬁrst scenario characterizes a sit-
uation where there is no evidence of a human-to-human infection.
This narrative enabled us to understand people’s risk perceptions
regarding a potential risk that is, presumably, far both geographi-
cally and culturally. After the short scenario, participants were
asked to answer closed questions that measured the agreement
with the assumption that the World Health Organization needs to
develop a new vaccine and if the participant would agree to such a
vaccine treatment. This agreement was assessed with 2 questions:
“Do you agree that there is a need for a new vaccine?” and, “Do you
agree that there is a need to vaccinate the whole Chinese popula-
tion with the new vaccine?” Subjects were asked to rate their
opinions on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (“completely disagree”)
to 5 (“completely agree”). Then participants were asked to elabo-
rate as to why they (and their families) would vaccinate or avoid
vaccination. The equivalent open-ended question had a 2-fold
purpose. First, to understand the speciﬁc reasons underlying per-
ceptions regarding vaccines. Second, comparing 2 different in-
dicators that assessed the same attitudes helped us validate our
measurement of the closed-ended questions regarding vaccination
compliance.
Toassessthereasoningunderlyingattitudestowardvaccinationin
China and in Israel, 2 human coders were used. Both coders analyzed
a subsample of 60 questionnaires to generate intercoder reliability
scores. Each answer was coded as either analytic orexperimental. We
measured overall percent agreement, as well as Krippendorff’s a,26
for each answer (Krippendorff’s a represents the level of agreement
between codersbeyondmere chance). Overall,for bothquestions, the
between-coders agreement was satisfactory (vaccination in China,
a ¼ 0.79 [92%]; vaccination in Israel, a ¼ 0.72 [89%]).
The second part of the questionnaire presented a ﬁctitious
scenario where the H7N9 virus spread to Israel. The vaccine is
presumed to be effective but there is no real estimation of its
coverage or side effects. Afterward, participants were asked to
answer the question; “Do you agree that there is a need to vaccinate
the whole Israeli population with the new vaccine?” Subjects were
asked to rate their opinions on a 5-point scale ranging from 1
(“completely disagree”) to 5 (“completely agree”). Similar to the
ﬁrst scenario, an equivalent open-ended question assessed partic-
ipants’ attitudes toward vaccination in Israel.
The last part of the questionnaire was devoted to different de-
mographic variables, such as gender, age, professional occupation,
and education. This allowed us to ensure that we were successful in
creating a representative sample.
Sample
Our sample was diverse in terms of gender (33.8% men and 66.2%
women) and professional occupation (45.5% health care professional
and 54.5% general public). The mean age was 37.8  10.44 years.
With the exception of gender (which probably stems from a higher
percentage of women in the Israeli health care service), the sample
was successful in representing our target population of adult Israeli
health care workers and the Israeli adult public.
RESULTS
Hypothesis 1a predicted a correlation between professional
occupation and the tendency to support a general immunization
program in China, so that health care professionals tend to support
vaccination more than the general public. To test this hypothesis, a
t test for independent groups was conducted, with professional
occupation as the main independent variable and support for a
general immunization program in China as the dependent variable.
The
variance
between
different
occupations
was
signiﬁcant
(t[238] ¼ 3.59; P < .05), with the conﬁdence interval 0.159-0.547
consistent with the expectation of Hypothesis 1a. As this hypoth-
esis suggests, the mean difference between the groups revealed
that there is a higher level of support for vaccine-based solution in
China in the health care professionals group than in the general
public group (mean  standard deviation, 2.22  0.639 and 1.87 
0.838, respectively). The level of support for vaccines reported in
the health care professional group was 0.353 points higher (on a
1-5 scale) than that of the general public group.
To test Hypothesis 1b, data from the content analysis was
correlated with the professional occupation of the respondents.
Consistent with Hypothesis 1b, the pattern of results showcased
that health care professionals tend to base their answers more on
analytic reasoning than the general public in the case of China
(c2, 22.386; Rc, 0.315; P < .05). In fact, in the health care pro-
fessionals’ group, only 12 (11.01%) answers had some reference to
experimental explanations, whereas 47 (43.12%) answers referred
directly to analytic knowledge (eg, “in the last avian ﬂu, the vaccine
proved to be extremely effective and safe so why not vaccinate?”).x
As expected, the majority of respondents in the general public
group (64%) tended to support their opinions by experimental ar-
guments (eg, “I don’t know why, it just sounds unsafe”).
To test Hypothesis 1c, a t test for independent groups was
conducted with type of reasoning as the independent variable and
support for a general immunization program in China as the
dependent variable. The variance between different occupational
groups was signiﬁcant (t ¼ 3.08; P < .05) with the conﬁdence in-
terval ranging from 0.077-0.503, consistent with the expectation of
Hypothesis 1c. Following Hypothesis 1c, the pattern of results
demonstrated that those who follow analytic reasoning tend to
support vaccination in China more than those who follow experi-
mental reasoning.
Hypothesis 2a predicted a correlation between professional
occupation and the tendency to support a general immunization
program in Israel so that health care professionals tend to support
vaccination more than the general public. To test this hypothesis, a t
test for independent groups was conducted, with professional
occupation as the main independent variable and support for a
general immunization program in Israel as the dependent variable.
The variance between different occupational groups was insigniﬁ-
cant (t[238] ¼ 1.23; P ¼ not signiﬁcant), so that there was no evident
mean difference between the health care professionals and the
general public regarding support for vaccination in Israel. To test
Hypothesis 2b, data from the content analysis was correlated with
the professional occupation of the respondents. Inconsistent with
Hypothesis 2b, the pattern of results showcased that there is no
correlation between professional occupation and reasoning type
(c2 ¼ 4.048; P ¼ not signiﬁcant). Signiﬁcantly, both health care
professionals and the general public tended to base their answers
more on experimental reasoning (eg, “First, we need to look into
the side effects of this vaccine”). To test Hypothesis 2c, a t test for
independent groups was conducted, with type of reasoning as the
independent variable and support for a general immunization
program in Israel as the dependent variable. The variance between
different occupational groups was signiﬁcant (t ¼ 2.4; P <.05), with
the conﬁdence interval ranging from 0.056-0.567, consistent with
the expectation of Hypothesis 2c; the pattern of results demon-
strated that those who follow analytic reasoning tend to support
vaccination in Israel more than those who follow experimental
reasoning.
x The remaining 45.87% of the answers had either no reference to analytical or
experimental explanations or they were equally analytical and experimental.

DISCUSSION
The ﬁndings paint an interesting picture about health care
workers’ support for vaccination. When health care workers were
asked hypothetically about what their attitude toward vaccination
would be if they were citizens of China, the answer was more
supportive vaccination than in the second scenario, had the ﬂu
spread to Israel where they live. These gaps between the health
care workers’ answers can be interpreted using the distance vari-
able that inﬂuences their risk perception. In other words, when the
health care workers were asked about China, which is far from
them geographically and mentally, most said they were in favor of
vaccination. But when the question was if they would get vacci-
nated in Israel, where they live, the risk became relevant to them
and they expressed more reserved attitudes toward vaccination.
Slovic et al3 explored the association between an analytical risk
analysis and experience-based risk perception. The analytical system
model was presented as a person’s ability to analyze rules and norms
and calculate risks and opportunities, whereas the experiential
system model was presented as intuitive, quick, automatic, and
partially subconscious. There is a tendency to view affective re-
sponses to risk as irrational. According to Slovic et al3 the rational
and experiential systems operate separately and yet each seems to
depend on the other for guidance. Both of these models demon-
strated in the studies exist simultaneously and interdependently. A
rational decision, according to Slovic et al,3 relies on emotions and
thoughts. Their conclusion can explain the ﬁndings of our study:
when the risk gets close, a person cannot remain “analytical”
without mixing in feelings, emotions, intuition, and prior experience.
When the health care workers in our study were asked in the
ﬁrst scenario about the ﬂu in China, they could respond without
considering effect. When they were asked in the second scenario
about their attitude toward vaccination if the epidemic occurred in
their close environment, their answers reﬂected feelings, fears, and
their prior experience from past epidemics and integrated all of
these, leading to less clear-cut and unequivocal answers.
Furthermore, we argue that the health care workers’ attitude
toward vaccination in China allowed them to maintain their pro-
fessional perspective as the representatives of the health system,
which universally supports and recommends vaccination (when
there is a risk of contracting inﬂuenza). However, when the health
care workers were asked about getting vaccinated in their close
environment, they adopted the perspective of the public, including
the barriers and difﬁculties that lead people to choose not to get
vaccinated. This explanation is in line with ﬁndings from the
literature that indicate barriers and obstacles that make health care
workers fail to comply with vaccinations.15
We can also understand the gap between the health care
workers’ answers through the concept of “optimistic bias.” It has
been found that people tend to give a lower estimate of their own
risk compared with others’.27,28 Researchers claim that this phe-
nomenon affects human behavior, so that reducing optimistic bias
would encourage risk-reducing behavior and decrease rates of
illness or hazards.27,29
In the context of our ﬁndings, health care workers attached
greater risk to what was going on “over there” in China than to
what was happening at home. In other words, when something
happens to other people in another place, the risk is perceived as
worse than when it is close by. When the risk hit home, they
brought in alleviating and optimistic perceptions as to the severity
of their condition. In this vein, a study of risk perception in the
context of H1N1 revealed that people expressed lower risk per-
ceptions toward H1N1 relative to their peers.30 This suggests that
people are not passive, unbiased, or unmotivated recipients of in-
formation about risks. Such ﬁndings indicate that the effect of risk
communication
on
self-protecting
behavior
is
signiﬁcantly
moderated by people’s predisposed risk perceptions.
Although our main hypothesis was conﬁrmed, this study is not
free of methodologic limitations. A possible critique could focus on
our nonprobability sampling procedure and measuring. Although
we cannot rule out this possible criticism, our data offer some ev-
idence against it. The fact that all participants were requested to
answer 2 open-ended questions asking them to elaborate on their
vaccination decision gave us an opportunity to validate our mea-
surement through an expectation based on previous studies.
Speciﬁcally, the fact that the majority of health care professionals
tended to base their opinions regarding the vaccine on analytical
notions, whereas the general public based their choices on expe-
rience, suggests that there is a strong case for construct validity in
our study. Second, because our study is based on a small subpop-
ulation (ie, health care professionals), the choice of a snowball
sampling technique seems more of a necessity than convenience.
Although this choice could have threatened the validity of our
survey, this claim can be contested by the descriptive statistics
presented, suggesting that we were able to reach a diverse sample,
as far as demographic variables.
CONCLUSIONS
The conclusions of our study indicate that public health orga-
nizations must consider the fact that health professionals are a
group that cannot be automatically treated as an extension of the
organization. When the risk is tangible and relevant, health care
workers behave and act like everybody else: they mix intuition and
emotions with analytical analysis, creating a complex risk percep-
tion with an optimistic bias. The innovative aspect of this study was
our attempt to quantify the gap between risk perceptions of health
care works and the general public by correlating it with distinct
thinking patterns. From this point of view, the challenge is to deal
with health care workers’ barriers by including them in planning
and building the risk communication plan while addressing their
fears and concerns. Preliminary work with this group will help
build simulations (different scenarios) to improve communication
with the general public.

Highlights

Adults with liver disease are more likely to report issues
affording medical services and prescription medication.

Adults with liver disease facing healthcare affordability and
accessibility issues are at 24% higher risk of death.

Women, age <65 years, residence in the US South region,
and lower income were risk factors for affordability/acces-
sibility issues.
Impact and implications
Adults with liver disease use many medical services, but long-
term national studies regarding the ﬁnancial repercussions and
the effects on mortality for such patients are lacking. This study
shows that adults with liver disease are more likely to face is-
sues affording medical services and prescription medication,
experience delays in medical care, and needing but not
obtaining medical care owing to cost, compared with adults
without liver disease, adults with cancer history, are equally
likely as adults with coronary artery disease, and less likely than
adults with emphysema—patients with liver disease who face
these issues are at increased risk of death. This study provides
the impetus for medical providers and policymakers to prioritise
interventions to improve healthcare affordability for adults with
liver disease.

Background & Aims: Liver disease is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality, likely incurring ﬁnancial distress (i.e.
healthcare affordability and accessibility issues), although long-term national-level data are limited.
Methods: Using the National Health Interview Survey from 2004 to 2018, we categorised adults based on report of liver disease
and other chronic conditions linked to mortality data from the National Death Index. We estimated age-adjusted proportions of
adults reporting healthcare affordability and accessibility issues. Multivariable logistic regression and Cox regression were used to
assess the association of liver disease with ﬁnancial distress and ﬁnancial distress with all-cause mortality, respectively.
Results: Among adults with liver disease (n = 19,407) vs. those without liver disease (n = 996,352), those with cancer history (n =
37,225), those with emphysema (n = 7,937), and those with coronary artery disease (n = 21,510), the age-adjusted proportion
reporting healthcare affordability issues for medical services was 29.9% (95% CI 29.7–30.1%) vs. 18.1% (95% CI 18.0–18.3%),
26.5% (95% CI 26.3–26.7%), 42.2% (95% CI 42.1–42.4%), and 31.6% (31.5–31.8%), respectively, and for medications: 15.5%
(95% CI 15.4–15.6%) vs. 8.2% (95% CI 8.1–8.3%), 14.8% (95% CI 14.7–14.9%), 26.1% (95% CI 26.0–26.2%), and 20.6% (95%
CI 20.5–20.7%), respectively. In multivariable analysis, liver disease (vs. without liver disease, vs. cancer history, vs. emphysema,
and vs. coronary artery disease) was associated with inability to afford medical services (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.84, 95% CI
1.77–1.92; aOR 1.32, 95% CI 1.25–1.40; aOR 0.91, 95% CI 0.84–0.98; and aOR 1.11, 95% CI 1.04–1.19, respectively) and
medications (aOR 1.92, 95% CI 1.82–2.03; aOR 1.24, 95% CI 1.14–1.33; aOR 0.81, 95% CI 0.74–0.90; and aOR 0.94, 95% CI
0.86–1.02, respectively), delays in medical care (aOR 1.77, 95% CI 1.69–1.87; aOR 1.14, 95% CI 1.06–1.22; aOR 0.88, 95% CI
0.79–0.97; and aOR 1.05, 95% CI 0.97–1.14, respectively), and not receiving the needed medical care (aOR 1.86, 95% CI
1.76–1.96; aOR 1.16, 95% CI 1.07–1.26; aOR 0.89, 95% CI 0.80–0.99; aOR 1.06, 95% CI 0.96–1.16, respectively). In multivariable
analysis, among adults with liver disease, ﬁnancial distress (vs. without ﬁnancial distress) was associated with increased all-cause
mortality (aHR 1.24, 95% CI 1.01–1.53).
Conclusions: Adults with liver disease face greater ﬁnancial distress than adults without liver disease and adults with cancer
history. Financial distress is associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality among adults with liver disease. Interventions to
improve healthcare affordability should be prioritised in this population.

Introduction
Chronic liver disease is the 11th leading cause of death
worldwide, accounting for 1.32 million deaths in 2019.1 In the
USA, the prevalence of chronic liver disease has nearly doubled
over the past two decades with cirrhosis-related mortality rising
in parallel.2–4 Healthcare utilisation for liver disease has
increased, including inpatient hospitalisations for advanced
chronic liver disease, infections, and portal hypertensive com-
plications.5–10
Healthcare
expenditure,
as
a
result,
has
increased, with US healthcare spending totalling $32.5 billion
as of 2016.11
Increases in healthcare expenditure have translated into
higher annual out-of-pocket costs for adults with liver dis-
ease.7,12 Medical debt among this population ranges from 24 to
46%, with 7–8% ﬁling for medical bankruptcy, compared with
3% among adults with cancer history, a well-described cohort
who incur medical debt.13–15 Consequently, adults with liver
disease are 40% more likely to experience hardship from
medical bills (i.e. ﬁnancial burden).16,17 To address ﬁnancial
burden incurred from medical expenses, several studies have
described trade-offs in medical care (i.e. ﬁnancial distress17)
such

insecurity.16 These trade-offs have resulted in higher healthcare
utilisation, particularly in the inpatient and emergency room
settings (i.e. ﬁnancial toxicity).16
However, ﬁnancial distress in adults with liver disease is not
well studied on a national level. Most data that exist are limited
to single-centre studies with small sample sizes.13 Such data
are prone to bias and may not be substantial enough to provide
impetus for policy change. The few studies that do use national
databases include short study periods that limit the ability to
examine the impact of major legislation, such as the Affordable
Care Act, which drastically changed health insurance coverage
in the USA, particularly in low-income populations.7,16,18
Furthermore, the relationship between ﬁnancial distress and
mortality is lacking. Financial distress has been shown in adults
with cancer history and cardiovascular disease to be associ-
ated with increased mortality.19,20 Establishing and quantifying
the effect of ﬁnancial distress on mortality among adults with
liver disease would be useful to determine whether in-
terventions to alleviate ﬁnancial distress are needed and
whether they would be cost-effective.
In this study, we sought to quantify ﬁnancial distress
(healthcare affordability and accessibility issues) in adults with
liver disease compared with adults without liver disease and
other chronic diseases from 2004 to 2018 in a nationally
representative sample. We then sought to evaluate the differ-
ential impact of ﬁnancial distress on mortality and identify de-
mographic factors associated with healthcare affordability and
accessibility issues among adults with liver disease.
Patients and methods
Data sources
The National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) is conducted by
the government US Census Bureau and is a nationally repre-
sentative annual, cross-sectional survey administered to non-
institutionalised non-military individuals, which aggregates
family, household, person, and adult surveys. The NHIS uses
complex sampling to provide estimates representative of the
entire US population (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhis/1997-2
018.htm).21 Data were collected through questionnaires with
information
regarding
demographic
characteristics,
health
conditions, and socio-economic factors at both family and
person levels administered by trained interviewers in a face-to-
face format. The survey has been validated and used to assess
issues of healthcare affordability and access among other
subspecialties.16,22–24 We linked the individual-level data from
the NHIS to the National Death Index, which is a centralised
national database of death record information compiled by
state governments, to obtain vital status (https://www.cdc.gov/
nchs/ndi/index.htm).25
Study design and study population
This was a population-based study using cross-sectional data
from serial nationally representative samples of adults >
−18
years of age who participated in the NHIS from 2004 to 2018.
Adults were categorised as with liver disease if they answered
‘yes’ to the following questions: ‘Ever had any chronic liver
condition?’ or ‘Told had a liver condition, past 12 months’ or
‘Ever told by a doctor you had cancer? What kind of cancer .
liver?’ or ‘Ever had hepatitis?’ (Table S1). Adults who answered
‘no’ to these questions were categorised as without liver dis-
ease and further divided into subgroups of history of cancer
(Table S2), history of emphysema, or history of coronary artery
disease based on responding ‘yes’ to ‘Ever told by a doctor you
had cancer?’, ‘Ever had a history of emphysema?’, or ‘Ever had
a history of coronary artery disease?’, respectively (Fig. 1). Liver
cancer was excluded from the comparison subgroup of adults
with history of cancer. Coronary artery disease, emphysema,
and cancer were subgroups of ‘without liver disease’ and
chosen as comparator groups because they are common
chronic diseases with high cost and common acute decom-
pensating events, which garner attention from the lay popula-
tion, policymakers, and clinicians alike, and they would provide
context to our ﬁndings regarding the ﬁnancial burden of liver
disease. Based on the wording of the question, participants
categorised in the history of cancer group may have had a
history rather than a current diagnosis of cancer. These groups
were not mutually exclusive.
Demographic variables
Self-reported age, sex, race, Hispanic ethnicity, marital status,
geographic region, educational level, employment status, ac-
cess to paid sick leave, household income, insurance status,
and alcohol use were collected. Alcohol use was further char-
acterised as ‘abstinent’ (no lifetime drinks), ‘former’ (no drinks in
the past year), and ‘current’ (drank within the past year). We
also collected information regarding self-reported medical
conditions such as coronary artery disease, emphysema, hy-
pertension, and diabetes.
Outcomes
Our outcome was healthcare affordability and accessibility
issues, using services and deﬁnitions available in the NHIS
previously
validated
as
measures
of
global
healthcare
affordability.22,24,26–28
Healthcare affordability
Speciﬁcally, healthcare affordability issues were deﬁned as
answering ‘yes’ to inability to afford one or more of six medical
services (prescription medications, mental healthcare, dental
care, eyeglasses, specialist care, and follow-up care) in the
previous 12 months.
Healthcare accessibility
Healthcare accessibility was deﬁned as answering ‘yes’ to
questions asking adults whether their medical care was
delayed in the past 12 months or whether they needed but
could not afford medical care.
Financial distress
Financial distress was deﬁned as answering ‘yes’ to questions
assessing healthcare affordability (prescription medications,
mental healthcare, dental care, eyeglasses, specialist care, and
follow-up care) or healthcare accessibility (delays in medical
care and needing but could not afford medical care).
Mortality
We also assessed all-cause mortality. The NHIS Public-Use
Linked Mortality ﬁle was used, with mortality determined for
NHIS adults via linkage to the US National Death Index through
330

Healthcare affordability and mortality in adults with liver disease
2019. Follow-up time was measured from time of NHIS inter-
view until death. Adults without a death record were considered
alive and censored at the last follow-up (31 December 2019).
Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses used stratiﬁcation, clustering, and sam-
pling weights to account for the complex survey design. Survey
characteristics were estimated as weighted means and per-
centages stratiﬁed by the presence of liver disease.
Age-adjusted proportion of healthcare affordability issues
We calculated age-adjusted proportions of adults reporting
issues with healthcare affordability by survey year (calculated
using the direct standardisation based on the standard 2000
US population) for adults with liver disease and adults without
liver disease, adults with history of cancer, adults with coronary
artery disease, and adults with emphysema.
Multivariable logistic regression
We created multivariable logistic regression models to assess
differences by adjusted odds ratio (aOR) in healthcare acces-
sibility and affordability between adults with liver disease and
adults without liver disease, adults with cancer history, adults
with emphysema, and adults with coronary artery disease. All
models were adjusted for recognised potential confounders
determined a priori by literature review (age, sex, marital status,
survey year, region, education, working for pay, household in-
come, and insurance status [insured vs. uninsured])17 (directed
acyclic graph in Fig. S1). We performed multiple imputation to
handle missing data for household income29 for the entire study
period using datasets obtained from the NHIS website (http://
www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhis.htm) containing imputed values. All
other variables in multivariable models had <4% missingness.
As race and ethnicity are social constructs without biological
implications and our models were adjusted for key social
determinants of health (income, education level, employment
status, and insurance), race and ethnicity were not included in
our models.30
Our models assessed four outcomes: (1) unable to afford one
or more of six medical services (prescription medications, mental
healthcare, dental care, eyeglasses, specialist care, and follow-
up care), (2) unable to afford prescription medications, (3) delays
in medical care in the past 12 months, and (4) needing but did
not obtain medical care in the previous 12 months.
To evaluate the impact of the Affordable Care Act and ac-
count for the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, which likely had a
negative economic impact on the study participants, we
divided
the
study
period
into
three
eras:
2004–2007,
2008–2010, and 2011–2018.
As our liver disease cohort likely includes participants with
acute and chronic liver disease, we performed a subanalysis in
an attempt to assess participants with chronic liver disease
only. In this subanalysis, we repeated the main analysis using a
restricted deﬁnition of liver disease to include adults who
answered ‘yes’ to ‘Ever had any chronic liver condition?’ or
‘Ever told by a doctor you had cancer? What kind of cancer .
liver?’ (Table S1).
Mortality analysis
We estimated all-cause age-adjusted mortality rates stratiﬁed
by the presence vs. absence of ﬁnancial stress. We used left-
truncated time-to-event methods with age as the underlying
time scale for Kaplan–Meier and Cox proportional hazards
regression models, which were used to construct mortality
curves and estimate adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) for ﬁnan-
cial distress, respectively. Follow-up began at the time of
survey. The models were adjusted for recognised con-
founders determined a priori by literature review (sex, region,
education, household income, and insurance status [insured
vs. uninsured]).17

Results
Of the 1,015,759 adults included in the study, 19,407 had liver
disease. Adults with (vs. without) liver disease were more often
aged 50–65 years (38.2 vs. 24.6%), Alaskan Native/Native
American (1.3 vs. 0.9%), unmarried (57.3 vs. 44.8%), originating
from the western US region (25.8 vs. 22.8%), not working for
pay (58.1 vs. 39.7%), and with public insurance (36.5 vs.
20.4%), and had less than a high school degree (16.1 vs.
14.1%). Compared with adults with other chronic conditions
(history of cancer, emphysema, and coronary artery disease),
adults with liver disease were more often aged 50–65 years
(38.2 vs. 28.2, 33.2, and 27.6%, respectively), Alaskan Native/
Native American (1.3 vs. 0.5, 0.7, and 0.7%, respectively), of
Hispanic ethnicity (14.2 vs. 4.4, 4.6, and 7.2%, respectively),
and originated from the western US region (25.8 vs. 21.0, 17.1,
and 16.4%, respectively). Full baseline demographics are
summarised in Table 1.
Trends in healthcare affordability issues
Age-adjusted proportions of adults reporting inability to afford
one or more of six medical services by year are shown in
Fig. 2A. When compared with issues among adults with other
chronic conditions, issues affording medical services were
most common among adults with emphysema (42.2% [95%
CI 42.1–42.4%]), followed by adults with coronary artery dis-
ease (31.6% [95% CI 31.5–31.8%]), liver disease (29.9% [95%
CI 29.7–30.1%]), and history of cancer (26.5% [95% CI
26.3–26.7%]) (Fig. 3A).
Age-adjusted proportions of adults reporting inability to
afford prescription medications by year are shown in Fig. 2B.
Medication affordability issues were more common in adults
with liver disease (15.5% [95% CI 15.4–15.6%]) than in adults
without liver disease (8.2% [95% CI 8.1–8.3%]) throughout the
study period. Medication affordability issues were more com-
mon
among
adults
with
liver
disease
(15.5%
[95%
CI
15.4–15.6%]) than among those with history of cancer (14.8%
[95% CI 14.7–14.9%]) but not among those with coronary ar-
tery disease (20.6% [95% CI 20.5–20.7%]) or emphysema
(26.1% [95% CI 26.0–26.1%]) (Fig. 3B).
Healthcare affordability and accessibility by liver
disease status
Healthcare affordability and accessibility issues in adults with
liver disease vs. other chronic conditions are summarised in
Table 2. In multivariable analysis, adults with liver disease were
more likely than adults with without liver disease to report
inability to afford one or more of six medical services (aOR 1.84,
95% CI 1.77–1.92, p <0.0001), inability to afford medications
(aOR 1.92, 95% CI 1.82–2.03, p <0.0001), delays in medical
care (aOR 1.77, 95% CI 1.69–1.87, p <0.0001), and needing but
not receiving medical care (aOR 1.86, 95% CI 1.76–1.96,
p <0.0001). Full multivariable models are shown in Tables S8
and S9. Age-adjusted proportions of adults with (vs. without)
liver disease reporting inability to afford each of the six medical
services are shown in Fig. S2.

generally declined after 2010. In multivariable analysis, the
2011–2018 (vs. 2008–2010) era was associated with lower
odds of inability to afford one or more of six medical services
(aOR 0.91, 95% CI 0.88–0.93, p <0.0001), inability to afford
medications (aOR 0.78, 95% CI 0.75–0.80, p <0.001), delays in
medical care (aOR 0.84, 95% CI 0.82–0.86, p <0.0001), and
needing but not receiving medical care (aOR 0.88, 95% CI
0.85–0.90, p <0.0001) (Tables S8 and S9).
In multivariable analysis, adults with liver disease were more
likely than adults with history of cancer to report inability to
afford one or more of six medical services, inability to afford
medications, delays in medical care, and needing but not
receiving medical care (Table S10). Adults with liver disease
were less likely than adults with emphysema to report inability
to afford one or more of six medical services, inability to afford
medications, delays in medical care, and needing but not
receiving medical care (Table S11). Adults with liver disease
were more likely than adults with coronary artery disease to
report inability to afford one or more of six medical services,
and adults with liver disease and adults with coronary artery
disease were equally likely to report inability to afford medica-
tions, delays in medical care, and needing but not receiving
medical care (Table S12).
In a subanalysis using a restricted deﬁnition of liver disease
intended as an attempt to assess only participants with
chronic liver disease, including only adults who answered
‘yes’ to ‘Ever had any chronic liver condition?’ or ‘Ever told by
a doctor you had cancer? What kind of cancer . liver?’, our
results were similar for adults with liver disease, adults without
liver disease, and adults with history of cancer. However,
adults with liver disease and adults with coronary artery dis-
ease or emphysema were equally likely to report inability to
afford one or more of six medical services, inability to afford
medications, delays in medical care, and needing but not
receiving medical care (Table S13).
Factors associated with healthcare affordability and
accessibility issues among liver disease
Multivariable
models
examining
factors
associated
with
healthcare affordability and accessibility issues in adults with
liver disease are shown in Table 3. Age <65 years, female sex,
residence in the US Census Southern and Western regions,
lack of insurance, and lower income were associated with
increased likelihood of healthcare affordability and accessibility
issues. Diabetes was associated with increased likelihood of
healthcare affordability issues and delays in care only. Former
and current alcohol use were both associated with increased
likelihood of healthcare affordability and accessibility issues.
Effect of healthcare affordability and accessibility issues on
mortality among liver disease
Among adults with liver disease, all-cause age-adjusted mor-
tality rates were higher in adults reporting ﬁnancial distress
(15.1 [95% CI 14.5–15.6] deaths per 1,000 population) than in
those without ﬁnancial distress (11.3 [95% CI 10.7–11.8] per
1,000 population) (p <0.001) (Fig. S3). In multivariable analysis,
332
Journal of Hepatology, August 2023. vol. 79 j 329–339
Healthcare affordability and mortality in adults with liver disease
ﬁnancial distress (vs. without) was associated with higher risk of
all-cause mortality (aHR 1.24, 95% CI 1.01–1.53) (Table 4 and
Table S14). Among ﬁnancial distress components, inability to
afford medical services (aHR 1.27, 95% CI 1.13–1.44) and
inability to afford medications (aHR 1.49, 95% CI 1.29–1.71)
were associated with increased risk of mortality, whereas de-
lays in medical care (aHR 1.12, 95% CI 0.96–1.31) and needing
but not receiving medical care (aHR 1.02, 95% CI 0.86–1.20)
were associated with similar risk of mortality (Table 4 and
Tables S15–S18).
Discussion
In this national cohort study, we show that adults with liver
disease are more likely than adults with cancer history, equally
likely as adults with coronary artery disease, and less likely than
adults with emphysema to report healthcare affordability and
accessibility issues. We observed an overall improvement in
the affordability of medical services from 2011 to 2018, which
coincides with the enactment of the Affordable Care Act,
national legislation that increased accessibility of medical ser-
vices and coverage of medication,31 supporting the potential
value in governmental policies that expand healthcare insur-
ance. The Affordable Care Act provided tax credits and cost-
sharing subsidies to reduce out-of-pocket spending for adults
with income under the federal poverty limit and promote the
purchase of health insurance. This has led to increased
healthcare access and utilisation, particularly in low-income
groups.32–34 Despite some improvement in healthcare afford-
ability issues after 2011, our study highlights the fact that adults
with
liver
disease
continue
to
face
signiﬁcant
ﬁnancial
distress.7,16,18 Future studies exploring effective interventions
addressing ﬁnancial distress with liver disease are criti-
cally needed.
We found that adults with liver disease facing ﬁnancial
distress had a 24% higher risk of all-cause mortality after
adjustment for confounders. Although the negative effect of
ﬁnancial distress on mortality (e.g. ﬁnancial toxicity) is well
established in other chronic diseases, such as cancer history
and cardiovascular disease, this is not as well described for

adults with liver disease.19,35 More speciﬁcally, we showed that
issues accessing medical services and affording prescription
medications were associated with 27% and 49% increased risk
of mortality, respectively. Previous studies have demonstrated
improved
liver-related
mortality
in
government-funded
Medicaid expansion states vs. non-expansion states36; we
hypothesise that comprehensive insurance for at-risk pop-
ulations provides greater access to medical services and
coverage of prescription medications, thus decreasing the
negative effect of ﬁnancial distress and mortality observed in
our study.
Although the primary mechanism of ﬁnancial toxicity in the
USA is thought to be secondary to high out-of-pocket costs for
medical care, ﬁnancial toxicity in adults with chronic disease is
also prevalent in countries with socialised healthcare systems;
for example, a study from France found that 51% of patients
with a history of cancer reported ﬁnancial toxicity.23,37–39 The
relationship between ﬁnancial toxicity and chronic liver disease
is not well studied globally. However, chronic liver disease
contributes to signiﬁcant economic losses as a result of
morbidity, mortality, and high inpatient costs in both Europe
and Asia, which may not be completely mitigated by socialised
healthcare and could result in ﬁnancial toxicity.40–45 Given that
liver disease is often diagnosed in late stages after a clinically
signiﬁcant event, we hypothesise that reformation of healthcare
systems globally to focus on early detection and prevention of
decompensated liver disease rather than on treatment and
diagnosis at the time of decompensation may be more cost-
effective and may mitigate the ﬁnancial burden of liver dis-
ease.44 We also hypothesise that other causal mechanisms are

Healthcare affordability and mortality in adults with liver disease
important from our observed results. For example, alcohol use
(former and current) conferred a 40–60% increased risk of
mortality. Harmful alcohol use may cause liver disease or
exacerbate
underlying
liver
disease,
thereby
precipitating
ﬁnancial distress and mortality, although the exact mechanism
for these ﬁndings cannot be ascertained from this study.
Separately, alcohol use has been previously linked to psycho-
logical distress and income reductions, which can exacerbate
the ﬁnancial distress from liver disease.46 Indeed, social re-
lationships,
economic
hardship
from
unemployment,
and
harmful alcohol use as a maladaptive coping mechanism have
been associated with increased mortality among adults with
cirrhosis or other chronic diseases globally and may be linked
to ﬁnancial toxicity.47,48 Although alcohol use has decreased in
Europe, it still accounts for a signiﬁcant proportion of liver
disease.44,49
In
addition,
high-risk
drinking
and
alcohol-
associated liver disease are on the rise in the USA and
Asia.50,51 Such alarming ﬁndings should provide impetus to
enact global policy changes to reduce alcohol intake and start
initiatives for early screening and interventions for alcohol use
disorder.49 Our study adds evidence and provides quantiﬁca-
tion that increased access to comprehensive health insurance
coverage, in addition to social policies that address the
morbidity and disability from chronic disease, may be important

interventions
to
mitigate
ﬁnancial
distress
and
improve
survival outcomes for adults with liver diseases throughout
the world.
Our results identiﬁed key demographic subgroups associ-
ated with ﬁnancial distress (female sex, age <65 years, resi-
dence in the US Census Southern and Western regions, and
annual income <$75,000) among adults with liver disease,
which represent potential targets for future interventions.
Although causality cannot be conﬁrmed, our results do have
signiﬁcant plausibility and build on previous studies. The
increased likelihood of ﬁnancial distress among adults aged
<65 years and the uninsured highlights the potential protective
effect of insurance coverage against ﬁnancial distress, as
American adults automatically gain access to government-
funded Medicare insurance at the age of 65 years. Our re-
sults build on previous observational studies describing women
as an at-risk population, highlighting the potential importance
of ﬁnancial interventions to address sex-based disparities.18

Healthcare affordability and mortality in adults with liver disease
Indeed, ﬁnancial incentives in the form of conditional cash
transfers or medical service vouchers targeted towards low-
income women in the general population for reproductive and
maternal health have been shown to improve health outcomes
and bridge sex-based disparities.52 Finally, the increased like-
lihood of ﬁnancial distress in adults with liver disease in the US
Census Southern region may be secondary to the low density
of primary care providers53 and gastroenterologists54 in this
region, leading to late-stage presentation of liver disease and
increased high-cost healthcare utilisation (i.e. hospitalisations
for acute events vs. outpatient care for preventive care) and
thus to ﬁnancial distress. Potentially broadening the coverage
of services, minimising copayments, and increasing eligibility
for government-sponsored insurance may aid in decreasing
ﬁnancial distress in these vulnerable subpopulations. In addi-
tion, novel methods of disseminating care (e.g. telehealth) has
been shown to decrease economic losses related to travel and
productivity loss not only for patients but also for caregivers
within the cancer population and could potentially be useful in
adults with liver disease.55 Furthermore, we hypothesise that
centralised digitised electronic medical records could increase
efﬁciency, decrease healthcare costs, and streamline care de-
livery, thus reducing the ﬁnancial burden and delays in care
incurred by the patient.56 Our results should provide the
impetus
for
prospective
studies
to
examine
the
causal
mechanisms of these associations to better inform tar-
geted interventions.
Among adults with liver disease, diabetes was associated
with healthcare affordability issues, potentially reﬂecting high
out-of-pocket costs garnered from medications to treat dia-
betes, as previously shown in the general population.57–61 In-
terventions to alleviate ﬁnancial distress in this population are
of particular interest, given the correlation of decreased medi-
cation adherence with increased out-of-pocket costs and the
resultant increased healthcare utilisation.62,63 Using generic
formulations when feasible could potentially reduce annual out-
of-pocket
costs
by
82%
for
patients
with
diabetes.64
Adherence-contingent rebates, an effective intervention for
increasing medication adherence in other populations with
chronic diseases,65 may prove to be an effective strategy for
adults with diabetes and liver disease. Finally, multidisciplinary
integrative care models, allowing for alignment and collabora-
tion within the medical home, have been associated with a 40%
improvement in medication adherence for adults with diabetes
alone and may be particularly effective in adults with both liver
disease and diabetes.66 Interestingly, diabetes did not signiﬁ-
cantly increase the likelihood of needing but not obtaining
medical care (aOR 1.06, p = 0.54), suggesting that adults car-
rying a diagnosis of liver disease and diabetes (e.g. with non-
alcoholic fatty liver disease) are potentially more likely to have
established medical care to aid in accessing services or with
less acuity of disease that allows more time for appropriate
healthcare access. Indeed, prior studies have highlighted that
the majority of patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease are
asymptomatic and are diagnosed incidentally.67,68 In contrast,
both former and current alcohol use were risk factors for
healthcare affordability issues and delays in medical care,
suggesting that this group may not be as established in the
medical system, as supported by data showing that patients
with alcohol-associated liver disease often have late presen-
tation of disease and increased healthcare utilisation.68,69
Community-based alcohol use screening and interventions
may be of beneﬁt to increase early identiﬁcation of adults at risk
and increase uptake of preventive cost-saving care.
There were limitations to this study. First, the survey struc-
ture is self-report, so the prevalence of liver disease and cases
of ﬁnancial distress are potentially underreported, and variables
are at risk for misclassiﬁcation (including liver cancer potentially
representing metastatic cancer to the liver) and response bias.
Nonetheless, the NHIS has been administered nationally for
over 50 years with careful selection of questions from validated
survey instruments, and we hypothesise that we have captured
adults with clinically diagnosed liver disease, which may be
more relevant to real-world practice. Second, causal inference
is inherently limited in this observational study owing to lack of
randomisation. Although our multivariable models adjust for
speciﬁc confounders in an attempt to maximise causal infer-
ence, residual confounding is possible and may account for
some of the observed effects of ﬁnancial distress on mortality;
thus, the true effect may be smaller. Third, our results are based
on a US population, and its generalisability to other countries,
speciﬁcally in socialised healthcare systems, would need to be
assessed. Fourth, we could not assess different stages of liver
disease, comorbidities, or other factors of interest, such as
granular social determinants of health (e.g. insurance type),
which will be important areas for future prospective studies.
Fifth, although we attempted to control for factors that could
impact ﬁnancial distress, limitations regarding data collection
for alcohol use precluded further analyses evaluating the
impact of high-risk vs. low-risk drinking. Finally, there are
varying levels of ﬁnancial distress related to healthcare, ranging
from mild budgetary trade-offs to crippling medical debt, the
spectrum of which could not be fully evaluated with our data
sources. To address this limitation, we did use various sub-
categories of healthcare unaffordability that have been vali-
dated as useful metrics by previous literature, but given the
importance and understudied area of ﬁnancial burden among
patients with liver disease, we propose that additional ques-
tions in datasets regarding severity of ﬁnancial distress
be implemented.
The strengths of our study include the use of a nationally
representative cohort to better identify potential risk factors
associated with ﬁnancial distress in liver disease. Data from
2004 to 2018, given the landmark passage of the Affordable
Care Act in 2010, allows assessment of trends and improved

understanding of the evolving landscape of ﬁnancial distress in
the USA. Finally, comparison groups of other chronic medical
conditions provide context for our ﬁndings within the entire
scope of medicine to prioritise higher-level policy changes and
guide healthcare expenditure.
In summary, our study shows that adults with liver disease
face more ﬁnancial distress compared with adults without
liver disease and adults with cancer history or coronary artery
disease in the USA. The prevalence of ﬁnancial distress has
decreased since the Affordable Care Act enactment but per-
sists at high levels and is associated with a 24% increased risk
of mortality among adults with liver disease. These ﬁndings
should encourage medical professionals to screen for ﬁnancial
distress in patients diagnosed with liver disease and provide
impetus to policymakers to improve healthcare accessibility
and affordability targeted to adults with liver disease.

Healthcare disparities
Shondell V Hickson
Abstract
The structure of the healthcare system has a profound impact on
patient care and their health outcomes, especially among racial and
ethnic minority groups. Structural and systemic barriers are crucial in
shaping health disparities and inequities, with various components
exacerbating or mitigating the problem. Research on this subject
has grown exponentially into a multifaceted ﬁeld. In the past 20
years, The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ)
has published annual reports with measurable trends related to
accessibility, affordability, coordination, effective treatment, healthy
living, patient safety, and person-centered care. Focusing on the
challenges plaguing underserved populations is essential to achieve
meaningful progress in addressing health care disparities.
Keywords Health care providers; health care systems; health
disparities; health equity; social determinants of health
Introduction
Healthy People 2030 deﬁnes a health disparity as “a particular
type of health difference that is linked with social, economic, and
environmental disadvantage” and that adversely affects groups
of people who have systematically experienced more signiﬁcant
obstacles to health (“Healthy People 2030,” n.d.).1 Healthcare
disparities gained recognition over three decades with the Report
of the Secretary’s Task Force on Black and Minority Health. This
report was called the Heckler Report, published in 1985. It
documented persistent health disparities that accounted for
60,000 excess deaths yearly and synthesized ways to advance
health equity (Heckler, 1985).2 The Heckler Report led to the
creation of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services
Ofﬁce of Minority Health. It inﬂuenced federal recognition of and
investment in many aspects of health equity, including food in-
securities, access to healthcare, inclusive communities, and
racial and ethnic disparities.2 Another landmark study by the
Institute of Medicine (IOM), done at the request of Congress,
provided evidence that race and ethnicity correlated to the
quality of healthcare received and positive health outcomes
(Capps, 2003).3 Common trends in disparities result from struc-
tural and systemic factors that create unequal opportunities and
outcomes for different groups of people, often associated with
race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, gender, age, disability,
sexual orientation, and geographic location (Agency for Health-
care Quality and Disparities reports, n.d.).4
The most notable healthcare disparity is access to healthcare
(Anderson & Wolski, 2023).5 Access to healthcare includes more
than geographic location; it impacts patients who need specialty
care, transportation, healthcare costs, and specialized treatment
facilities. The scenario highlights common reasons for access to
care.
Scenario: access to care
Khadijah Johnson is a 46-year-old African-American female
living in a remote village in Mississippi. She is pregnant and has
a high risk due to a recent miscarriage. The local clinic in her
area has a limited healthcare infrastructure and a shortage of
high-risk obstetrical specialist healthcare providers. The nearest
urban center with comprehensive medical facilities is approxi-
mately 2 hours away, resulting in challenges for Kadijah to seek
specialized healthcare services.
Kadijah’s limited access to healthcare requires a multifaceted
approach, including improving access, increasing culturally
competent
care,
expanding
insurance
coverage,
recruiting
specialized health providers, and implementing targeted outreach
and education programs. These efforts ensure that healthcare
services are accessible and equitable for all communities, regard-
less of socioeconomic status, race, or cultural background
(Abraham et al., 2021) (see Figure 1).6
Another evidence-based intervention to address health dis-
parities is the promotion of health equity. Health equity occurs
when everyone has a fair and just opportunity to attain their best
health (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2023).7 It
should be ongoing, collaborative, and responsive to different
populations and their communities’ unique needs. Addressing
this disparity dismantles systemic inequalities, and patients can
strive toward a more equitable and inclusive healthcare system
that beneﬁts everyone (Ndugga & Artiga, 2023).8
Economic stability disparity
Socioeconomic status (SES) is critical in shaping health dispar-
ities and inﬂuencing patient’s well-being. SES of health are the
conditions in the environments where people are born, live,
learn, work, play, worship, and age that affect a wide range of
health, functioning, and quality-of-life outcomes and risks
(“Healthy People 2030,” n.d.).9 Individuals with a lower SES may
face barriers to accessing healthcare due to ﬁnancial constraints
or lack of health insurance. Compared to higher-income in-
dividuals who can access better healthcare, afford healthier food
options, and live in safer neighborhoods. Economic stability is

essential for overall well-being. Understanding these relation-
ships is essential for addressing health inequities and designing
policies and interventions to improve the health of disadvan-
taged populations (Hill-Briggs et al., 2020).10
Racial and ethnic minorities disparity
Racial and ethnic minorities often experience signiﬁcant dispar-
ities in healthcare, which can lead to differences in disease
prevalence, treatment outcomes, and access to quality care.
These disparities result from various factors, including discrim-
ination, historical inequities, and socioeconomic factors. Addi-
tionally, some racial and ethnic groups may have genetic
predispositions to certain types of cancer as a result of environ-
mental factors, such as exposure to carcinogens, diet, and life-
style choices. African-American men are more likely to die from
colorectal cancer than Caucasian men (Hill-Briggs et al., 2020).11
Caucasian women are more likely to develop breast cancer, but
African-American women are more likely to die from this
particular form of cancer (Hill-Briggs et al., 2020).11
Gender disparity
Addressing gender and age-related healthcare disparities in-
volves improving access to care, promoting preventive services,
and enhancing healthcare provider education and cultural
competence (Kong et al., 2020).12 Additionally, raising aware-
ness about these disparities and advocating for equitable
healthcare is essential to ensure all individuals receive the care
they need regardless of gender or age. Healthcare policies and
interventions should be tailored to the speciﬁc needs of these
groups to reduce disparities and promote equitable access to
healthcare services at all stages of life.
Health education disparity
Lack of health education and awareness can contribute to dis-
parities in cancer outcomes. Educational programs focusing on
cancer prevention, early detection, and healthy behaviors are
essential for reducing these disparities. By addressing barriers
and implementing effective educational programs, we can
empower adolescents with the knowledge and skills to make
informed choices, reduce cancer risks, and lead healthier lives.
Reducing adolescent cancer risk can signiﬁcantly impact long-
term health and well-being (Abraham et al., 2021).6
Healthcare system disparity
People without health insurance or inadequate coverage may
delay or forgo necessary healthcare services, leading to dispar-
ities in health outcomes. Health insurance ensures access to
medical care (Kaiser Family Foundation, 2023).13 Addressing
healthcare disparities is a complex and long-term endeavor that
requires a multifaceted approach involving policy changes,
public health initiatives, and cultural shifts in the healthcare
system. The goal is to ensure that all individuals have equal
access to healthcare services and the opportunity to achieve
optimal health outcomes. Healthcare systemsean organization of
people, institutions, and resources that delivers healthcare ser-
vices to meet the health needs of target populations.
Geographic location and food insecurity disparity
People in remote or underserved regions may have difﬁculty
accessing timely and appropriate care. In some rural areas,
healthcare resources are often scarce, and patients may experi-
ence healthcare disparities due to limited access to healthcare
facilities and specialized services. Efforts to address these bar-
riers are essential to ensuring rural residents have equitable ac-
cess to healthcare services and can obtain the care they need to
maintain their health and well-being (“Healthcare access in rural
communities overview,” n.d.).9
In some communities, food insecurities may impact the
community’s health. The United States Department of Agricul-
ture (USDA) deﬁnes food insecurity as limited or inadequate
Figure 1 A multifaceted approach to health disparities.

access to healthy food options to live an active and healthy life
(“Measurement,” 2023).14 The environment, neighbor infra-
structure, accessibility, and cost signiﬁcantly inﬂuence food
insecurity. On the contrary, when residents lack access to
affordable, healthy foods are known as food deserts. “Food
insecurity, which affects an estimated 15 million Americans, is
the limited or uncertain availability of safe and nutritionally
adequate foods, or the limited or uncertain ability to acquire
acceptable foods in socially acceptable ways” (Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention 2023).7 Family food insecurity is
higher in minority populations and patients with disabilities.
The lack of nutritious resources creates barriers for patients with
existing health conditions such as diabetes and hypertension.
Improving food insecurities includes community engagement
with local health and food programs to assist with nutrition
education, food access, and intake. Providing ﬁnancial assis-
tance for patients to purchase food, such as the Supplemental
Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and the Special Supple-
mental Nutritional Program for Women, Infants, and Children
(WIC) (Taylor et al., 2018).15
Conclusion
Addressing healthcare disparities is a complex and long-term
endeavor that requires a multifaceted approach involving pol-
icy changes, public health initiatives, and cultural shifts in the
healthcare system. Access to essential resources, such as healthy
food, safe housing, and transportation, is crucial in improving
health disparities. Evidence has shown that people with limited
access to these resources may struggle to maintain a healthy
lifestyle and manage chronic conditions. Efforts to address
healthcare disparities must encompass comprehensive health-
care reform, including expanding health insurance coverage,
improving healthcare infrastructure, increasing access to primary
care, and fostering health equity.

1. Introduction and motivation 
Since its 1995 implementation, Taiwan’s National Health Insurance 
(NHI) system has made significant progress while also facing challenges. 
It receives both acclaim and critique in international comparisons [1,2], 
[1,2] especially in the quality and outcomes of healthcare [3–5]. The 
NHI system persistently enjoys a very high population satisfaction rate: 
often70% −80%, and above 90% since 2020 [6,7]. Yet there is 
increasing dissatisfaction from providers, especially around low nurses’ 
salaries, physicians’ long working hours, and the slow inclusion of new 
pharmaceuticals among its covered drugs [8]. During the 2023–2024 
Presidential election campaign, NHI system reform was also a conten­
tious agenda among candidates. 
As debates on the future of Taiwan’s NHI system continue, a resur­
facing issue is the expansion of the private financing of Taiwan’s 
healthcare system. Options under consideration include opening stand- 
alone private health insurance, expanding supplemental private health 
insurance, or increasing the private payment options. The same issue 
was hotly debated only three years after the implementation of the NHI 
system, with at least five legislative proposals in 1999 [9]. 
Our motivation in this review is to critically examine these debates 
and consider the future of Taiwan’s NHI system. We intend to add a new 
voice to this debate providing a different critical perspective by 
considering the NHI through the lens of social institutions. We will begin 
by introducing the ethical and normative assumptions of our analytical 
framework, followed by a discussion of the ecology of Taiwan’s NHI 
system and its strengths, weaknesses, and future challenges. We 
conclude with proposals for how the system may be strengthened to 
achieve its goals. 
2. Analytical framework and ethical and normative assumptions 
Any assessment of a national healthcare system and its goals is 
normative. A society may choose from a wide range of potential goals. 
The goals chosen determine the distribution of benefits and costs, 
resulting in “winners and losers” within the system. No scientific or 
objective method offers guidance on who should win or lose, hence the 
nature of such analyses is normative. Ideally, national health systems 
possess explicitly stated goals that can provide a focus for investigation. 
Taiwan’s National Health Insurance Act stated only a vague goal, in 
Article 1: “The purpose of implementing the National Health Insurance 
Program is to promote the health of nationals” [10]. While this provided 
some direction, it did not provide an explicit ethical foundation, such as 
the principle of distributive justice, to guide the system in identifying 
more specific goals beyond “promoting the health of nationals”. 
Consequently, we must identify and outline our own normative goals for 
the purpose of this review. 
An essential step in normative research is to explicitly present one’s 
underlying normative and ethical assumptions. In this case, the nature of 
a healthcare system is one vital assumption. Most studies in the health 
field tend to treat the healthcare system as an industry, not much 
different from other industries that include suppliers and consumers. 
Implicit in such a framework is the conventional market analysis and 
related tools; patients are “consumers” and healthcare providers are

“suppliers”. Such a framework is popular in some of the current debates 
about Taiwan’s NHI system [8]. 
Our framework differs markedly from this perspective and shares 
Mooney’s position that the healthcare system should be regarded not as 
an industry but as a social institution [11]. A key function of social 
institutions is to stimulate people’s awareness of the institutions in 
which they participate. This is an important step towards feeling at 
home in the institution and, eventually, feeling ownership of the insti­
tution [12]. Social institutions, further, are vital in enhancing the sense 
of community and freedom. Besides promoting population health, the 
national healthcare system also contributes to achieving “a better, more 
decent society” (Mooney 2012:150) and serves as an important pillar of 
society. 
We highlight the key differences in framing the healthcare system as 
an industry versus a social institution in Table 1. We also summarize the 
implications of four key ethical and normative values we hold which 
underlie our assessment of any national health system’s success.  
(1). Human dignity calls for equal regard of every citizen and 
resident. 
(2). Self-determination calls for transparent, inclusive, and demo­
cratic governance of the system.  
(3). Communitarian ethics calls for solidarity in supporting and 
strengthening population health, with equitable access to ser­
vices and equitable distribution of financial burden [13].  
(4) Distributive justice calls for equitable access to services and 
equitable distribution of financial burden. 
We discuss the rationale for choosing these four ethical values as our 
normative foundation for identifying the goals of a national health 
system in the following. Human dignity and self-determination are 
widely accepted already as ethical foundations in the field of population 
health. The European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights stated in its 
Article 1: 
“The dignity of the human person is not only a fundamental right in 
itself but constitutes the real basis of fundamental rights.” [14] 
Human dignity grounds modern conceptions (and legal expressions) 
of human rights [15], which in turn provide an ethical argument for 
universal healthcare. The related concept of self-determination was 
largely developed and codified into a right by the United Nations 
beginning in the 1940s. [15] Its significance to the field is demonstrated 
by its inclusion in the WHO’s 1978 Declaration of Alma Ata, the text of 
which clearly articulates values of self-reliance and self-determination. 
[16] In 2013 the United Nations General Assembly declared 
self-determination to be integral to basic human rights and fundamental 
freedoms: 
“It is only through the realization of this very basic right of people to 
determine, with no compulsion or coercion, their own future, po­
litical status and independence that we can begin to address others 
such as dignity, justice, progress and equity.” [17] 
These past articulations of the necessity of human dignity and self- 
determination to the possibility for health and well-being motivated us 
to select them as fundamental ethical values for assessing a national 
health system. 
Communitarian ethics was chosen as a core ethical value for 
assessment because it “… acknowledges and values, and not just instru­
mentally, the bonds that unite and identify communities. Communitarians 
value community per se.” [18] 
Further, communitarian ethics argues that an individual is valued as 
both an individual and a member of a community. It provides the 
foundation to state that “… health care ceases to be an individualistic 
normal good but becomes a community good.” [18] 
Finally, communitarian ethics is closely allied with a fourth ethical 
principle, distributive justice, which is relevant for assessing a national 
health system’s ability to distribute goods to the benefit of the entire 
community. In thinking of the allocation of health care services, we 
focus on distributive justice’s principle of equal access for equal needs. 
This means people with equal health needs should have equal access to 
health care. In relation to the financial burden of health care, distribu­
tive justice incorporates the ability to pay principle. That is, an in­
dividual’s or family’s financial burden in healthcare should reflect their 
income (ability to pay). 
In this essay, we examine Taiwan’s NHI system through the lens of a 
social institution and grounded in these ethical values. This framework 
guided us to outline the system’s goals as.  
(1) promoting population health, with:  
(2) equitable access to healthcare under the equal access for equal 
need principle,  
(3) equitable financial burden of healthcare under the ability to pay 
principle,  
(4) equitable improvement of healthcare quality, 
(5) an open, inclusive, and democratic governance under the com­
munity ownership principle,  
(6) efficient and sustainable investment of resources, and  
(7) contributing to a better society, defined as social solidarity and 
maintaining the willingness to share resources and caring 
capacity. 
We discuss how these goals are related to or grounded by these four 
ethical values in Table 2. 
These goals position Taiwan’s citizens and residents as the NHI’s 
owners rather than consumers. Further, given that “equitable” and 
“efficient” are also normative concepts, our goals related to them are 
grounded in communitarian ethics and distributive justice values we 
identified. 
Although the social institution framework does not include an 
explicit ethical demand to consider providers, it does call for inclusion of 
all stakeholders. It is therefore, the strength of the social institution 
framework to regard healthcare providers as members of the community 
who contribute to the improvement of population health. A healthcare 
system cannot achieve its goals without treating them justly. Their 
contributions, therefore, should be rewarded equitably, and their labors 
and expertise not exploited. 
3. The ecology of Taiwan’s NHI system 
One approach to examining the NHI’s role in Taiwan’s healthcare 
ecosystem is its proportion of total national health expenditure (NHE). 
In 2021, NHI expenditures contributed 51.4 % of the NHE, while 
household out-of-pocket (OOP) expenses contributed 29.3%, the Min­
istry of Health and Welfare (MOHW) contributed 7.9 %, and other 
government agencies contributed 2.9 % [19]. The public sector 
accounted for 62.2% of the NHE, which suggests that the state, espe­
cially the NHI system, has substantial leverage in shaping Taiwan’s 
healthcare delivery ecosystem. Under the global budget system,

however, providers enjoy some level of autonomous accountability. 
With the negotiated national expenditure cap, the responsibility for 
providers’ financial burden and resource allocation was delegated to the 
hospitals’ and physicians’ associations. The differential powers between 
hospitals and clinics have profoundly shaped Taiwan’s delivery system 
to favor large teaching or medical center hospitals. This is also reflected 
in the distribution of healthcare expenditure, where hospitals took the 
lion’s share, 44.6%, of 2021 NHE. In the same year, 37.9% of the NHE 
was for outpatient services (excluding dentistry) and 19.1% was for 
inpatient services. Within outpatient services, hospitals claimed 67.3 % 
of the expenditure [19]. Numerous attempts have been made to divert 
primary care from hospitals to clinics, including increasing cost-sharing 
for hospital outpatient care, but these initiatives have not been suc­
cessful so far. Between 2011 and 2021, hospital outpatient expenditure 
increased from 33.2% to 37.2% of total personal healthcare, while the 
clinic’s share declined from 20.2% to 18 % [19]. 
The implementation of the NHI inadvertently contributed to further 
concentration of healthcare resources in large hospitals while weak­
ening primary care. Weakened primary care capacity in Taiwan 
contributed to the uneven distribution of healthcare during the 
pandemic, which overburdened the hospitals [20]. It also shifted the 
care of chronic diseases to major hospitals, away from the primary care 
system which usually is more efficient and accessible for an aging 
population. 
4. Strengths and weaknesses 
In this section, we consider Taiwan’s NHI system against the seven 
goals listed in the second section. Since our chosen framework is neither 
mainstream nor popular, empirical evidence is often scarce.  
(1) promoting population health 
The NHI system significantly improved Taiwan’s population health, 
especially during its first decade. Between 1990 and 2017, Taiwan 
substantially reduced disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) rates by a 
quarter, though progress has slowed and stagnated recently. Recent 
empirical and international comparisons of population health have not 
been flattering for Taiwan. Taiwan ranked 45th in a global healthcare 
outcome comparison measured by the Healthcare Access and Quality 
(HAQ) Index [3]. Using the broader Sustainable Development Goals 
Index or the more narrow Universal Health Coverage Index, Taiwan 
ranked 38th in 2018 and 37th in 2020 [4,5]. Nearly half of Taiwan’s 
disease burden is due to modifiable risk factors like high fasting plasma 
glucose, obesity, alcohol, drug use, and impaired kidney function [21]. 
This suggests that Taiwan’s NHI and healthcare system has ample room 
for improvement in promoting population health by strengthening its 
primary care services to address these factors, improve chronic disease 
management, and prevent deaths amenable to healthcare intervention. 
There are many possible indicators of measuring “population 
health.” Besides the popular Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALY) and the 
Disability-Adjusted Life Years, there is also the “deaths amenable to 
healthcare” indicator that is very sensitive to national healthcare sys­
tems. [22] The choice of a population health indicator, once again, is a 
normative choice. Guided by the value of community ownership, we 
recommend that Taiwan’s Ministry of Health and Welfare conduct a 
deliberative method (such as a citizens jury) to obtain from Taiwan’s 
citizens and residents the preferred indicators for Taiwan.  
(2) equitable access to healthcare 
Few studies address horizontal equity of access to healthcare (“equal 
treatment for equal needs”) in Taiwan. Lu et al. (2007) found that 
wealthier individuals were slightly more likely to use outpatient ser­
vices, whereas the distribution of dental, emergency room (ER) visits, 
and inpatient admissions were either proportional or modestly pro-poor 
[23]. Lee and Lu (2013) studied children aged 12 and under, discovering 
a pro-rich pattern in visits to allopathic physicians and ER visits, largely 
influenced by the caregiver’s education and household income. Hospital 
admissions showed similar patterns across income groups [24]. These 
findings underscore the need for policy interventions to address the 
unequal distribution of outpatient services, particularly among 
lower-income children [24]. Chu and Lawana (2021) analyzed health 
check-up utilization in 2009, finding slight pro-rich tendencies for both 
men and women, with greater income-related inequality among men 
[25]. 
Evidence on vertical equity of access to healthcare in Taiwan is 
scarce. Wang and Yaung (2013) found a pro-need distribution across all 
service types, including outpatient, emergency, and inpatient, except for 
preventive services, which were less related to health needs [26]. 
In addition, there are still challenges to equity in access to healthcare 
among minority populations. For example, Lee et al. (2019) found the 
indigenous Taiwanese population often has “coverage without access” and 
suggested policy recommendations for improving access to health care 
[27].  
(3) equitable financial burden of healthcare 
Some evidence supports the conclusion that Taiwan’s NHI distributes 
the financial burden of healthcare in a pro-poor manner. Huang et al. 
analyzed data from 1996 to 2000 and found the lowest income group 
experienced the highest net benefits (NT$3353) and the top income 
group received the lowest net benefits (−NT$3072) in 1996 [28]. Pu 
et al. (2023) computed the concentration index (CI) using 2022 house­
hold OOP data, revealing a pro-rich distribution (CI = 0.103, P < 0.05) 
[29]. The financial burden on individuals remains substantial. In 2021, 
Taiwan’s OOP constituted 31.5% of the current NHE, surpassing the

Ethical Values as a Foundation for the 
Goal 
1. Promoting population health 
(1) Human dignity 
Note that this was the only explicit goal of 
Taiwan’s National Health Insurance 
system that was included in the National 
Health Insurance Act Article 1. Since this 
essay is assessing Taiwan’s NHI, it is 
essential to include this goal. 
2. Equitable access to healthcare under 
the equal access for equal need

5. An open, inclusive, and democratic 
governance under community 
ownership principle 
(1) Human dignity 
(2) Self-determination 
6. Efficient and sustainable investment 
of resources 
(3) Communitarian ethics 
(4) Distributive justice 
This goal was derived from the first goal, 
as any national health system always faces 
limited resources. To effectively promote 
population health, by nature, the system 
has to be efficient and sustainable. 
Because “efficient” is a normative 
concept, our notion of efficiency is also 
framed by these two ethical principles. 
7. Contributing to a better society, 
defined as social solidarity and 
maintaining the willingness to share 
resources and caring capacity 
(1) Human dignity 
(3) Communitarian ethics 
In addition, this goal is also grounded in 
the framework regarding healthcare 
system as a social institution  
C. Chi et al.

OECD average of 18.5% [19,30]. This share was similar to an earlier 
finding [31]. Chen and Chung (2016) observed a positive income 
gradient in personal health expenditure among individuals aged 65 and 
over, largely stemming from OOP and supplemental insurance [32]. 
The equity of tax financing poses a challenge for Taiwan’s NHI. The 
NHI employs a dual-track system comprising ‘regular premiums’ which is 
an earmarked payroll tax with a cap, and ‘supplementary premiums’ 
which is an earmarked non-payroll extra-income tax from dividends and 
interest, etc. Although this tax slightly reduced the regressivity in the tax 
burden, NHI taxes remain regressive [33]. Additionally, horizontal 
inequity (individuals with the same ability to pay bear different financial 
burden) has inadvertently intensified, as households with identical in­
comes but different income sources face varying tax burdens. Conse­
quently, some scholars advocate for a household income-based tax 
system, which could significantly enhance tax burden equity [34]. 
Further, Taiwan’s rapid population aging and wage stagnation among 
younger generations have exacerbated intergenerational inequality, 
disproportionately increasing the NHI financial burden on younger in­
dividuals [35].  
(4) equitable improvement of healthcare quality 
Chen et al. (2007) found that Taiwan’s NHI significantly increased 
outpatient and inpatient care utilization among the elderly, while dis­
parities in healthcare quality persisted [36]. Hsiao and Cheng (2013) 
found patients with lower education were less likely to be admitted to a 
hospital according to a planned schedule and be treated at tertiary 
hospitals [37]. However, there are no differences in the quality of hos­
pital care as reported by patients, regardless of their socio-economic 
status [37]. Yu et al. (2016) reported that urban residents and 
higher-income patients tend to receive care from better-performing 
providers, highlighting the need for policies to address these in­
equalities in coronary artery bypass surgery outcomes [38]. Hsieh et al. 
(2023) also reported geographical disparities in mortality rates across 
Taiwanese townships, noting a negative correlation between primary 
care physician density and all-cause and cardiovascular disease mor­
tality [39]. The redistributive effects of the NHI on individual health 
outcomes merit further exploration.  
(5) open, inclusive, and democratic governance 
Taiwan’s NHI is governed by the National Health Insurance Com­
mittee (NHIC) under the MOHW [40]. Its main tasks are to review and 
approve NHI financing expenditure global budget, to solicit public 
opinions, and to prepare an annual report that is available to the public. 
Because the NHIC is under the MOHW’s jurisdiction, and its members 
are appointed by the MOHW, its independence and representativeness 
may be questioned. A more democratic and inclusive governance 
structure could structure the NHIC as an independent Commission not 
under any ministry, with publicly elected members whose tasks include 
routine gathering and compiling of public preferences related to key NHI 
policies such as tax rate, cost-sharing, and coverage, etc. Moreover, to 
promote inclusive governance, the members of the governance structure 
should adequately represent the social demographic characteristics of 
Taiwan’s society so that diverse voices are included in making key 
decisions. 
One key weakness of current NHI governance is the absence of an 
explicit resource allocation principle grounded in a distributive justice 
principle supported by Taiwanese society. Consequently, the NHI’s 
policies are often the ad hoc result of power politics in which groups with 
louder voices have successfully claimed more resources. Systematic 
healthcare priority-setting is vital to resolving current debates on 
whether and how much to increase tax financing and where to invest in 
the national healthcare system [41]. The Grand Justices of Judicial Yuan 
also declared these shortcomings to be violations of the constitutional 
principle of protecting people’s fundamental rights [42]. 
Various methods exist for engaging the public to obtain representa­
tive values in distributive justice and preferences for key decisions in 
national healthcare. Examples include discrete choice experiments 
(DCE) [43], multi-criteria decision analyses [44], citizen’s jury (CJ) [13, 
45,46], and civic group forums [47]. Schoon and Chi (2022) demon­
strated an innovative method of integrating the DCE and CJ method 
[48], and empirically tested it using Taiwan’s NHI as the context [49]. 
Nú˜
nez (2021) also developed an innovative survey method to obtain the 
public values of healthcare priority in Chile [50]. These are methods that 
Taiwan could consider implementing to obtain social values and pref­
erences of the NHI system and strengthen its community governance.  
(6) efficient and sustainable investment of resources 
Taiwan’s NHI faces significant challenges in financial sustainability 
due to an aging population and fast-emerging medical technologies. To 
curb the rapid increase in health expenditures, the NHI employs mo­
nopsony power through a global budget system, augmented by extensive 
monitoring and review of provider and patient encounters [51]. Still, the 
NHI has periodically encountered financial crises [52]. These crises have 
sparked the rapid growth of private supplemental insurance covering 
services not fully included in the NHI and led to concerns about the 
potential compromise of equity this may entail [51]. Facing this chal­
lenge, there are also voices calling for a two-tier financing system, in 
which the NHI would continue to cover all essential health services 
while opening up private financing mechanisms for those who are able 
and willing to pay [8]. 
A universal healthcare system’s sustainability includes financial and 
social-political dimensions. Society’s willingness to share resources and 
solidarity could be undermined by increasing private finance such as 
expanding supplemental health insurance (SHI) or OOPs [52]. 
Although health system efficiency encompasses a larger scope than 
the NHI, the responsibility of the NHI for deficiencies calls for further 
investigation. Further, the allocative efficiency of a healthcare system is 
a normative concept that requires society to reach a consensus in a 
democratic governance process [53,54].  
(7) contributing to a better society 
There is very little published research on the contribution of Tai­
wan’s NHI towards social solidarity because few researchers or policy­
makers have considered the role of NHI as a social institution. One study 
found that most Taiwanese share a notion of mutual relationship which 
justifies the obligations of mutual aid imposed by the NHI. It also found 
that government performance, decision-making stability, and personal 
experiences were key factors in users’ supportive attitudes [55]. In 
another study Yeh and Chen (2020) found an ethos of common life that 
was shaped by NHI-influenced social values as a key factor contributing 
to social solidarity, which may help the NHI endure prolonged sus­
tainability crises [56]. Anyone interested in the NHI’s sustainability 
cannot afford to ignore its role as a vital institution for social solidarity. 
5. Conclusions - future challenges and how to respond 
A national health system is an extremely complex system with 
multiple subsystems that interact synergistically to shape the system and 
the population’s health. An NHI system is a subsystem of the national 
health system. With predominantly public finance it can have a pro­
found impact on the national health system and population health. The 
Chinese idiom, “Pulling a hair may affect the whole system” (牽一髮而動全 
局), is a very pertinent expression of this complexity. For example, when 
the reimbursement method for physicians is changed, often chains of 
effects follow. 
Based on our review in the last section, we make the following policy 
recommendations. They include only recommendations for the “forest.” 
If the society agrees to these values to guide its goals, there is enough

talent among Taiwan’s healthcare policymakers and administrators to 
develop effective policies to address individual trees and branches.  
(1) Governance 
The NHI should improve the transparency and independence of 
governance with systematic and inclusive public participation. Social 
consensus on distributive justice within the NHI system is vital for 
determining what goals the people want and for developing a systematic 
institutional mechanism of priority setting accordingly. The identified 
distributive justice principle and the goals of the NHI system will guide 
Taiwan’s healthcare system to choose appropriate indicators for popu­
lation health, equity in access to healthcare, equity in financial burden, 
and equity in improvement of healthcare quality.  
(2) Finance  
1) Based on (1), the NHI should identify additional resources and 
investments in the health system needed to achieve NHI goals, 
and  
2) develop an equitable public financing mechanism to generate 
the additional revenue required for the NHI to meet its goals, 
while  
3) improving the reimbursement system derived from the 
strengthened governance in (1) for providers.  
(3) Health Services Delivery 
The NHI should reform and strengthen the healthcare delivery 
system to be efficient in achieving its goals equitably and sus­
tainably. Specifically, it should apply its financing leverage to 
facilitate a healthcare delivery system that is.  
1) pleasant and motivating for providers to work and excel in;  
2) adaptable and innovative to new challenges such as a 
pandemic; 
3) kind (healthcare provider behavior positively supports pa­
tients’ physical, mental, and social well-being) and accessible 
to all populations; and  
4) holistic and efficient in caring for the aging population.  
(4) Resilience, Sustainability, and Social Cement 
Any system reforms should always consider the long-term horizon of 
system resilience, sustainability, equity, and solidarity. Financial sus­
tainability is highly dependent on social sustainability. People’s willing­
ness to share and the sense of solidarity are essential characteristics of 
social cement. 
We offer a cautionary note on the potential impacts of opening 
commercial health insurance that is different from the present SHI. The 
NHI Administration encourages the public to purchase SHI to ease both 
OOPs and the NHI System’s financial burden [57]. Introducing 
stand-alone health insurance could bring challenges from governments 
and commercial health insurance firms abroad to contest the NHI system 
under the General Agreement of Trade in Services (GATS) in the World 
Trade Organization [58,59]. Opening this gate could be irreversible. 
Further, expanding private finance is a slippery slope that may under­
mine the health of the NHI with multiple threats, including by reducing 
the public’s willingness to share and support the NHI or the govern­
ment’s responsibility and ability to promote equity and efficiency. 
Society should proceed with caution. Chile provides an important 
example [60,61]. 
There is no magic bullet solution, our recommendations included, for 
the complex current and future challenges the NHI faces. In a de­
mocracy, open and democratic governance are critical for the society to 
constantly reflect and generate collective consensus on an “ideal” 
healthcare system. Our analysis and recommendations are intended to 
enrich this discourse and process, and we hope this article will stimulate 
the improvement of Taiwan’s NHI governance and expand the horizon 
of what is possible. 
The Primary Health Care (PHC) initiative introduced by the World 
Health Organization (W.H.O.), endorsed by all member states unani­
mously in 1978 World Health Assembly as the core foundation of Health 
for All, was reintroduced by the W⋅H.O. in 2007 [62]. Its values are 
clearly stated: 
“Primary Health Care is essential health care based on practical, scien­
tifically sound and socially acceptable methods and technology made 
universally accessible to individuals and families in the community by 
means acceptable to them, through their full participation and at a cost 
that the community and country can afford … in the spirit of self-reliance 
and self-determination.” 
These values and guiding principles are still relevant 46 years later 
and can serve as a guide for Taiwan’s NHI system and other nations [63]. 
By emphasizing self-determination and community ownership [64], 
when we re-examine the NHI system as a social institution, we may 
envision people in Taiwan achieving ownership of this system and 
enhancing solidarity.

A B S T R A C T   
Purpose: To examine the impact of employment and health insurance on healthcare utilization while delineating 
criminal-legal system (CLS) contact by type. 
Methods: We examined pooled data (2015–2019) from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health to assess the 
association between type of CLS contact (i.e., arrest, probation, or parole) and healthcare utilization (i.e., 
emergency room visit, overnight hospital stays, or doctor visit) among adults aged 18 and older (N = 201,490). 
Results: Adults with any past-year CLS contact reported a higher prevalence of emergency room visits and 
hospital stays, but lower rates of doctor visits, compared to adults with no past-year CLS contact. Findings from 
logistic regression analyses highlight the importance of arrest. Among adults with past-year CLS contact, those 
with an arrest were more likely to report all forms of healthcare utilization compared to those on probation or 
parole. Lastly, findings clearly indicated that insurance was more strongly associated with healthcare utilization 
than employment. 
Discussion: The current research contributes to literature that examines health conditions and healthcare utili­
zation across type of CLS contact. Understanding how barriers to healthcare utilization vary by type of CLS 
contact should enable community resources and support services to reduce health disparities in this vulnerable 
population.   
1. Introduction 
The United States incarcerates around 30% of the world’s inmates as 
of 2023 (Highest to Lowest - Prison Population Tool, 2023). There are 
more than one million Americans currently in prison (Carson, 2020), 
and over 3.7 million on some form of community supervision, such as 
probation or parole (Kaeble, 2023). Importantly, there is a growing body 
of literature that identifies adverse outcomes associated with incarcer­
ation, including poor mental and physical health (Boen, 2020; Dumont 
et al., 2012; Massoglia & Pridemore, 2015). The association with poor 
health extends to other types of contact with the criminal-legal system 
(CLS), including arrest, probation, and parole (Bryson et al., 2021; 
Hawks et al., 2022; Schnittker & John, 2007; Winkelman et al., 2020). 
Given the strong association with poor health, individuals with any CLS 
contact are an important at-risk population with a variety of healthcare 
needs (Farrell & Gottlieb, 2020; Jue et al., 2023). A growing body of 
research highlights how incarceration (Baggio et al., 2019; Fahmy & 
Wallace, 2018) and other types of CLS contact (Farrell & Gottlieb, 2020; 
Hawks et al., 2022; Jue et al., 2023; Winkelman et al., 2016) impact 
healthcare utilization. 
CLS contact creates barriers to address these health conditions 
including access to health insurance and employment (Frank et al., 
2014; Winkelman et al., 2016). Being uninsured is a major barrier to 
accessing healthcare in the US, with research suggesting that the unin­
sured are more likely to access one-time emergency services rather than 
regular primary care visits (Baggio et al., 2019; Farrell & Gottlieb, 2020; 
Olfson et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023). Access to health insurance is 
often provided by an employer, but the Affordable Care Act (ACA) has 
had an impact on insuring unemployed Americans (Benitez et al., 2021). 
Despite the improvements of the ACA, previously incarcerated men still 
disproportionately account for those who are uninsured (Winkelman 
et al., 2017) and other types of CLS contact also serve as barriers to 
employment and access to health insurance (Capece, 2022; Martin et al., 
2020; Sykes et al., 2022). Work has been done to illustrate the connec­
tion between incarceration, poor health, and healthcare utilization, 
however most studies do not consider the impact that different types of 
CLS contact may have on individuals. 
This relationship is further compounded by the impact that

(Massoglia & Pridemore, 2015). Incarceration acts as an impediment to 
social integration through stigma, which impacts the willingness of 
favorable workplaces, such as those that are full time, pay higher wages, 
and offer health insurance benefits, to hire those with criminal back­
grounds (Santos et al., 2023). The stigma related to CLS contact impacts 
healthcare utilization as well and leads to less frequent doctor visits and 
more frequent emergency room and hospital visits (Frank et al., 2014). A 
review conducted by Martin et al. (2020) found that perceived or 
anticipated stigma can impact healthcare utilization such as engagement 
with psychosocial treatment and found that the fears of stigma 
impacting treatment were not unfounded, with healthcare providers 
perception of patient criminality impacting triage and treatment de­
cisions. With data suggesting access to insurance through the workplace 
has an impact on health, it would stand to reason that CLS contact, 
which often acts as a barrier to employment (Wakefield & Uggen, 2010; 
Wheelock et al., 2011), would also be correlated to poor health 
outcomes. 
2. Literature review 
2.1. Employment, insurance, and health 
Prior research has shown that employment has a positive impact on 
health and well-being (Ice et al., 2020; Park et al., 2016; Ross & Mir­
owsky, 1995). Employment is important as it provides access to health 
insurance, other economic benefits, and is associated with social capital 
and social support (Cable et al., 2008; Lourel et al., 2013; Park et al., 
2016). However, the association between employment and health is not 
that simple. Research shows that jobs with inflexible work arrange­
ments, unpredictable scheduling, and high levels of stress and insecurity 
may be associated with poor health outcomes (Chandola et al., 2019; 
D’Souza et al., 2005; Schneider & Harknett, 2019). Additionally, both 
underemployment and unemployment have negative physical or psy­
chological health associations (Anderson & Winefield, 2011; Pratap 
et al., 2021; Sadava et al., 2000; Skinner et al., 2023). The conditions 
linking unemployment and underemployment to poor health outcomes 
seem likely to be exacerbated in a CLS impacted population as a criminal 
record is a major factor in job applicant selection (Agan & Starr, 2017). 
Being insured in the United States has been shown to be related to 
health for a variety of reasons, including increased access to primary 
care and other healthcare services (Olfson et al., 2022; Sommers et al., 
2017). Hoffman and Paradise (2008) cite the link between health in­
surance and poverty in predicting health as primary reasons for the 
health-health insurance link. Most working Americans receive their 
healthcare through their employer and as such, healthcare is tied to 
employment, in turn tying health care to poverty. When one is unin­
sured, they are less likely to access health care (Anderson et al., 2012). 
The health-health insurance link is additionally bolstered in a systemic 
review which examined the causal effect of gaining and losing health 
insurance (Freeman et al., 2008). Through being employed full-time, 
most Americans have access to health insurance and are, in-turn, 
healthier than their uninsured counterparts. 
2.2. CLS contact, employment, and health insurance 
There is a wealth of information to suggest that incarceration, and 
contact with the criminal-legal system in general, has a negative impact 
on employment opportunities (Larson et al., 2022; Sykes et al., 2022; 
Uggen, 2000). In particular, the stigma associated with an arrest and the 
restrictive conditions associated with community supervision serve as 
barriers to employment (Capece, 2022; Mallik-Kane & Visher, 2008; 
Santos et al., 2023). Employment prospects are more abundant before 
incarceration when compared to after, with only 55% of former inmates 
released reporting any income at all after their first year of being 
released (Looney & Turner, 2018). Additionally, the formerly 
incarcerated who have had community sanctions placed upon them 
(parole, probation) have significantly lower job quality compared to 
those who are not on parole or probation (Capece, 2020). This is prob­
lematic as research highlights the importance of job commitment/ 
quality among adults with prior CLS contact (Jaynes, 2022). Other 
studies have supported the link between job quality and community 
sanctions, such as Seim and Harding (2020), who similarly found that 
parole increases the odds of employment but does not help to alleviate 
poverty. By and large, however, these studies also indicate that those 
with community sanctions are less likely to work in general. Seim and 
Harding (2020) point out that underemployment and low-quality 
employment are extremely common for parolees. 
Adults with CLS contact are also less likely to have health insurance 
(Wilper et al., 2009; Winkelman et al., 2016). This is especially impor­
tant as being uninsured has been shown to increase the likelihood of 
reincarceration among those with prior CLS contact (Baggio et al., 
2019). In recent years the Affordable Care Act has significantly 
decreased the rates of being uninsured among the unemployed (Benitez 
et al., 2021), particularly among the formerly incarcerated (Gutierrez & 
Pettit, 2020; Winkelman et al., 2017). This suggests that the Affordable 
Care Act may mitigate the necessity to be employed to access health 
insurance. 
2.3. Current research 
While the link between CLS contact and adverse outcomes, such as 
poor health, is well-established, less research focuses on healthcare 
utilization among this high-risk population. We contribute to this 
growing body of research by examining the association between various 
types of CLS contact (i.e., arrest, probation, parole) and different forms 
of healthcare utilization (i.e., emergency room, hospital, doctor) in a 
large national sample. Prior research has stressed the importance of 
investigating how different types of CLS contact impact health and 
healthcare utilization (Ni˜
no et al., 2023). Additionally, we assess the 
impact of insurance, employment, and health conditions on healthcare 
utilization across types of CLS contact. 
3. Method 
3.1. Data 
The current study used data from the National Survey on Drug Use 
and Health (NSDUH). The NSDUH has a target population of civilians 
aged 12 and older that are not institutionalized and is based on an in­
dependent, multistage area probability sample. The NSDUH is a cross- 
sectional design and data are collected from respondents using a com­
bination of computer-assisted face-to-face interviewing by a trained 
interviewer and computer-assisted self-interviewing. For the current 
study, we pooled multiple years (2015–2019) of NSDUH data and only 
included adult respondents aged 18 or older (N = 201,490). Further 
information regarding the methodology of the NSDUH are available 
elsewhere (Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality, 2020). 
3.2. Measures 
There are three separate dependent variables that assess healthcare 
utilization in the past year, all are coded 0 = No and 1 = Yes. Adult 
respondents were asked (1) if they had been treated in an emergency 
room (ER) for any reason, (2) if they stayed overnight or longer as an 
inpatient in a hospital, and (3) had they visited a doctor, nurse, physi­
cian assistant or nurse practitioner about their own health at a doctor’s 
office, a clinic, or some other place. 
The primary independent variable is a measure of contact with the 
criminal legal system (CLS). Respondents were separated into five 
mutually exclusive categories based on their CLS contact, including no 
lifetime contact (166,801), a lifetime arrest that did not occur in the 
A.H. Lewis and J.A. Ford                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
Journal of Criminal Justice 93 (2024) 102211

past-year (27,077), past-year arrest (3537), past-year probation (2632), 
and past-year parole (1443). For respondents who reported more than 
one type of CLS contact in the past-year, they were categorized based on 
the level of restriction associated with their status. For example, if a 
respondent reported being on both probation and parole, they were 
coded as being on parole given a higher likelihood of prior incarceration. 
Given findings from prior research we were particularly interested in 
how health insurance and employment status were associated with 
healthcare utilization. Health insurance status was categorized as 
insured or uninsured. A respondent was considered to have health in­
surance coverage if they reported having any type, private or public, of 
health insurance in the past year. Current employment status was 
categorized as being employed full-time or part-time versus being un­
employed or not in labor force (e.g., retired, student, homemaker). To 
determine the impact of insurance and employment on healthcare uti­
lization we used these items to create a single categorical measure that 
was coded as being (1) uninsured and unemployed, (2) insured but 
unemployed, (3) uninsured but employed, and (4) insured and 
employed. 
As the likelihood of healthcare utilization increases with various 
health conditions, we included the following measures (all coded no/ 
yes). For mental health, we included major depression (self-reported at 
least five of nine criteria), psychological distress (based on the K6 self- 
report assessment), and suicidal ideation (respondent reported 
thoughts/plans of suicide). For physical health we constructed a mea­
sure of multimorbidity that captured the presence of two or more of the 
following long-term health conditions: heart condition, diabetes, bron­
chitis, cirrhosis, hepatitis, kidney disease, asthma, HIV/AIDS, cancer, 
high blood pressure. Lastly, we included measures of substance use 
disorders, based on DSM-IV criteria, associated with alcohol, marijuana, 
and other illicit drugs. 
Along with survey year, the following control measures were 
included in multivariate analysis. Demographic characteristics included 
respondent’s age (18–25, 26–34, 35–49, 50+), sex (female, male), sex­
ual orientation (heterosexual, gay or lesbian, bisexual), race (white, 
black, Hispanic, other), receiving government assistance (no/yes), size 
of metropolitan area (large metro, small metro, non-metro), educational 
attainment (less than high school, high school graduate, some college, 
college graduate), and marital status (married, widowed, separated/ 
divorced, never married). 
3.3. Analysis 
The analytic strategy involved three different stages. First, sample 
characteristics for all measures were estimated separately for each type 
of criminal-legal system contact. This should provide a basic under­
standing of how healthcare utilization, insurance/employment, and 
health conditions vary across these groups. Second, we wanted to assess 
the likelihood of each type of healthcare utilization across all types of 
CLS contact. To accomplish this, several logistic regression models were 
estimated and the reference category for CLS contact was changed in 
each model. Rather than simply comparing adults with CLS contact to 
those without contact, this strategy allowed us to assess the likelihood of 
healthcare utilization across different types of CLS contact (e.g., arrest 
vs. probation, arrest vs, parole, probation vs. parole). Lastly, we wanted 
to determine the impact of insurance/employment and health condi­
tions on all forms of healthcare utilization across each type of CLS 
contact. To do this we estimated separate logistic regressions for each 
category of CLS contact separately. To account for the complex multi­
stage sampling design of the NSDUH, analyses were conducted using the 
syest and svy commands in STATA 16.0. Given the use of five-years of 
data an adjusted person-level weight was created (i.e., weight/5), per 
guidelines from SAMHSA (Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and 
Quality, 2020). 
4. Results 
4.1. Sample characteristics 
The sample characteristics for all measures are shown in Table 1 by 
type of CLS contact. The overwhelming majority (83.24%) of adults had 
no CLS contact in their lifetime, while 14.05% reported an arrest that did 
not occur in the past-year. Regarding past-year contact 1.19% reported 
an arrest, 0.98% reported being on probation, and 0.54% were on 
parole. A much smaller percentage of adults with no CLS conduct 
(24.63%) reported an ER visit or a hospital stay (9.51%) compared to 
adults with CLS contact. Adults with a past-year arrest reported the 
highest prevalence of both an ER visit (46.63%) and a hospital stay 
(14.77%) compared to those on probation or parole. Alternatively, 
adults with no CLS contact reported the highest prevalence of doctor 
visits (83.14%), while those on parole (65.45%) reported the lowest 
prevalence. Adults with no CLS contact in the past-year reported the

highest prevalence of being both insured and employed, roughly 
57.82%. While only 39.51% of adults with a past-year arrest and 40.78% 
on probation were both insured and employed. Regarding health con­
ditions, adults with past year CLS contact reported a higher prevalence 
of mental health problems, chronic physical conditions, and substance 
use disorders. 
4.2. Healthcare utilization by type of CLS contact 
The findings for twelve separate logistic regression models are shown 
in Table 2 and compare the likelihood of healthcare utilization across 
different types of CLS contact. For ER visits Model 1 utilizes no lifetime 
CLS contact as the reference category. These findings clearly show that 
the likelihood of an ER visit is increased for adults with all types of CLS 
contact. In Model 2, we changed the reference category to lifetime, but 
no past-year, arrest. These findings indicate that the likelihood of an ER 
visit is increased among adults with a past-year arrest and those on 
probation. The findings in Model 3, with past-year arrest as the reference 
category, stand out. The likelihood of an ER visit is decreased for all 
other groups, including those on probation (AOR = 0.71) or parole 
(AOR = 0.67). For hospital visits the findings are similar for adults with 
an arrest, with a decreased likelihood of a hospital stay among adults on 
probation (AOR = 0.63) or parole (AOR = 0.74). The findings for doctor 
visits are different than those for ER and hospital visits, as the likelihood 
of doctor visits is decreased among adults with a lifetime arrest and 
those on probation and parole compared to adults with no CLS contact. 
As with other forms of healthcare utilization, the likelihood of a doctor 
visit was decreased for adults on probation (AOR = 0.78) and parole 
(AOR = 0.75) compared to those with a past-year arrest. The findings in 
Table 2, clearly shows that adults with a past-year arrest are more likely 
to utilize all types of healthcare than those on probation or parole. 
Lastly, there were no significant differences between adults on probation 
and those on parole for any of the healthcare utilization outcomes. 
4.3. CLS contact and emergency room visit 
Findings for the logistic regression analyses with ER visit as the 
dependent variable are shown in Table 3. Compared to adults who were 
both uninsured and unemployed, the likelihood of an ER visit was 
increased for insured only adults with no CLS contact (AOR = 1.28), a 
lifetime arrest (AOR = 1.61), and those on probation in the past-year 
(AOR 1.62). Conversely, adults with no CLS contact (AOR = 0.84) and 
those on parole (AOR = 0.45) who were employed without insurance 
were less likely to report ER visits compared to those who were both 
uninsured and unemployed. There were no significant differences be­
tween uninsured/unemployed adults and adults who were both insured

and employed. 
For adults with no lifetime CLS contact all health conditions signif­
icantly increased the likelihood of an ER visit. All health conditions, 
except alcohol and marijuana substance use disorder increased the 
likelihood of an ER visit for adults with a lifetime arrest. For adults with 
past-year CLS contact fewer health conditions were significantly asso­
ciated with an ER visit, including psychological distress and multi­
morbidity for those with an arrest, psychological distress and other drug 
substance use disorder for those on parole, and depression and alcohol 
substance use disorder for those on parole. 
4.4. CLS contact and overnight hospital stay 
Findings for the logistic regression analyses with hospital stay as the 
dependent variable are shown in Table 4. For adults with no lifetime CLS 
contact (AOR = 1.68), those with a lifetime (AOR = 2.09) or past-year 
arrest (AOR = 2.22) being insured increased the likelihood of a 
hospital visit compared to adults who were both uninsured and unem­
ployed. The likelihood of a hospital visit was decreased for adults who 
were employed without insurance among adults with no lifetime CLS 
contact (AOR = 0.61) or those on probation (AOR = 0.38). Lastly, only 
among adults with no CLS contact was there a significant difference 
between adults who were insured/employed (AOR = 0.86) and those 
who were uninsured/unemployed. 
Several health conditions increased the likelihood of a hospital visit. 
Depression was significant for adults with no CLS contact and those on 
probation. Psychological distress was significant for adults with no 
lifetime CLS contact and for adults with a lifetime arrest. Suicidal 
ideation was significant for adults with no CLS contact, those with a 
past-year arrest, and those on probation. Multimorbidity was significant 
for no CLS contact, lifetime arrest, and past-year arrest. Lastly, alcohol 
SUD was significant for lifetime arrest and parole, while drug SUD was 
significant for no CLS contact. 
4.5. CLS contact and doctor visits 
Findings for the logistic regression analyses with a doctor visit as the 
dependent variable are shown in Table 5. These findings clearly indicate 
that having insurance significantly increases the likelihood of a doctor 
visit for all groups. This includes both insured only versus uninsured/ 
unemployed and insured/employed versus uninsured/unemployed. 
Being employed only was associated with a decreased likelihood of a 
doctor visit for adults with no CLS contact. 
All health conditions, except suicidal ideation and marijuana SUD, 
were significantly associated with a doctor visit among adults with no 
CLS contact. For adults with a lifetime arrest, depression, psychological 
distress, and multimorbidity increased the likelihood of a doctor visit. 
For adults with past-year CLS contact only depression (parole), psy­
chological distress (probation), and multimorbidity (parole) were 
significantly associated with increased doctor visits. 
5. Discussion 
The current study assessed how different types of CLS contact were 
associated with healthcare utilization among a national sample of U.S. 
adults. By separating CLS contact by type, we hoped to expand on a 
growing body of literature that assesses the association between CLS 
contact, health conditions, and healthcare utilization. Consistent with 
prior literature we found that adults with CLS contact were more likely 
to report emergency room and hospital visits, but less likely to report 
regular doctor visits than adults with no CLS contact (Baggio et al., 2019; 
Frank et al., 2014; Hawks et al., 2022; Jue et al., 2023). 
A major contribution of the current research was our analysis 
comparing healthcare utilization across different types of CLS contact. 
Prior research has highlighted significant differences in health outcomes 
type of CLS contact, with adults with an arrest being more likely to 
report a suicide attempt (Bryson et al., 2021) and polysubstance use 
(Ford et al., 2022) than those on probation or parole. While another 
study highlighted the negative impact of probation on health among 
Black adults (Ni˜
no et al., 2023). Consistent with these findings the 
current research found significant differences between arrest and pro­
bation and arrest and parole. Adults with an arrest in the past-year were 
more likely to report an emergency room visit, an overnight hospital 
stay, and regular doctor visits than adults who were on probation or 
parole. This finding suggests that being placed on community supervi­
sion may act as a barrier to accessing healthcare among adults. Prior 
research indicates that conditions of community supervision and a lack 
in continuity of care for the formerly incarcerated are important barriers 
to healthcare utilization (Capece, 2022; Fahmy & Wallace, 2018). This 
finding highlights the importance of establishing strong community- 
level resources and support services that can facilitate social reintegra­
tion after CLS contact. 
A second major contribution of the current research was to

determine how being insured and/or employed impacted access to 
healthcare utilization across different types of CLS contact. Results from 
the current study show that adults with past-year CLS contact have 
higher prevalence rates of being uninsured and unemployed. This is 
important as prior research indicates that having health insurance in­
creases all types of healthcare utilization but has the largest impact on 
primary care visits (Olfson et al., 2022; Sommers et al., 2017). 
Conversely, among the uninsured there is increased utilization of acute 
care (ER, hospital) compared to primary care (regular doctor) services 
(Hawks et al., 2020; Winkelman et al., 2016). Additionally, there is a 
growing connection between substance use and mental health condi­
tions and emergency room visits among the uninsured and those with 
CLS contact (Frank et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2023). 
Importantly, having health insurance while being unemployed was 
consistently associated with increased healthcare utilization. For adults 
with an arrest, being insured/unemployed increased hospital stays and 
doctor visits. For adults on probation, being insured/unemployed 
increased ER visits and doctor visits. For adults on probation, being 
insured/unemployed increased doctor visits. Additionally, adults with 
past-year CLS contact reported similar rates of being insured/unem­
ployed compared to adults with no past-year CLS contact. The similarity 
in rates of being insured, while unemployed, may be attributable to 
increased access to health insurance since the implementation of the 
Affordable Care Act (Gutierrez & Pettit, 2020; Winkelman et al., 2016). 
To further support the importance of insurance, over employment, 
healthcare utilization was decreased among adults who were employed 
but uninsured in the current study. 
5.1. Limitations 
While the NSDUH is one of the most widely used epidemiological 
studies to assess health-related behaviors, a few limitations are worth 
noting. First, the NSDUH is cross-sectional, which makes it problematic 
to infer any causal relationships. Second, the data were collected via 
self-report. The NSDUH methodology takes several steps to address self- 
report bias, including collecting data via ACASI methods (Center for 
Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality, 2020). Third, the NSDUH does 
not include individuals who are incarcerated (Compton et al., 2010), 
there is no way to determine whether adults with a past-year arrest spent 
any time in jail, and there is no information of the specific conditions of 
community supervision, which can vary from state to state and even at 
the county level within states. 
6. Conclusion 
The current research adds to a growing literature on the adverse 
outcomes associated with criminal-legal system contact by assessing 
healthcare utilization across different types of CLS contact. The 
disruption in accessing healthcare among adults with CLS contact, 
particularly among adults on probation or parole, likely contributes to 
health disparities in this vulnerable population (Capece, 2022; Fahmy & 
Wallace, 2018; Ni˜
no et al., 2023). The finding that insurance increased 
access to healthcare among adults with past-year CLS contact bolsters 
the claim that maintaining continuity in care between the criminal 
justice system and public health services is important (Baggio et al., 
2019; Shavit et al., 2017). Lastly, given the strong crime-health link we 
concur with other scholars that a multidimensional framework is needed 
to reduce health disparities and criminal involvement, and limit the 
collateral consequences of CLS contact (Jackson & Vaughn, 2018).

Background: Practitioners expected the Affordable Care Act (ACA) to increase availability of health services and 
access to treatment for Americans with substance use disorders (SUDs). Yet research has not examined the 
associations among ACA enrollment mechanisms, deductibles, and the use of SUD treatment and other 
healthcare services. Understanding these relationships can inform future healthcare policy. 
Methods: We conducted a longitudinal analysis of patients with SUDs newly enrolled in the Kaiser Permanente 
Northern California health system in 2014 (N = 6957). Analyses examined the likelihood of service utilization 
(primary care, specialty SUD treatment, psychiatry, inpatient, and emergency department [ED]) over three years 
after SUD diagnosis, and associations with enrollment mechanisms (ACA Exchange vs. other), deductibles (none, 
$1–$999 [low] and ≥$1000 [high]), membership duration, psychiatric comorbidity, and demographic char­
acteristics. We also evaluated whether the enrollment mechanism moderated the associations between deduc­
tible limits and utilization likelihood. 
Results: Service utilization was highest in the 6 months after SUD diagnosis, decreased in the following 
6 months, and remained stable in years 2–3. Relative to patients with no deductible, those with a high deductible 
had lower odds of using all health services except SUD treatment; associations with primary care and psychiatry 
were strongly negative among Exchange enrollees. Among non-Exchange enrollees, patients with deductibles 
were more likely than those without deductibles to receive SUD treatment. Exchange enrollment compared to 
other mechanisms was associated with less ED use. Psychiatric comorbidity was associated with greater use of all 
services. Nonwhite patients were less likely to initiate SUD and psychiatry treatment. 
Conclusions: Higher deductibles generally were associated with use of fewer health services, especially in 
combination with enrollment through the Exchange. The role of insurance factors, psychiatric comorbidity and 
race/ethnicity in health services for people with SUDs are important to consider as health policy evolves.   
1. Introduction 
Health care reform in the United States has had major implications 
for people with substance use disorders (SUDs) (Buck, 2011; Druss & 
Mauer, 2010; Molfenter et al., 2012), including greater opportunities to 
enroll in private insurance coverage, increased access to services, and 
changes in health care costs (Feder et al., 2017; Saloner et al., 2017). 
The Affordable Care Act (ACA) (U.S. Congress, 2010) established state 
insurance exchanges to promote and offer health coverage, and man­
dated SUD and psychiatric disorder treatment as essential benefits. 
Practitioners expected these ACA mandates, implemented in 2014, to 
increase access to care (Humphreys & Frank, 2014; Tai & Volkow, 
2013). 
Following ACA implementation in 2014, the overall number of in­
dividuals living without insurance dropped (Maclean & Saloner, 2019;  
Thomas et al., 2018). Evidence suggests a positive impact of the ACA on 
both SUD and psychiatry coverage (Cowell et al., 2018; Novak et al., 
2018; Shover et al., 2019), including an increase in insurance choices 
(Abraham et al., 2017; Andrews et al., 2018; Feder et al., 2017). The 
number of individuals with identified SUDs enrolled in health plans

increased (Campbell et al., 2018). But access to services remains a 
major concern (Feder et al., 2017; Saloner et al., 2017), and much is 
still unknown regarding how ACA-associated enrollment through in­
surance exchanges and cost-sharing structures (especially deductibles) 
are associated with access to and use of SUD treatment and other health 
services in this complex patient population. 
SUD treatment initiation and retention are key clinical goals for 
SUD patients (Mertens & Weisner, 2000; Satre et al., 2010; Satre et al., 
2004). Specific characteristics of the ACA, such as enrollment via new 
state insurance exchanges and increased patient cost sharing via higher 
deductibles, may influence treatment differentially for people with 
SUDs who may be new enrollees (with or without prior coverage). 
Patient cost sharing (e.g., high deductibles) may adversely impact both 
initiation and retention. If SUD treatment and psychiatry services are 
viewed as discretionary and less essential than primary care, they may 
be especially vulnerable to cost-sharing mechanisms (Lo Sasso & Lyons, 
2002, 2004; Stein et al., 2000). A previous evaluation of SUD patients 
enrolled in the same California healthcare system found that compared 
to a pre-ACA enrollment cohort with SUDs, post-ACA SUD patients had 
more psychiatric and medical conditions and greater enrollment in 
high-deductible plans. Although this prior work did not examine pat­
terns of health service utilization, the findings suggest that newly en­
rolled patients post-ACA may have greater clinical needs as well as 
increased financial obstacles to accessing services (Campbell et al., 
2018). It is important to not only evaluate SUD treatment initiation and 
retention over time following implementation of the ACA, but also to 
evaluate how factors related to the ACA may influence utilization of 
other health services. 
The current study aimed to extend what is currently known about 
the consequences of healthcare reform by examining the potential re­
lationship of ACA exchange enrollment and high deductible health 
plans to trends in health service utilization in a cohort of individuals 
who were newly enrolled in a healthcare system and had a documented 
SUD. We examined factors associated with utilization as conceptualized 
by the Andersen model of healthcare utilization (Andersen, 1995;  
Weisner et al., 2002), which proposes that utilization is determined by 
predisposing (e.g., race/ethnicity and other demographic factors) need 
(e.g., diagnoses) (Andersen, 1995) and enabling factors (e.g., benefit 
plan, Exchange enrollment) (Dhingra et al., 2010). We hypothesized 
that psychiatric comorbidity would be associated with greater use of 
health services, and that members with higher deductibles would be 
less likely to initiate SUD and psychiatry treatment but would have 
higher emergency department (ED) and inpatient utilization than those 
without deductibles. As with earlier studies (Holder, 1998;  
Parthasarathy et al., 2001), which indicate that SUD diagnosis is often 
precipitated by a critical event such as an ED visit, we expected that 
postdiagnosis utilization would be highest in the period immediately 
following diagnosis but would likely decrease over time, although tra­
jectories would vary by type of utilization. Knowing how these factors 
are associated with use of healthcare can be highly informative to fu­
ture healthcare reform and behavioral health services research. 
2. Methods 
2.1. Study setting 
Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) is an integrated 
healthcare system serving approximately 4 million members (45% of 
the commercially insured population in the region) (Terhune, 2013). 
The membership is racially and socioeconomically diverse and re­
presentative of the demographic of the geographic area (Gordon, 2015;  
Selby et al., 2005). SUD treatment is provided in specialty clinics within 
KPNC, which patients can access directly without a referral. The group- 
based treatment model (with individual counseling and medications as 
needed) is similar to outpatient treatment programs nationwide. 
Treatment sessions take place daily or four times a week, depending on 
severity, for nine weeks (Satre et al., 2004). Treatment in psychiatry 
includes assessment, individual and group psychotherapy, and medi­
cation management (Lake & Turner, 2017). KPNC is not contracted to 
provide SUD care or intensive psychiatry treatment for Medicaid pa­
tients and those patients are referred to county providers. The Uni­
versity of California, San Francisco and Kaiser Permanente Northern 
California Institutional Review Boards approved the study and ap­
proved a waiver of informed consent. 
2.2. Data source and cohort 
We extracted all data from electronic health records (EHRs). The 
study cohort included adults aged 18–64 years who were newly en­
rolled in KPNC between 1/1/2014 and 12/31/2014, had an SUD di­
agnosis documented in the EHR within one year of enrollment, and 
were still enrolled in the six months following their SUD diagnosis 
(n = 6957). We focused on new enrollees based on the premise that 
ACA-related influence would be more apparent among first-time en­
rollees than in the overall SUD-diagnosed membership. We included 
individuals with Medicaid (17%) but excluded individuals aged 65 and 
older because the ACA has less directly impacted Medicare enrollees. 
We used International Classification of Diseases, Version 9, (ICD-9) codes 
of 291, 292, 303–305 (excluding 305.1 of tobacco dependence) and 
ICD-10 codes of F10–F19 to identify SUDs; we excluded those with 
tobacco use disorder only. 
2.3. Measures 
We extracted patient demographic, clinical, and service utilization 
data for the 36 months following the first SUD diagnosis date (the index 
date), giving each individual up to 36 months of follow-up except in the 
case of death or disenrollment. We aggregated longitudinal data into 6- 
month intervals, yielding a maximum of 6 repeated measures for every 
individual. 
2.3.1. Demographics 
We linked sex, age at index date, and race/ethnicity using unique 
identifiers. 
2.3.2. Type of SUD 
We identified the type of SUD (e.g., alcohol, cannabis, ampheta­
mines, cocaine, opioids, hallucinogens, and sedatives), and comorbid 
tobacco use disorder. 
2.3.3. Membership duration before SUD diagnosis 
We calculated the duration of time between enrollment at KPNC and 
patients' index date (e.g. first SUD diagnosis), and categorized patients 
based on whether they were members for < 6 months or ≥6 months 
before their index date. 
2.3.4. Chronic medical comorbidities 
We identified common chronic medical conditions (Ornstein et al., 
2013), many of which are known to be associated with SUDs (Mertens 
et al., 2003) using ICD-9/10 codes recorded within the first year after 
initial enrollment. Conditions included asthma, atherosclerosis, atrial 
fibrillation, chronic kidney disease, chronic liver disease, chronic ob­
structive pulmonary disease, coronary disease, diabetes mellitus, de­
mentia, epilepsy, gastroesophageal reflux, heart failure, hyperlipi­
demia, hypertension, migraine, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis and 
osteopenia, Parkinson's disease or syndrome, peptic ulcer, and rheu­
matoid arthritis. Patients with chronic medical conditions utilize more 
health services than patients without such conditions (Gulley et al., 
2011), which may influence their decision to choose a plan with a lower 
(or no) deductible if given an option (Gulley et al., 2011), so we in­
cluded this covariate to control for confounding.

2.3.5. Psychiatric disorder comorbidities 
Using ICD-9/10 codes recorded within the first year of initial en­
rollment at KPNC, we identified psychiatric disorders regulated by 
California mental health parity law (i.e., bipolar disorder, depressive 
disorders, developmental disorders, eating disorders, obsessive com­
pulsive and panic disorders, and schizophrenia) (Disability Rights 
California, 2014), plus anxiety disorders. 
2.3.6. Individual deductible limits and ACA exchange mechanisms 
Deductibles are features across different benefit plans, including 
commercial plans, but are more common in ACA benefit plans. The 
individual deductible limit is the amount the individual must pay out- 
of-pocket for health expenses before eligibility for health plan benefits. 
At KPNC, there are many types of benefit plans that include deductibles. 
Patients with deductible plans that do not include SUD as a covered 
benefit are responsible for bearing the cost of those services until their 
deductible is reached, and/or the accumulating cost of copays for 
multiple visits as part of the SUD care model. We did not include type of 
insurance (beyond deductible limits) as a covariate due to its colli­
nearity with deductible limits and enrollment via the ACA exchange 
(Medicaid patients did not have a deductible and enrolled through 
another mechanism). 
We categorized deductible limits into three levels (none, 1–$999 
and ≥$1000), as in prior research (Parthasarathy & Campbell, 2016) 
and based on the definition of high deductibles (Galbraith et al., 2011) 
and benefit plans available at KPNC during this period. Since deductible 
limits may change over time, we used the minimum level over each 6- 
month time window during follow-up. We imputed missing deductible 
levels during a given 6-month window (n = 231) with the last known 
value during the follow-up period, and we dropped patients with no 
known deductible limit during the entire 36 months of follow-up from 
the analysis (n = 25). 
Coverage mechanism included enrollment via the California 
Exchange vs. other mechanisms (e.g., employer-based large group 
purchasers or individual plans not purchased on the Exchange). 
2.3.7. Service utilization 
We examined utilization of primary care, specialty SUD treatment 
and psychiatry, and inpatient hospitalization and ED use and created a 
dichotomous measure for whether individuals had any visits or no visits 
in these settings in each 6-month time interval. We aggregated utili­
zation in each 6-month time interval as total counts and dichotomous 
measures (any utilization vs. none).

2.4. Analyses 
We summarized utilization data into 6-month intervals, and we 
examined trends in health service utilization over 36 months after pa­
tients received an SUD diagnosis with Chi-squared tests using 6-month 
intervals. Using multivariable logistic regression, we examined asso­
ciations between deductible limits, enrollment via the California ACA 
Exchange, membership duration, and psychiatric comorbidity; and the 
likelihood of utilizing health services (dichotomous—any use versus 
none) in the 36-month follow-up period, controlling for patient demo­
graphic characteristics (i.e., gender, age, and race/ethnicity) and 
chronic medical comorbidity. We also evaluated whether enrollment 
via the California ACA exchange moderated the associations between 
deductible limits and the likelihood of utilization by adding interaction 
terms to the multivariable models. We estimated the associations with 
deductible limits for each enrollment mechanism by constructing hy­
pothesis tests and confidence intervals on linear combinations of the 
regression coefficients from these models. To account for correlation 
between repeated measures, we used the generalized estimating equa­
tions methodology (Liang & Zeger, 1986). We censored patients at a 
given 6-month interval if they were not a member of KPNC during that 
time. 
We conducted a sensitivity analysis to determine whether high 
utilizers leaving the health system influenced the observed pattern of 
decreased utilization from the 0–6 month to the 6–12 month follow-up 
periods. Using Chi-squared tests, we compared utilization during the 
0–6 month period between patients who remained in the cohort (non­
censored group) and patients who disenrolled from KPNC (censored 
group) at 6–12 months. We hypothesized that if the censored group had 
greater utilization than the noncensored group, then there would be 
evidence of high utilizers leaving the health system. We also conducted 
Chi-squared tests to determine whether censorship was associated with 
deductible limits and enrollment mechanisms. 
We conducted all analyses using SAS v9.4. We assessed significance 
at a p-value < .05. 
3. Results 
3.1. Cohort characteristics and bivariate associations 
The final study cohort consisted of 6957 patients, who were 62% 
male and 58% white (Table 1), with a mean age of 39 years (SD = 12; 
data not shown). About 17% enrolled via the California ACA Exchange, 
among whom a larger proportion enrolled in plans with high (≥$1000) 
and low ($1–$999) deductibles (28% and 37%, respectively), compared 
to patients who enrolled via other mechanisms (17% and 7%, respec­
tively). The average duration of KPNC membership before receiving an 
SUD diagnosis was 146 days (SD = 106), with 64% of the cohort 
having < 6 months of membership. Alcohol (58%) and cannabis use 
disorder (30%) were the most commonly diagnosed SUDs. More than 
half of the cohort had a psychiatric disorder (58%); anxiety (37%) and 
depressive disorders (36%) were the most prevalent. Approximately 
61% of the cohort had a chronic medical comorbidity. Patient char­
acteristics by deductible limit (Table S1) and type of SUD diagnosis 
(Table S2) are presented in the Supplementary Material. 
3.2. Unadjusted trends in likelihood of utilization 
Utilization of any primary care, specialty SUD treatment, psy­
chiatry, inpatient hospitalizations, and ED was highest in the 
0–6 months after index and decreased in the subsequent (6–12 months) 
time window; utilization remained stable thereafter (Fig. 1, Table S3). 
These trends did not vary by deductible limit (Fig. S1) or type of SUD 
diagnosis (Fig. S2). 
3.3. Adjusted relative likelihood of utilizing health services 
Controlling for demographic characteristics, chronic medical con­
ditions, and psychiatric comorbidities, there was evidence that the 
enrollment mechanism moderated the associations between deductible 
limits and the likelihood of utilizing primary care and psychiatry 
treatment from the multivariable models (Table 2; Fig. 2). Among pa­
tients who enrolled via the ACA exchange, those with high deductibles 
were less likely than those without deductibles to utilize primary care 
(odds ratio [OR] = 0.64, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.54–0.77) 
and psychiatry treatment (OR = 0.58, 95% CI = 0.45–0.74). The 
corresponding ORs among patients who enrolled via other non-ACA 
mechanisms were 0.83 (95% CI = 0.74–0.92) for primary care and 0.85 
(95% CI = 0.73–0.98) for psychiatry; these represent a significantly 
lower difference of 22% (ratio of odds ratios [ORR] = 0.78, 95% 
CI = 0.63–0.96) and 32% (ORR = 0.68, 95% CI = 0.51–0.91), re­
spectively. 
There was also evidence that the enrollment mechanism moderated 
the associations between deductibles and the likelihood of utilizing 
specialty SUD treatment after adjusting for all other patient char­
acteristics in the multivariable models. Among patients who enrolled 
via the ACA exchange, there were no significant differences in the 
likelihood of utilizing specialty SUD treatment between patients with 
deductibles and those without; however, among patients who enrolled 
via other mechanisms, patients with high (OR = 1.22, 95% 
CI = 1.04–1.42) or low deductibles (OR = 1.50, 95% CI = 1.22–1.85) 
were more likely than those without deductibles to utilize specialty 
SUD treatment. 
Compared to patients without a deductible, patients with high 
(OR = 0.80, 95% CI = 0.69–0.94) and low (OR = 0.79, 95% 
CI = 0.64–0.99) deductibles had lower odds of having a hospitalization 
(Table 3; Fig. 2). Similarly, high and low deductibles were associated 
with lower odds of ED utilization. Patients enrolled via the ACA Ex­
change had significantly lower odds of visiting the ED (OR = 0.67, 95% 
CI = 0.59–0.77), but had similar odds of using inpatient services as 
patients who enrolled through other mechanisms (OR = 0.88, 95% 
CI = 0.73–1.06). The enrollment mechanism did not moderate the 
associations between deductible limits and the likelihood of having an 
inpatient hospitalization or ED visit, controlling for demographics and 
comorbidities. 
Patients with a longer membership duration before receiving an 
SUD diagnosis (≥6 months) were less likely to utilize primary care 
(OR = 0.89, 95% CI = 0.83–0.96) and specialty SUD treatment 
(OR = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.69–0.87) than those with a shorter duration 
(< 6 months); there were no differences for psychiatry treatment, in­
patient hospitalizations, or ED visits (Tables 2–3). 
Patients with a comorbid psychiatric disorder had significantly

higher odds of using all health services studied, controlling for all other 
characteristics. Specifically, they had 1.4 to 2.1 times the odds of using 
primary care, specialty SUD, inpatient, and ED services; and 14 times 
the odds of using psychiatry treatment (Tables 2–3). Patients with a 
chronic medical comorbidity had significantly higher odds of utilizing 
all health services, except for specialty SUD treatment, which they were 
less likely to utilize (Tables 2–3). 
Controlling for all other characteristics, nonwhite patients had 
lower odds of initiating specialty SUD and psychiatry treatment 
(Table 2). Asian, Native Hawaiian, or Pacific Islander patients had 
higher odds of utilizing inpatient and ED services compared to white 
patients (Table 3). Hispanic patients were also more likely to utilize ED 
services, but Black patients were less likely, compared to white patients. 
Compared to younger patients (18–34 years), older patients 
(50–64 years) had higher odds of utilizing primary care and inpatient 
services, but lower odds of utilizing psychiatry and ED services (Tables 
2–3). Patients aged 35–49 years had higher odds of utilizing primary 
care and specialty SUD services, but lower odds of utilizing inpatient 
and ED services, compared to patients aged 18–34 years (Tables 2–3). 
3.4. Sensitivity analysis 
Since the most noticeable change in utilization occurred in the 
6–12 month period, we conducted sensitivity analyses comparing pa­
tients who remained in the cohort at 6–12 months (noncensored, 
n = 5976), to patients who were censored due to disenrollment during 
that time (n = 981). The censored group used less primary care (59% 
vs. 77%, p  <  .001) and psychiatry services (20% vs. 29%, p  <  .001) 
in the first 6 months but were slightly more likely to visit the ED (64% 
vs. 60%, p = .009; Table S6). There was no difference between the 
censored and the noncensored group in specialty SUD and inpatient 
utilization. The censored group had a larger proportion of patients with

high deductibles (28% vs. 19%, p  <  .001) and a smaller proportion of 
patients who enrolled via the ACA exchange (13% vs 18%, p  <  .001) 
compared to the noncensored group (Table S6). 
4. Discussion 
This study examined longitudinal patterns of healthcare utilization 
among SUD patients and their relationships to key aspects of ACA 
benefit plans, including enrollment mechanisms and deductible levels. 
We anticipated that the increase in coverage opportunities that the ACA 
provided would bring high-utilizing patients into health systems, 
driving up overall use of healthcare. Consistent with prior studies of 
SUD treatment samples that have found elevated levels of healthcare 
utilization either immediately before or after starting SUD treatment 
(Holder, 1998; Parthasarathy et al., 2001; Wickizer et al., 2006), results 
of our longitudinal analysis showed that utilization among people with 
SUDs was highest immediately after initial SUD diagnosis at KPNC, and 
declined to a stable level in subsequent years. This suggests that the 
initial high utilization may be temporary. Our sensitivity analysis sug­
gested that this result was not due to high utilizers leaving the KPNC 
healthcare system. This overall trend in utilization is a welcome 
finding, and consistent with the intent of the ACA to increase access to 
care; however, the subsequent decrease in utilization could also signify 
that patients are disengaging from treatment. 
Although we cannot specifically attribute the initial levels of utili­
zation to lack of prior insurance coverage, as we did not have data on 
prior coverage, we found that individuals with fewer than 6 months of 
membership before receiving an SUD diagnosis were more likely to 
utilize primary care and specialty SUD treatment than those who had 
6–12 months of membership. This suggests that future healthcare re­
forms that expand insurance coverage for people with SUDs might also 
lead to short-term increases in utilization for a range of health services. 
Deductibles are a key area of health policy interest given the 
growing number of people enrolling in deductible plans post-ACA. As 
anticipated, higher deductibles had a generally negative association 
with utilizing healthcare in this population. We found that patients with 
high deductibles (≥$1000) had lower odds of using primary care, 
psychiatry, inpatient, and ED services than those without deductibles. 
Additionally, we found the associations between high deductibles and 
likelihood of utilizing primary care and psychiatry were strongly ne­
gative among ACA Exchange enrollees. Although it is somewhat diffi­
cult to gauge the clinical significance of these specific results, the 
strength of the odds ratios for primary care and psychiatry access gives 
some indication of the potential impact. The associations of high de­
ductibles with primary care and psychiatry access is worrying given the 
extent of medical and psychiatric comorbidities among people with 
SUDs (Mertens et al., 2008). Although we found more consistent asso­
ciations for higher deductibles and less healthcare initiation, it is pos­
sible that even a modest deductible could deter patients from seeking 
treatment (Brot-Goldberg et al., 2017; Reed et al., 2009). From a public 
policy and health system perspective, the possibility that deductibles 
could prevent people with SUDs from accessing any needed medical 
care is a cause for concern. 
Consistent with prior findings (Agarwal et al., 2017), our results 
suggest that high deductibles have the potential to dissuade SUD pa­
tients from accessing needed health services, and that those who enroll 
via the ACA exchange may be more sensitive to them. This could be 
attributable to greater awareness of coverage terms due to the mandate 
that exchange websites offer clear, plain-language explanations to 
compare insurance options (HealthCare.gov, 2020). In contrast, high 
deductibles were associated with a greater relative likelihood of SUD 
treatment utilization. However, this association existed only among 
patients who enrolled via mechanisms other than the ACA Exchange. It 
is possible that individuals with emerging or unrecognized substance 
use problems may have selected higher deductible plans at enrollment 
due to either not anticipating use of SUD treatment, which is often more

price-sensitive relative to other medical care (Hodgkin et al., 2003;  
Parthasarathy & Campbell, 2016; Swartz, 2010), or not being aware of 
the implications of deductibles. However, once engaged in treatment, 
individuals with high deductibles may have been motivated to remain 
there. A contributing factor could also be that such patients were re­
quired to remain in treatment either by employer or court mandates, 
which are common and are associated with retention (Weisner et al., 
2009). The varying associations between deductibles and different 
types of health service utilization by enrollment mechanisms highlight 
the need for future research in this area. 
Insurance exchanges provide access to tax credits, a broader range 
of coverage levels, and information to assist in healthcare planning that 
might be less easily accessible through other sources of coverage, e.g., 
through employers (HealthCare.gov, 2019). In our sample, Exchange 
enrollment was associated with greater likelihood of remaining a 
member of KPNC, did not demonstrate an adverse association with 
routine care, and was associated with lower ED use. However, primary 
care and psychiatric services use were similar across enrollment types, 
even within low and high deductible limits. Prior studies have found 
that health plans offered through the ACA Exchange are more likely to 
have narrow behavioral health networks compared to other non-Ex­
change plans (Stewart et al., 2018) and primary care networks (Zhu 
et al., 2017), which raises concerns about treatment access. For this 
health system, that concern appears unfounded. 
Psychiatric comorbidity was associated with greater service use of 
all types. Several prior studies have also found that patients with psy­
chiatric comorbidity use more health services than those with SUD 
alone (Curran et al., 2008; Graham et al., 2017; Painter et al., 2018). 
Similar to our results, a recent study based in California found that after 
controlling for patient-level characteristics, the strongest predictors of 
frequent ED use post-ACA included having a diagnosis of a psychiatric 
disorder or an SUD (McConville et al., 2018). While the ACA was not 
expected to alter this general pattern, the inclusion of mental health 
treatment as an essential benefit was intended to improve availability of 
care and to contribute to efforts to reduce unnecessary service utiliza­
tion. Our investigation confirms the ongoing importance post-ACA of 
psychiatric comorbidity and suggests that future efforts in behavioral 
health reform must anticipate high demand for healthcare in this vul­
nerable clinical population. 
It is also worth noting that nonwhite patients were less likely to 
initiate SUD and psychiatry treatment. Race/ethnic disparities in access 
to care are a longstanding concern in the addiction field (U.S. 
Department of Health and Human Services & Office of the Surgeon 
General, 2016). Some expected these disparities to be mitigated post- 
ACA (Guerrero et al., 2017). Findings on race/ethnic differences are 
similar to what has been observed in other health systems (McGuire & 
Miranda, 2008; Saloner & Le Cook, 2013); although, few studies have 
examined associations post-ACA. One prior study among young adults 
with SUD and psychiatric conditions post-ACA found modest ethnic 
disparities in lack of coverage (5–19% differences in coverage) between 
whites and other ethnic groups (Novak et al., 2017); although, another 
study of young people more broadly found larger gains in coverage 
among Hispanics and Blacks relative to whites (Lipton et al., 2019). The 
race/ethnic disparities in SUD and psychiatry treatment initiation in 
this cohort, in which overall insurance coverage was not a barrier but 
specific mechanisms could be, highlight the importance of addressing 
this complicated challenge to health equity. 
4.1. Study strengths and limitations 
This study used a large SUD patient cohort enrolled in health cov­
erage post-ACA and included comprehensive data on diagnoses, in­
surance coverage, and use of care over three years. KPNC data are well- 
suited to examine ACA-related changes in health service utilization 
given the size and diversity of its membership. KPNC's integrated model 
is becoming more common as other health plans and federally qualified 
health centers move toward providing integrated SUD treatment ser­
vices and using EHRs (Pourat et al., 2012). However, we should note 
that is an observational study based on EHR data. As such, we cannot 
attribute causal relationships to our findings. However, we have con­
ducted sensitivity analyses to examine the robustness of our findings in 
the absence of a randomized clinical trial. These analyses supported our 
initial findings; e.g., indicating that service use decrease over time was 
not due to high utilizers leaving KPNC. Medicaid expansion has the 
potential to improve access to SUD treatment (Andrews et al., 2019), 
but we were also not able to examine its relationship to services in the 
current analysis due to collinearity with deductible limits (Medicaid 
patients in our cohort did not have a deductible). Our study was set in a 
single nonprofit healthcare delivery system in Northern California, 
which enabled us to characterize post-ACA patterns of service utiliza­
tion in depth but did not allow us to compare populations or im­
plementation across systems (e.g., public vs. private). Nevertheless, our 
findings can inform future work on health reform and policy efforts to 
improve access to healthcare for similar clinically complex patients in 
other health systems. 
4.2. Conclusion 
The ACA provided a critical opportunity to expand access to SUD 
treatment as well as other important health services for people with 
SUDs, yet research as rarely examined implementation and subsequent 
use of care. This study found that in newly enrolled patients with SUDs, 
health service utilization peaked in the 6 months following an SUD 
diagnosis and then decreased to a stable level in years 2–3. Among 
patients with SUDs, deductible limits were generally associated with 
less health service utilization, which was more pronounced among 
Exchange enrollees, while psychiatric comorbidity was associated with 
more use of services. As modifications to the ACA are considered, it is 
critical to continue investigating the consequences of health reform 
policies for people with SUDs, including race/ethnic minorities and 
those with psychiatric comorbidity.

Impact of a Primary Care CKD Registry in a US Public
Safety-Net Health Care Delivery System: A Pragmatic
Randomized Trial
Delphine S. Tuot, Charles E. McCulloch, Alexandra Velasquez, Dean Schillinger, Chi-yuan Hsu,
Margaret Handley, and Neil R. Powe
Background: Many individuals with chronic kid-
ney disease (CKD) do not receive guideline-
concordant care. We examined the impact of a
team-based
primary
care
CKD
registry
on
clinical measures and processes of care among
patients with CKD cared for in a public safety-
net health care delivery system.
Study Design: Pragmatic trial of a CKD registry
versus a usual-care registry for 1 year.
Setting & Participants: Primary care providers
(PCPs) and their patients with CKD in a safety-
net primary care setting in San Francisco.
Intervention: The CKD registry identiﬁed at point
of care all patients with CKD, those with blood
pressure (BP) > 140/90 mm Hg, those without
angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor/
angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) prescription,
and those without albuminuria quantiﬁcation in
the past year. It also provided quarterly feedback
pertinent to these metrics to promote “outreach”
to patients with CKD. The usual-care registry
provided point-of-care cancer screening and
immunization data.
Outcomes: Changes in systolic BP at 12 months
(primary outcome), proportion of patients with BP
control, prescription of ACE inhibitors/ARBs,
quantiﬁcation of albuminuria, severity of albumin-
uria, and estimated glomerular ﬁltration rate.
Results: The patient population (n = 746) had a
mean age of 56.7 ± 12.1 (standard deviation) years,
was 53% women, and was diverse (8% non-
Hispanic white, 35.7% black, 24.5% Hispanic, and
24.4% Asian). Randomization to the CKD registry
(30 PCPs, 285 patients) versus the usual-care
registry (49 PCPs, 461 patients) was associated
with 2-fold greater odds of ACE inhibitor/ARB
prescription (adjusted OR, 2.25; 95% CI, 1.45-
3.49) and albuminuria quantiﬁcation (adjusted OR,
2.44; 95% CI, 1.38-4.29) during the 1-year study
period. Randomization to the CKD registry was not
associated with changes in systolic BP, proportion
of patients with uncontrolled BP, or degree of
albuminuria or estimated glomerular ﬁltration rate.
Limitations: Potential misclassiﬁcation of CKD;
missing baseline medication data; limited to study
of a public safety-net health care system.
Conclusions: A team-based safety-net primary
care CKD registry did not improve BP parameters,
but led to greater albuminuria quantiﬁcation and
more ACE inhibitor/ARB prescriptions after 1 year.
Adoption of team-based CKD registries may
represent an important step in translating evidence
into practice for CKD management.
M
ore than 20 million Americans have chronic kidney
disease (CKD).1 Compared with individuals with
normal kidney function, those with CKD have greater odds
of experiencing a premature cardiovascular event or death,
independent of age, sex, and comorbid conditions.2 Lower
income and racial/ethnic minority patients are more likely
to have kidney failure, placing a unique burden on health
care systems that disproportionately provide for their care.3
Although randomized controlled trials have shown that
controlling blood pressure (BP) and reducing proteinuria
with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or
angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) can delay CKD decline
and progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and
decrease CKD-associated morbidity and mortality,4-7 many
individuals with CKD are not receiving these evidence-based
treatments.8 The failure to implement these best practices
may be related to providers’ poor CKD awareness9,10 and
limited conﬁdence among primary care providers (PCPs) in
delivering CKD care11 in the context of inefﬁcient health
care systems that rely on overburdened providers to deliver
chronic disease care to complex patients.
Disease registries are information platforms that can
enhance chronic disease management.12 Often embedded
within electronic health records, disease registries capture
and track patient-level data, allowing health care teams to
proactively manage patients through “in-reach” at point of
care or using “outreach” through patient contact outside
of scheduled appointment times. Registries have been
documented to improve the quality of chronic disease
care,13
including
for
patients
with
diabetes14
and
congestive heart failure.15 Prior studies of CKD registries in
the United States with computer-assisted prompts/alerts
have not improved process outcomes related to CKD
management or clinical outcomes,16,17 though they have
been successful in the United Kingdom.18
We hypothesized that the prior negative results in the
United States were not likely due to unique refractoriness
of CKD to the registry approach, but more likely because
prior US CKD registries have focused on behavior change

Original Investigation
among individual physicians rather than on entire health
care teams and systems of care. With input from primary
care leaders and quality improvement champions in a
safety-net health system, we created an electronic CKD
registry that identiﬁes patients with CKD and provides data
about CKD management to the entire health care team.19
We then tested this approach to improve kidney health
in a pragmatic trial in safety-net primary care clinics with a
high burden of hypertension and CKD.
Methods
Study Population, Setting, and Study Design
This pragmatic trial (ClinicalTrials.gov study number
NCT03473509) took place in 2 primary care clinics in San
Francisco’s public health care delivery system in 2013 to
2015. These clinics were selected because of the high
prevalence of CKD among their patient populations and
because one was an academic training clinic and the other
was a community clinic without trainees. No other clinics
were approached for participation. All PCPs who worked
in practice teams and provided longitudinal primary care
to patients were eligible to participate in this study. PCPs
who solely provided specialty care, for example, human
immunodeﬁciency virus (HIV) services or urgent care,
were excluded. Practice teams that consisted of several
physicians (with or without trainees), one nurse, nurse
practitioners, medical assistants, and behaviorists were
randomly assigned 1:1 to one of 2 arms with a random
number generator: access to an electronic CKD registry or a
usual-care registry for 12 months. This randomization
scheme minimized contamination by medical assistants,
who work with several providers within a given practice
team, but led to differences in the number of PCPs
randomly assigned to each arm due to different practice
team sizes.
Approval to conduct this study was granted by the
Human Research Protection Program and Institutional
Review
Board
at
the
University
of
California,
San
Francisco, with waived patient consent. Medical directors
of the 2 participating clinics provided verbal consent to
participate in this study; health care providers in the clinics
implied consent if they used the CKD registry. Health care
teams randomly assigned to intervention had the option to
not use the information provided by the CKD registry to
manage
their
patients.
The
trial
was
not
blinded
to participating teams and providers, though the analytic
team was blinded to group assignment.
Intervention
The CKD registry was designed to alert practice teams of a
patient’s CKD-relevant information and enhance guideline-
concordant care delivery for patients with CKD. The CKD
registry deﬁned patients as having CKD if they had 2 values
for dipstick albuminuria > 1+ or albuminuria with albu-
min excretion > 30 mg/g or 2 values of race-concordant
estimated glomerular ﬁltration rate (eGFR) of 15 to
59 mL/min/1.37 m2 calculated using the Modiﬁcation of
Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) Study equation (standard of
care in the health system), separated by at least 3 months.
It excluded individuals with eGFRs < 15 mL/min/1.37 m2
and patients with ESRD. The CKD registry provided pri-
mary care practice teams with point-of-care data about
patient-speciﬁc CKD status (eGFR and CKD on problem
list), recent ambulatory clinic BP readings, status of ACE
inhibitor/ARB prescription, and quantiﬁcation of albu-
minuria (complete vs not complete). The CKD registry also
provided data about diabetes care, immunization status,
and data pertinent to age-appropriate cancer screening, to
align with usual care. Medical assistants were encouraged
to use these data to identify patients with CKD who needed
albuminuria quantiﬁcation and all patients (including
those with CKD) who were due for cancer screening or
immunizations. Point-of-care decision support embedded
within the CKD registry reminded PCPs about guideline-
concordant
care
for
individuals
with
non–dialysis-
requiring CKD: target BP < 140/90 mm Hg, prescription
of ACE inhibitors/ARBs, avoidance of nonsteroidal anti-
inﬂammatory medications, and prescription of statin
medications (Fig S1). Quarterly feedback to practice teams
and individual PCPs identiﬁed patients with CKD with
BPs > 140/90 mm Hg, those not prescribed an ACE in-
hibitor/ARB, and those with persistent severely increased
albuminuria for panel management to reach patients who
did not regularly visit their PCP and would thus not beneﬁt
from the in-reach component of the CKD registry. A
document
with
clinical
guidance
accompanied
each
quarterly report (Item S1). No additional resources were
provided to the teams randomly assigned to the inter-
vention arm of this study.
Usual care consisted of an electronic registry that was in
use before trial implementation. It provided practice teams
with
point-of-care
data
about
diabetes
care,
age-
appropriate cancer screening, and immunizations, but no
CKD-related data. Medical assistants were encouraged to
use the usual-care registry to identify patients who were
due for cancer screening or immunizations. Quarterly
feedback was not provided for practice teams randomly
assigned to receive usual care.
Outcomes
All outcome data were captured from the electronic health
record. The primary outcome was change in ambulatory
clinic systolic BP from baseline to 12 months. Medical
assistants use standard oscillometric devices to check BP in
all ambulatory clinics (including primary and specialty
care) with a standardized protocol. If the ﬁrst BP is
elevated, a second BP is obtained. Although both BP
measures are included in the medical record, only the
second BP at each ambulatory clinic visit was used in this
analysis. Secondary outcomes included changes in the
proportion
of
patients
with
BP
control
deﬁned
as
BP < 140/<90 mm Hg, proportion of patients whose
albuminuria was quantiﬁed among those who had not

received quantiﬁcation at trial initiation, albuminuria
severity, and proportion of patients prescribed an ACE
inhibitor/ARB or who had a documented reason for no
prescription (ie, allergy, prior development of hyper-
kalemia, or acute kidney injury). Change in eGFR was not
a prespeciﬁed outcome. However, it was included in a post
hoc analysis.
Covariates
PCP status (trainee, attending provider, and nurse practi-
tioner), average number of clinical sessions per week, and
years of experience were self-reported before trial initia-
tion regardless of whether they cared for patients with
CKD. Patient demographic data (age, sex, race/ethnicity,
language preference, and insurance status) and laboratory
data (serum creatinine and glycated hemoglobin) were
obtained from the electronic health record.
Study Power
Prior data from the health care network suggested a mean
systolic BP of 151 mm Hg for eligible patients, with
virtually no between-provider variance over 1 year
(intraclass coefﬁcient = 0.0008). We therefore used simple
t test calculations to conduct our power analyses. Using a
0.05 level of signiﬁcance and power of 0.8, we needed at
least 200 patients (100 per arm) to detect a 6-point dif-
ference in 12-month change in systolic BP between study
arms, assuming a standard deviation of systolic BP change
of 15 mm Hg. This magnitude of BP change has been
associated with substantial decreases in cardiovascular
health at the population level.20
Statistical Analyses
We used multilevel linear and logistic mixed models to
assess the impact of the CKD registry (vs usual-care reg-
istry) on change in systolic BP, change in proportion of
patients with BP control, change in albuminuria over time,
albuminuria quantiﬁcation at least once among patients
who were missing it at baseline, and use of ACE in-
hibitors/ARBs. In all these models, time was treated as a
categorical ﬁxed effect, with the primary test being the
interaction of time by intervention arm. Models were
adjusted for patient age, sex, race/ethnicity, baseline CKD
stage, clinic, and participation in the nested Kidney
Awareness Registry and Education (KARE) trial (n = 137)
that examined the synergistic and individual impact of
provider access to a CKD registry and patient participation
in a self-management support program on BP ascertained
at study visits.21 Models included random effects for pri-
mary care team and PCP and random slopes and intercepts
within patients. Random effects that were not statistically
signiﬁcant were dropped from the analysis.
For each outcome, the latest data from each 3-month
interval were used in the analysis. Between 78% and
80% of patients had data for every quarter they were
enrolled in the study. We could not ascertain medication
data from the newly implemented electronic medical
record at trial initiation; these data become available af-
terward. Thus, the outcome of ACE inhibitor/ARB use was
deﬁned as an active prescription > 50% of the time after
randomization. ACE inhibitor/ARB prescription data were
validated against PCP intent using the primary care prog-
ress note as the gold standard for a sample of patients from
the academic clinic. In a post hoc analysis, mixed models
were used to examine change in eGFR by trial arm by time;
w70% of patients had eGFR data for every quarter in
which they were enrolled.
To account for temporal trends, the effect of each
registry was estimated at baseline and at months 3, 6, 9,
and 12 (trial conclusion) using marginal effects estima-
tion22 in STATA (Statacorp). This analysis holds other
covariates (age, sex, race/ethnicity, baseline CKD stage,
clinic, and participation in nested KARE trial) ﬁxed at their
observed values while varying time and intervention. This
was accomplished using the ﬁtted model to calculate the
predicted outcome for each quarter and arm, as if the
patient were in each of the intervention arms at each time.
Interaction analyses were performed to examine the
impact of the CKD registry in 2 subgroups of patients
determined a priori: those with baseline moderate CKD
(CKD stages 3 and 4) and those with uncontrolled BP
(>140/>90 mm Hg) at baseline. A post hoc analysis was
performed to see whether the impact of the registry for
each outcome differed by PCP level of training (attending
provider, trainee physician, and nurse practitioner).
Results
Baseline Characteristics
The patient population (n = 746) had a mean age of
56.7 ± 12.1 (standard deviation) years, was 53% women,
and was racially/ethnically diverse (8% non-Hispanic
white, 35.7% black, 24.5% Hispanic, and 24.4% Asian).
Nearly 30% of patients with CKD had a non-English lan-
guage preference and all were publically insured or
uninsured. Of the patient population, 41.6% had CKD
stage 1 or 2, 38.6% had stage 3a, 15% had CKD stage 3b,
and 4.8% had CKD stage 4. Overall, 38% of the study
population had albuminuria quantiﬁed at baseline, with an
average albumin-creatinine ratio of 421 mg/g. Nearly
20% of patients had a glycated hemoglobin level > 6.5%
and 36% of patients had uncontrolled BP, with average
baseline
systolic
and
diastolic
BPs
of
133.6
and

respectively.
Characteristics
of
patients
whose providers were randomly assigned to the CKD
registry were similar to those whose providers were
randomly assigned to the usual-care registry, except with
regard to age, race/ethnicity, and language preference
(Table 1).
Among 96 PCPs who cared for patients with CKD at trial
initiation, 79 (82%) self-reported demographic data. Of
those providers, 91% practiced at the academic training
clinic. Nearly 27% of providers were attending physicians,
17% were nurse practitioners, and 56% were resident

trainees, without a difference in distribution by study arm
(P = 0.2). Many trainees practiced in one large team that
was randomly assigned to the usual-care registry. Providers
randomly assigned to the CKD registry arm appeared to
have more years of experience compared with those
randomly assigned to the usual-care registry, but this was
not statistically signiﬁcant (P = 0.1; Table 2).
Primary Outcome
There were 285 patients among 30 PCPs randomly assigned
to the CKD registry and 461 patients among 49 PCPs
randomly assigned to the usual-care registry. Random
assignment to the CKD registry versus the usual-care registry
was not associated with a change in systolic BP over time
(Ptime × registry = 0.9). Among patients randomly assigned
to the CKD registry, marginal estimates of systolic BP at
trial
initiation
and
conclusion
were
133.0
and
132.8 mm Hg, respectively. Among patients randomly
assigned to the usual-care registry, marginal estimates of
systolic BP at trial initiation and conclusion were 133.7
and 132.7 mm Hg, respectively (Fig 1). Interaction analyses

demonstrated that results did not differ by PCP level of
training (Ptime × registry × PCP training = 0.8), baseline CKD stage
(Ptime × registry × CKD stage = 0.8), or baseline controlled versus
uncontrolled BP (Ptime × registry × baseline BP = 0.7). Marginal
estimates of systolic BP for predetermined subgroups are
depicted in Fig 1.
Secondary Outcomes
Random assignment to the CKD registry was not associated
with a change in the proportion of patients with controlled
BP < 140/90 mm Hg (Ptime
×
registry = 0.7). Results did
not differ by PCP type (Ptime × registry × PCP type = 0.8),
CKD stage (Ptime × registry × CKD stage = 0.9), or baseline BP
control (Ptime × registry × baseline BP = 0.9; Fig 2). Random
assignment to the CKD registry was also not associated with
change in eGFR overall (Ptime × registry = 0.2); results did not
differ by baseline BP (Ptime × registry × baseline BP = 0.2) or
CKD stage (Ptime × registry × CKD stage = 0.8). Change in albu-
minuria severity was also not different by registry group
among the overall study population (Ptime × registry = 0.1) or
by PCP type (Ptime × registry × PCP type = 0.7), baseline CKD
severity (Ptime × registry × CKD stage = 0.7), or baseline BP
control (Ptime × registry × baseline BP = 0.3; Fig 3).
Random assignment to the CKD registry was associated
with greater odds of ACE inhibitor/ARB prescription
compared to the usual-care registry among all patients with
CKD (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 2.25; 95% conﬁdenceinterval
[CI], 1.45-3.49). Marginal estimates of patients with an active
ACE inhibitor/ARB prescription >50% of the time were
82.2% in the registry group compared to 68.2% in the usual-
care group. Interaction analyses demonstrated that results
differed bybaseline CKDstage(Pregistry × CKD stage = 0.002) and
bybaselineBP(Pregistry × baseline BP = 0.0004).Adjusted ORs for
predetermined subgroups aredepicted inFigure 4A. Impactof
the CKD registry on ACE inhibitor/ARB prescription also
differed by PCP type (Pregistry × PCP training = 0.002), with the
greatest impact among trainees. Odds of albuminuria
quantiﬁcation were higher among patients with CKD
whose providers were randomly assigned to the CKD
registry versus those randomly assigned to the usual-care
registry (adjusted OR, 2.44; 95% CI, 1.38-4.29). Odds
were higher among individuals with moderate (vs mild)
CKD (Pregistry × CKD stage = 0.01) and those with uncontrolled
(vs controlled) BP at baseline (Pregistry × baseline BP = 0.01).

Discussion
In our study, a safety-net primary care CKD registry
directed at the entire primary care team enhanced the
delivery of guideline-concordant CKD care, including ACE
inhibitor/ARB use and albuminuria quantiﬁcation, but did
not improve BP control or affect change in eGFR after 12
months. This success builds on prior interventions in the
United States directed toward PCPs who have moderately
improved CKD management. Studies have previously
demonstrated that automated laboratory eGFR reporting
has led to greater identiﬁcation of CKD among PCPs and
higher rates of nephrology referrals.23 Registries with
electronic decision support for PCPs have been shown to
increase serum laboratory testing for patients with kidney
disease.24
The premise of the Chronic Care Model is that well-
informed patients and adequately prepared practice teams
interact productively in a way that improves outcomes.25
The model supplies a framework for delivering high-
quality chronic disease care that relies on a team-based
primary care approach. The CKD registry we studied
aligns with the Chronic Care Model and differs from prior
kidney registry efforts by empowering nonphysician
health care providers to enhance care delivery alongside
PCPs during clinic visits with decision support and to
perform outreach and panel management outside of clinic
visits. This team-based population health approach has
been successful at improving process outcomes among
patients with multimorbidity.26 This study extends this
success to individuals with kidney disease.
ACE inhibitor/ARB prescription among patients with
kidney disease is an essential component of CKD man-
agement. A recent meta-analysis of 119 randomized
controlled trials examining the effects of ACE inhibitor or
ARB therapy on health outcomes among 64,768 patients
with all stages of CKD demonstrated that ACE inhibitors or

Original Investigation
ARBs reduced the odds of kidney failure by 30% to 39%
compared to placebo and by 25% to 35% compared with
other antihypertensive medications. Their use was also
associated with an 18% to 24% reduced odds of cardio-
vascular events compared to placebo, though these results
were not necessarily independent of BP control or albu-
minuria level.27 From the public health perspective, data
from the last decade of NHANES (National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey) suggest that the national
prevalence of CKD has stabilized overall, including among
those with CKD stages 3 and 4.28 These trends have been
observed while the application of known CKD in-
terventions, including BP control,29 glycemic control,30
and
use
of
ACE
inhibitors/ARBs,31
have
increased.
Although the cross-sectional nature of NHANES data
means that they can only imply that application of CKD
interventions has contributed to stabilization of CKD
prevalence, these data underscore the importance of our
registry’s impact on increased ACE inhibitor/ARB pre-
scription among patients with CKD.
Importantly, random assignment to the CKD registry was
associated with greater quantiﬁcation of albuminuria by
health care teams. The presence of albuminuria is a strong
risk factor for CKD progression,32 acute kidney injury,33 and
cardiovascular events34 and contributes substantially to risk
prediction models for the development of ESRD.35 Decreases
in albuminuria during a 2-year period have been associated
with lower risk for incident ESRD and death among patients
with CKD with and without diabetes.36 Measuring albu-
minuria among those with low eGFRs and pharmacologi-
cally minimizing that albuminuria is an essential component
of optimal CKD care.37 Currently, albuminuria is grossly
underascertained among those at risk for and with CKD,
particularly among individuals without diabetes.38 This gap
in evidence-based CKD care highlights the need for system-
based interventions, such as a team-based CKD registry.
Random assignment to the CKD registry was not asso-
ciated with improvement in systolic BP or greater BP con-
trol. These null results could be attributed to poor ﬁdelity of
the intervention (a common challenge for pragmatic clin-
ical trials39), poor medication adherence among patients
despite an increase in ACE inhibitor/ARB prescription in
the intervention arm, or inadequate medication dosing of
ACE inhibitors/ARBs. It could also be due to fairly well-
controlled BP at baseline, with an average systolic BP of
134 mm Hg. Results may also suggest that implementation

Original Investigation
of single elements of the Chronic Care Model (eg, access to
resources, provision of patient self-management support,
redesign of delivery systems, and team-based decision
support) within the context of a robust primary care team
may not be sufﬁcient to see improvements in clinical out-
comes. Interventions that enhance clinical outcomes, such
as BP control or change in eGFR, may need to incorporate
several elements of the Chronic Care Model. This is
consistent with data from Kaiser Permanente Northern
California, an integrated health system that previously
demonstrated marked improvements in BP control after
implementing a large-scale hypertension program40 that
consisted of a hypertension registry with in-reach and
outreach components, as well as delivery system redesign
with medical assistant visits for BP measurements and
increased provider access to BP treatment algorithms.
Similar data for the management of other chronic diseases
have emerged from the North Carolina Improving Perfor-
mance in Practice program, which found that better
cholesterol levels in patients with diabetes were associated
in a graded fashion with the degree to which clinical
practices
adopted
components
of
multilevel
in-
terventions.41 Improving BPs among patients with CKD in
safety-net settings may thus require interventions that
synergistically target health systems and patients because
patients face additional challenges to optimal health care,
including low health literacy and food insecurity.42
This study’s results must be taken in the context of its
limitations. All patients with 2 abnormal eGFRs or albu-
minuria separated by 3 months were considered to have
CKD. However, the registry could not exclude individuals
with acute kidney injury or ascertain complications of
increased ACE inhibitor/ARB prescription such as hyper-
kalemia, though the prevalence of these complications
would not likely differ by trial arm. Also, this pragmatic
trial was subject to the information technology constraints
of the reporting tools inherent to the electronic health
record used in the safety-net health delivery system. As
such, medication data were not available at baseline; ACE
inhibitor/ARB prescription became available shortly after
study implementation. The cluster randomized approach
to randomization led to differing numbers of PCPs and
patients per arm, with more trainees randomly assigned to
the usual-care arm. Although this difference was not
anticipated, the number of trainees was not statistically
signiﬁcantly different by study arm. Reassuringly, preva-
lence of uncontrolled diabetes, uncontrolled BP, and severe
CKD among patients was also not different by study arm.
Poor ﬁdelity of the intervention or contamination across
study arms despite team (vs provider) random assignment
could have contributed to smaller differences in BPs than
anticipated between the study arms. These challenges,
common to pragmatic trials, should be considered along-
side the value afforded by this type of study design,

including participation of a diverse patient population,
direct application of the intervention to patient care, and
external validity.39
In conclusion, a primary care registry directed toward
the entire health care team with point-of-care alerts and
outreach lists can improve essential CKD processes of care.
In the context of health care reform and the evolution of
patient-centered medical homes with team-based chronic
care delivery, this has wide public health implications.
Although this study needs to be replicated in a larger de-
livery system with long-term outcomes, adoption of team-
based CKD registries may represent an important step of
translating evidence into practice for CKD management,
particularly in health delivery systems that care for patient
populations with a high burden of kidney disease.

Introduction: Unprovoked venous thromboembolism (VTE) may be the first manifestation of an undiagnosed
cancer.
We
assessed
the
cost-effectiveness
of
18F-Fluorodesoxyglucose
Positron
Emission/Computed
Tomography (FDG PET/CT) plus limited screening and limited screening strategies in patients with unprovoked
VTE from the perspectives of the Ontario (Canada) and French health care systems.
Methods: We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis based on a published randomized controlled trial of 394
patients aged 18 years or older who were diagnosed with unprovoked VTE. We obtained data with respect to
efficacy and health care utilization from the published trial. The primary measure of effectiveness was the
number of avoided cases of delayed cancer diagnosis and the secondary measure of effectiveness was the quality
adjusted life year (QALY) at the end of the study in each group. We used generalized linear models to estimate
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) while controlling for patient demographic and clinical character-
istics. Results were presented as the incremental cost to avoid one case of delayed cancer diagnosis and the
incremental cost per QALY gained. The 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using bootstrap re-
sampling procedures with 5000 iterations.
Results: Compared to a limited screening strategy, the ICER of limited strategy plus FDG PET/CT scan was C$
26,840.19 (95% CI: C$ 24,046.51; C$ 34,581.53) per one avoided case of delayed cancer diagnosis from the
Ontario health system perspective and €16,370.45 (95% CI: € 9904.48; € 39,578.91) per one avoided case of
delayed cancer diagnosis from the French health system perspective. The probabilities that addition of FDG PET/
CT to limited screening is cost-effective rose with increasing willingness to pay values. Compared with the
limited screening, the extensive screening was associated with C$ 3412.85 per QALY gained (95% CI: 1463.89;
−13,935.88) from the Ontario health system perspective and €2162.83 per QALY gained (95% CI 958.78;
−10,544.42) from the French health system perspective.
Conclusion: Addition of a FDG PET/CT for occult cancer diagnosis was associated with better health outcomes

(fewer cases of delayed cancer diagnosis and greater QALYs) and a higher cost from the perspective of publicly
funded health care systems; the cost-effectiveness results are however highly uncertain.
1. Introduction
Venous thromboembolism (VTE), which encompasses deep-vein
thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), can be the earliest
sign of cancer [1–5]. It was previously demonstrated that between 6%
to 15% of patients presenting with unprovoked VTE will be diagnosed
with cancer in the year following the diagnosis of an unprovoked VTE
episode (i.e. VTE not provoked by a major risk factor) [6]. Recent
studies reported that approximately 5% of patients are diagnosed with
cancer within the first year following VTE diagnosis [7,8].
Identifying occult cancers at the time of VTE diagnosis may lead to
significant improvement of patient care since the cancer may be at a
curable stage and early cancer treatment might prevent cancer-asso-
ciated morbidity. However, the extent to which patients with un-
provoked VTE should be screened for occult cancer is still controversial.
Two recent randomized controlled trials failed to demonstrate that an
extensive screening strategy for occult cancer provides a clinically-
significant benefit in patients with unprovoked VTE [7,8]. The SOME
trial failed to demonstrate the superiority of a limited cancer screening
strategy plus a comprehensive Computed Tomography (CT) of the ab-
domen and pelvis over a limited cancer screening strategy alone on the
proportion of avoided cases of delayed cancer diagnosis in patients with
a first unprovoked VTE [7]. Moreover, the MVTEP trial also failed to
demonstrate the superiority of a limited cancer screening strategy plus
18F-Fluorodesoxyglucose Positron Emission/Computed Tomography
(FDG PET/CT) over a limited cancer screening strategy alone on the
proportion of cancers diagnosed during the screening period [8].
Nevertheless, a secondary outcome analysis of the MVTEP trial showed
that FDG PET/CT significantly reduced the number of delayed cancer
diagnosis cases in comparison to limited screening alone (absolute risk
difference 4.1%, 95% CI: 0.8 to 8.4%, p = 0.01).
Despite potential health benefits, little is known about whether the
addition of FDG PET/CT would increase or decrease the health system
cost. Few studies have been conducted that reported the financial im-
plications of extensive screening for occult cancer diagnosis among
patients with unprovoked VTE [9,10]; however, none of these studies
focused on FDG PET/CT. The Trousseau study suggested that extensive
screening using abdominal and chest Computed Tomography (CT)
scans and mammography was associated with higher mean costs
(€530.92 for extensive screening vs. €165.17 for limited screening)
[10]. Another cost-effectiveness study using data collected alongside
the SOME trial found that the addition of a comprehensive CT scan to
limited screening was associated with higher costs (C$551) with no
significant improvement in utility values or number of avoided cases of
delayed cancer diagnosis [9].
The aim of this study was to assess the cost effectiveness of an ex-
tensive screening strategy including a FDG PET/CT in addition to a
limited screening in comparison with a limited screening alone from the
publicly funded health care system perspective in patients with un-
provoked VTE.
2. Methods
2.1. Study design
We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis based on a published
open label, multicenter, randomized study (MVTEP) that compared a
screening strategy based on FDG PET/CT with a limited screening
strategy for detection of occult malignant disease in patients with un-
provoked VTE [8].
Briefly, the study included patients aged 18 years or older, diag-
nosed with unprovoked VTE who did not present any exclusion criteria:
ongoing pregnancy, active malignancy (defined as known malignancy,
active and/or treated during the previous five years).
Patients were randomized into two arms. In the limited screening
arm, patients underwent medical history, complete physical examina-
tion, routine laboratory tests including complete blood count, ery-
throcyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein, transaminases, al-
kaline phosphatase, calcium, chest X-ray, and recommended age- and
gender-specific cancer screening tests (i.e. prostate-specific antigen in
men over 50 years of age, mammography in women over 50 years of
age and Pap-smear in all women). In the limited plus FDG PET/CT arm,
patients underwent the same limited screening plus a FDG PET/CT.
All patients underwent clinical follow up every 6 months for
24 months. In case of positive finding on initial screening or during
follow up, patients were referred for appropriate diagnostic procedures
at the discretion of the treating physician. All patients provided written
informed consent. The study was conducted in accordance with the
ethical principles set forth in the Declaration of Helsinki, Good Clinical
Practice, and relevant French regulations regarding ethics and data
protection. The protocol was approved for all study sites by our in-
stitutional Ethics committee (Comité de Protection des Personnes Ouest
VI,
2008-541).
The
study
was
registered
on
clinicaltrials.gov
(NCT00964275).
2.2. Resource utilization and cost
We chose the perspective of the publicly funded health care systems:
Ontario, Canada and France. For each trial participant, we estimated
the total health system cost over the entire study period (i.e.
24 months). Patient health resource use associated with screening
strategies was obtained from the trial data.
The unit costs for the Ontario health care system perspective were
extracted from the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care
Schedule of Benefits [11]. The schedule of laboratory fees was used to
estimate the costs of lab tests [12]. The unit cost of a FDG PET/CT for
the Ontario health system perspective was taken from CADTH Optimal
Use Report - 2012 and was inflated to 2017 prices using a consumer
price index, Statistics Canada [13] (see Appendices, Table A1). The unit
costs for the French health system perspective were taken from the
Classification Commune des Actes Médicaux version 49 [14]. In-
formation regarding the laboratory fees and the unit cost of a FDG PET/
CT for the French health system perspective was elicited from clinicians
(see Appendices, Table A2). Costs were presented in Canadian dollars
(C$) for the Ontario health system perspective and in Euros (€) for the
French Health system perspective.
The following health resource components were included in total
health system costs: costs of screening and diagnostic tests, costs of
additional procedures conducted at the physician's discretion and costs
of specialist physician consultations at initial screening and during
follow-up visits.
2.3. Analysis
We adopted a time horizon of two years to capture costs of addi-
tional tests carried out at the physician's discretion during follow up.
As the base case analysis, a secondary outcome measure of the
primary trial was used as the primary outcome for this cost effective-
ness analysis. We measured the effectiveness of the screening strategies
as the number of avoided cases of delayed cancer diagnosis. A delayed

cancer diagnosis case referred to a patient who was diagnosed as
cancer-free at the initial screening but was identified as having cancer
during follow-up period. Data regarding cancer diagnosis at screening
and follow up, patient demographic, and risk factors were obtained
from the trial.
Because the trial did not collect health utility values, we obtained
the utility weights from the published literature, approximated QALY
for patients in each screening group and performed a cost-utility ana-
lysis as a secondary analysis. The QALY for each patient was calculated
by multiplying the patient's life expectancy with the associated health
utility value. For patients who were not diagnosed with cancer
throughout the trial period, the QALY was calculated using estimates of
life expectancy [15] and utility norm obtained from the Canadian po-
pulation [16]. For patients diagnosed with cancer at initial screening,
the QALY was calculated using estimated life expectancy [17] and
utility associated with cancer diagnosis [18]. For patients who received
a negative test result at the initial screening but were later diagnosed
with cancer during follow-up visits, QALY was calculated using esti-
mated life expectancy associated with cancer diagnosis [17] and utility
associated with a false negative cancer screening result [19]. Estimates
of life expectancy and utility weights used in the cost utility analysis
have been described in Table A3 (see Appendices).
Base case and secondary analyses were performed according to in-
tention-to-treat (ITT) principle. A net-benefit regression framework was
used to estimate the incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) and the
incremental net benefit (INB). The ICER is defined as the difference in
costs of two alternative strategies divided by the difference in their
effect. The net benefit was estimated from the willingness to pay (WTP),
cost and effect [nbi = WTP ∗effecti −cos ti] [20,21].
For the base case analysis, effecti was measured as a binary variable
taking a value ‘1’ if a cancer diagnosis was delayed for patient i;
otherwise zero. For the secondary analysis, effecti was measured as the
QALY measured at the end of the study for patient i. WTP represents the
maximum amount a decision maker would be willing to pay for one
unit of health outcome, i.e. one delayed cancer diagnosis case or one
QALY gained. Since a WTP threshold is arbitrary, net benefit values
were calculated for each participant in the study using a wide range of
WTP values between C$0 and C$100,000 for the Ontario health system
perspective and between €0 and €100,000 for the French health system
perspective. With net benefit values for each participant, we ran a
generalized linear model regression for each WTP to calculate INB and
ICER. The specification of family function and link structure and se-
lection of covariates was guided by the Akaike Information Criteria and
the Bayesian Information Criteria. The regression controlled for base-
line covariates of age equal to or above 50 years, gender, current
weight, smoking status, use of alcohol, use of hormones (oral contra-
ceptives or hormone replacement therapy), previous VTE and type,
family history of cancer, personal history of malignancy, asbestos ex-
posure, ionisant radiation exposure and chemical products exposure.
There were no missing values with respect to baseline variables or
outcome variables used in this analysis.
We characterized the statistical uncertainty by estimating 95%
confidence
intervals
(CIs)
using
a
non-parametric
bootstrapping
method. Based on 5000 iterations, we created cost-effectiveness ac-
ceptability curves (CEACs), which link the probability of a treatment
being cost-effective over a range of threshold values that a decision
maker may be willing to pay to avoid a delayed cancer diagnosis.
A per protocol analysis was carried out by excluding patients of the
treatment group (extensive strategy) who did not receive a FDG PET/CT
(23 patients in the extensive screening group) at initial screening.
3. Results
Between March 3, 2009, and August 18, 2012, 748 patients were
assessed for eligibility, and 399 were included and randomized to one
of the two study groups. 200 patients were allocated to the FDG PET/CT
group, and 199 to the limited screening group. Five patients, three in
the FDG PET/CT group and two in the limited screening group, with-
drew consent and refused further use of their study data. We excluded
two patients in the extensive screening group from analysis because
VTE was not confirmed at baseline for these patients. Thus, 197 patients
in the limited screening group and 195 patients in the extensive
screening group were analyzed. Baseline characteristics of the popula-
tion are presented in Table 1.
Eleven patients (5.6%) were diagnosed with cancer at the initial
screening in the FDG PET/CT group compared to four (2.0%) patients
in the limited screening group (p = 0.07). There was one patient with
delayed cancer diagnosis (0.5%) in the FDG PET/CT group versus nine
patients (4.7%) in the limited screening group (p = 0.01), suggesting
the eight avoided cases of delayed cancer diagnosis as result of the
extensive screening group (p = 0.01).
3.1. Total cost of screening strategies per patient
Total cost per patient at initial screening, during follow up and over
the entire study period (screening and follow-up visits) from the
Ontario health system perspective and the French health system per-
spective are presented in Table 2. For both health care systems, the
primary cost driver at initial screening for patients in the extensive
screening group was the cost of the FDG PET/CT scan (see Appendices,
Fig. 1A, Tables A1, A2).
During follow-up visits, the cumulative cost of additional tests was
higher among patients in the limited screening group in comparison to
that in the extensive screening group (see Appendices, Fig. 1B).
Over the entire study period (inclusive of screening and follow-up
visits), the incremental cost of adding a FDG PET/CT to a limited
screening strategy was estimated to be C$1112.33 per patient from the
Ontario health care perspective, and €720.63 per patient from the
French health care perspective in comparison with a limited screening
strategy alone.
3.2. Cost-effectiveness of adding a FDG PET/CT to a limited screening
strategy
From
the
Ontario
health
system
perspective,
the
ICER
was
C$26,840.19 (95% CI: C$ 24,046.51; C$ 34,581.53) per one avoided
case of delayed cancer diagnosis. The INB values were positive when
the WTP values were greater than C$26,840.19, suggesting the addition
of a FDG PET/CT to a limited screening strategy would be cost-effective
if decision makers are willing to pay at least C$26,840.19 to avoid one
case of delayed cancer diagnosis (see Appendices, Fig. 2).
From the French health system perspective, the incremental cost per

one avoided case of delayed cancer diagnosis using a limited strategy
plus a FDG PET/CT scan was €16,370.45 (95% CI: € 9904.48; €
39,578.91) compared to limited screening. The INB values were posi-
tive for WTP values greater than €16,370.45, suggesting that the ad-
dition of a FDG PET/CT to a limited screening strategy would be cost
effective if decision makers are willing to pay at least €16,370.45 to
prevent one case of delayed cancer diagnosis from the French health
system perspective (see Appendices, Fig. 3). The 95% CIs around the
INB estimates were wider at greater levels of WTP, showing higher
uncertainty with higher WTP for both the Ontario health system per-
spective and the French health system perspective (see Appendices,
Fig. 2 and Fig. 3).
The cost-effectiveness planes (see Appendices, Fig. 4 and Fig. 5)
represent
the
cost-effectiveness
ratios
comparing
the
extensive
screening to the limited screening. Of 5000 bootstrap replications,
99.7% fall in the top right quadrant, suggesting that extensive screening
is more costly and associated with fewer avoided cases of delayed
cancer diagnosis.
Subgroup analyses were planned to be performed for the following
variables: gender, age (< 50 and ≥50), smoking status, alcohol, hor-
mone, previous VTE and VTE type, family history of cancer, personal
history of cancer and asbestos exposure. However, no significant in-
teractions were observed between the treatment indicator and con-
founding variables suggesting that cost effectiveness of extensive
screening compared to limited screening did not vary by subgroup.
3.3. Per protocol analysis
We conducted a per protocol analysis by excluding patients who did
not receive an FDG PET/CT (23 patients) in the extensive screening
group. The results from this analysis were comparable to those obtained
from the ITT analysis. Detailed results of the per protocol analysis are
shown under Section 3 of the Appendices.
3.4. Scenario analysis
Compared to the limited screening strategy, the incremental cost per
QALY gained was C$ 3412.85 (95% CI: 1463.89; −13,935.88) from the
Ontario health system perspective and €2162.83 (95% CI 958.78;
−10,544.42) from the French health system perspective. A negative
ICER in the upper bound suggested the possibility that the extensive
screening was associated with a higher cost and fewer QALY gained
compared to the limited screening strategy. If the willingness to pay per
one QALY gained is C$50,000, the probability of extensive screening
being
cost
effective
is
89.7%
from
the
Ontario
health
system
perspective (see Appendices, Fig. 8). If the willingness to pay per one
QALY gained is €50,000, the probability of extensive screening being
cost effective is 90.22% from the French health system perspective (see
Appendices, Fig. 9). Given the health utility weight associated with
delayed cancer diagnosis is unknown, we conducted additional analyses
using the upper and lower bounds of the health utility values associated
with a false negative cancer screening result to reflect the uncertainty
associated with this value (see Appendices, Figs. 10 and 11).
4. Discussion
This post-hoc analysis of the MVTEP trial showed that a screening
strategy including a FDG PET/CT is more expensive but associated with
fewer avoided cases of delayed cancer diagnosis than a limited
screening alone in patients with unprovoked VTE. The cost effective-
ness of the extensive screening strategy did not vary significantly be-
tween health systems because the unit cost of a FDG PET/CT scan was
comparable between Ontario and France.
We observed that the incremental cost of adding a FDG PET/CT to a
limited screening strategy was approximately C$1112 per patient from
the Ontario health system perspective and €721 per patient from the
French health system perspective in comparison with a limited
screening strategy alone over the entire study period. The primary cost
driver in the extensive screening strategy was the cost of the FDG PET/
CT scan, i.e. C$ 1133.17 per FDG PET/CT scan in Ontario and €733 per
FDG PET/CT scan in France. This additional cost is higher than that
reported in previous studies assessing cost analyses of extensive
screening strategies in patients with unprovoked VTE [9,10]. The cost-
effectiveness analysis using data collected during the SOME trial, re-
ported that the addition of a CT scan of the abdomen/pelvis to a limited
screening strategy was associated with an increased cost of C$551
without providing a clinically significant benefit in comparison with
limited screening alone [9]. The same conclusion has been established
in the cost analysis of the Trousseau prospective cohort study, with an
increase in cost of €365.75 [10].
Although the use of extensive screening might lead to a reduction of
the number of further diagnostic tests performed during follow up
compared to limited screening, the difference in costs of additional tests
per patient during follow up between the limited screening group and
the extensive screening group was not large enough to offset the cost of
a FDG PET/CT. Results were similar for both the Ontario and French
health system perspectives.
The incremental cost per one avoided case of delayed cancer diag-
nosis observed in the extensive screening (limited screening plus FDG
PET/CT) group was estimated to be approximately C$ 26,840 from the

Ontario health system perspective and €16,370 from the French health
system perspective. This incremental cost per one avoided case of de-
layed cancer diagnosis by adding a FDG PET/CT to a limited screening
strategy is lower than the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio described
in the cost-effectiveness analysis of the SOME trial [9]. In such study,
Coyle et al. reported that an extensive screening including a compre-
hensive CT scan of the abdomen/pelvis was associated with the incre-
mental cost of C$631,803 per one avoided case of delayed cancer di-
agnosis compared to limited screening alone among patients with
unprovoked VTE.
In our study, the cost effectiveness planes for delayed cancer diag-
nosis avoided’ when comparing extensive screening and limited
screening showed that 99.7% of the cost-effect pairs are in the top right
(i.e. North-East) quadrant suggesting that an extensive screening is
more costly but associated with fewer avoided cases of delayed cancer
diagnosis. Cost-effectiveness planes are used to visually represent the
differences in costs and health outcomes between occult cancer
screening strategies alternatives by plotting the difference in costs
against difference in health outcomes. In other words, an extensive
screening strategy based on FDG PET/CT is more expensive than a
limited screening alone but also generates more “health gain” (i.e.
fewer delayed cancer diagnosis cases).
Our study has few limitations. First, the incidence of occult cancer
diagnosed in MVTEP was lower than expected, limiting the statistical
power of our study to detect potential variations of cost-effectiveness
findings across pre-planned subgroups. Secondly, rare events during
follow up in our population of patients resulted in high uncertainty in
the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio estimates. Along the same lines,
we were unable to detect variations in treatment effects by subgroup
and this may also be due to rare events especially in the extensive
screening group. Future studies are therefore required to better define
the risks and benefits of an extensive occult cancer-screening strategy in
high-risk patients sub-group with unprovoked VTE. Thirdly, results of
this cost-effectiveness analysis are hypothesis generating because a
secondary outcome measure of the primary trial was used as the pri-
mary outcome for this cost effectiveness analysis (i.e. number of
avoided cases of delayed cancer diagnosis and thus diagnosed during
follow up). Moreover, our exploratory cost-utility analysis was based on
data obtained from the published literature as the MVTEP trial did not
measure health utility values. We performed a literature search to
identify utility values associated with delayed cancer diagnosis but did
not identify any relevant studies. Consequently, we assumed the utility
value associated with delayed cancer diagnosis to be equal to the utility
weight associated with a false negative breast cancer screening test. We
assessed the uncertainty around this utility value by repeating the cost-
utility analysis using the lower and upper bounds of the utility value.
The results showed that the extensive screening strategy became more
cost-effective, i.e. lower cost per QALY gained, with lower utility values
associated delayed cancer diagnosis.
This cost-effectiveness analysis only assessed the cost of cancer
screening strategies (i.e. cancer diagnosis) but we were unable to ad-
dress the cost effectiveness for patient cancer management. A recently
published systematic review with individual participant data meta-
analysis showed that there is a trend towards more early-stage cancer
detected when using extensive screening strategies in comparison with
limited screening alone [22]. If the addition of a FDG PET/CT to a
limited screening strategy leads to fewer avoided cases of delayed
cancer diagnoses than a limited screening alone, this could be asso-
ciated with lower cost for patient cancer management, considering less
duration of treatment or less need for chemotherapy.
Finally, the aim of the analysis was to assess whether the health
outcome gained from extensive cancer screening justifies its cost.
Admittedly, when it comes to evidence-based decision making, eco-
nomic evaluation evidence is only one part of the process. The decision
should be supported by evidence regarding clinical effectiveness as well
as the ethical, legal, and social implications of the intervention on
patient health and the health care system. Overall, we believe that
further studies are needed to better assess the impact of earlier diag-
nosis by extensive screening, in terms of quality of life or overall
prognosis.
In conclusion, in this post-hoc analysis of the MVTEP trial, we found
that the addition of a FDG PET/CT scan to a limited screening strategy
for occult cancer diagnosis is more expensive than a limited screening
strategy alone but leads to fewer delayed cancer diagnosis cases.
Extensive screening also leads to a gain in QALY for patients compared
to the limited screening strategy. An extensive screening strategy in-
cluding a FDG PET/CT as a single additional test might be economically
attractive from both the Ontario and French health care system per-
spectives.

India's cervical cancer screening program was launched in 2016. We evaluated baseline facility readiness using
nationally representative data from the 2012–13 District Level Household and Facility Survey on 4 tiers of the
public health care system - 18,367 sub-health centres (SHCs), 8540 primary health centres (PHCs), 4810 com-
munity health centres and 1540 district/sub-divisional hospitals. To evaluate facility readiness we used the
Improving Data for Decision Making in Global Cervical Cancer Programmes toolkit on six domains - potential
staffing, infrastructure, equipment and supplies, infection prevention, medicines and laboratory testing, and data
management. Composite scores were created by summing responses within domains, standardizing scores across
domains at each facility level, and averaging across districts/states.
Overall, readiness scores were low for cervical cancer screening. At SHCs, the lowest scores were observed in
‘infrastructure’ (0.55) and ‘infection prevention’ (0.44), while PHCs had low ‘potential staffing’ scores (0.50) due
to limited manpower to diagnose and treat (cryotherapy) potential cases. Scores were higher for tiers conducting
diagnostic work-up and treatment/referral. The highest scores were in ‘potential staffing’ except for PHCs, while
the lowest scores were in ‘infection & prevention’ and ‘medicines and laboratory’. Goa and Maharashtra were
consistently among the top 5 ranking states for readiness.
Substantial heterogeneity in facility readiness for cervical cancer screening spans states and tiers of India's
public healthcare system. Infrastructure and staffing are large barriers to screening at PHCs, which are crucial for
referral of high-risk patients. Our results suggest focus areas in cervical cancer screening at the district level for
policy makers.
1. Introduction
In India, over 410,000 new cervical cancer cases and 228,000
deaths occur every year (GLOBOCAN 2018). Though low-cost, feasible,
early detection methods are available, most cervical cancer cases are
diagnosed at advanced stages (Krishnan et al., 2015). Aligned with
WHO recommendations for a screen-and-treat approach in low-resource
settings (World Health Organization, 2013; Bagcchi, 2016; Shastri
et al., 2014; Sankaranarayanan et al., 2007), India implemented uni-
versal cervical cancer screening by visual inspection with acetic acid
(VIA) at primary health care facilities, as part of the Comprehensive
Primary Health Care Programme of Ayushman Bharat and National

Programme for Prevention and Control of Cardiovascular Disease,
Diabetes, Cancer and Stroke (NPCDCS) (Ministry of Health and Family
Welfare GoI, 2016; Ministry of Health and Family Welfare GoI, n.d.).
The guidelines recommend nationwide cervical cancer screening for
women aged 30–65 years once every 5 years with reliance primarily on
the VIA (Government of India, 2016).
India's primary health care system - traditionally focused on re-
productive and child health needs - consists of a four-tier facility hier-
archy starting from the sub-health centre (SHC), which is largely fo-
cused on health promotion, nutrition, and immunization, as a first point
of contact with the community (Table 1). Second tier facilities are
Primary Health Centres (PHC), which provide preventive and curative
services and are staffed with a medical officer. Community Health
Centres (CHC) are third tier facilities, which provide PHC services as
well as emergency and lab services; and CHC's implement national
health programmes such as those focused on non-communicable dis-
eases (NCDs). The fourth and final tier includes the district hospital/sub
divisional hospital (DH), with stronger staffing, specialist services, re-
sources and 24-h emergency care. According to the operational guide-
lines, breast, cervical and oral cancer screening should occur primarily
at the SHC and PHC levels, and all four levels are engaged for referral of
suspicious lesions and diagnostic follow-up.
For the present study, we assessed facility readiness for cervical
cancer screening at all four levels of the health care system prior to the
initiation of universal screening of common NCDs in 2016 utilizing data
from the nationally representative District Level Health and Facility
Survey-4 (DLHS-4) conducted during 2012–2013 (Ministry of Health
and Family Welfare GoI, 2016; National Health System Resource
Centre, n.d.).
2. Data and methods
2.1. Data source
The
District
Level
Household
and
Facility
Survey
(DLHS-4,
2012–13) is the fourth government-conducted nationwide health
survey on the utilization and quality of maternal and child healthcare
services in India at the district level (http://www.rchiips.org/DLHS-4.
html). Four questionnaires were administered to survey each of the four
facility levels. Information at each health facility was collected by
surveying relevant personnel, physical inspections, and assessing reg-
isters.
The DLHS-4 data includes health care facilities from 26 states and 3
union territories including all 1540 DHs and 4810 CHCs, and a re-
presentative sample of 8540 PHCs, and 18,367 SHCs. Data from two
states (Gujarat, Jammu and Kashmir) and four union territories (Dadra
and Nagar Haveli, Daman and Diu, Delhi, and Lakshadweep) were not
available for analysis.
2.2. Assessing health facility readiness to implement cervical cancer
screening
To assess health facility readiness for cervical cancer screening, we
utilized the Improving Data for Decision Making in Global Cervical
Cancer Programmes (IDCCP) Toolkit which provides a framework of
indicators to assess facility readiness to implement cervical cancer
screening programmes in low-and middle-income country settings
(Drummond et al., 2017; Senkomago et al., 2017; World Health
Organization, 2018). The IDCCP toolkit contains 13 categories and 83
questions, ranging from 2 to 14 questions per category, and 0–2 points
per question (Drummond et al., 2017; Senkomago et al., 2017; World
Health Organization, 2018).
For this analysis, we used the IDCCP toolkit developed by the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the George W. Bush
Institute and the World Health Organization to find exact/comparable
matches from the health facility questionnaires at each of the 4 health
care levels, and found 6 out of 13 categories met these criteria in DLHS-
4: potential staffing, infrastructure, equipment and supplies, infection
prevention, medicines and laboratory testing, and data management
(see Appendix 1–4). In brief, the potential staffing category assesses if
the health facility has staff capable for training in 10 different cervical
cancer-screening methodologies. The infrastructure category assesses if
the health facility has the proper infrastructure (e.g. running water,
examination room, electricity, etc.) to carry out cervical cancer
screening. The equipment and supplies category is focused on the ne-
cessary equipment to conduct different cervical cancer screening
methodologies included in the IDCCP toolkit. The infection prevention
category measures if the health facility has the proper sterilization
equipment and disposes of biomedical waste appropriately. Medicines
and laboratory testing ensures that essential items such as pain medi-
cation, reproductive tract infection (RTI)/ sexually transmitted infec-
tions (STI) medication, and pregnancy tests are available. Finally, the
data management category ensures that appropriate staff and materials
are in place to allow for adequate recordkeeping. The DH questionnaire
included two additional categories - services, which measured if the
health facility was currently performing cervical cancer screening ser-
vices, and procurement and supply chain, which assessed if the DH
regularly assessed, monitored, and ensured a reliable stock of their
equipment and supply levels.
The IDCCP toolkit along with the Indian Public Health Standards
(IPHS) (Nicholson et al., 2018) were used to determine best practices
standards for each indicator, and the scoring for each question.
2.3. Statistical analysis
We used a binary system of scoring (0,1 for absent & present) since
we were relying on secondary data collected for other purposes. For
each question, the health facility received 1 point if they responded
with an answer that met the identified standard and 0 points for any
alternative response. For questions in which the IDCCP toolkit and IPHS
were discordant on the appropriate response, the IPHS prevailed. The
IDCCP questions for the six analyzed categories (and seven for DH), the
corresponding questions from the DLHS-4, and the selected responses
for the SHC, PHC, CHC, and DH can be found in Appendix 1–4, re-
spectively. The assigned scores represent whether the measured re-
sources are absent (0) or fully available (1) based on in-person visits of
health facilities. Raw scores were calculated for each of the categories
by summing all selected questions (classified as 1 for present, 0 for
absent) in that category. To allow for comparability between categories,
standardized scores were generated by dividing the raw scores by the
number of selected questions included in each respective category. An
overall score was calculated by taking an average of the standardized
scores in each category, ensuring that each category received equal
weight. Average category/overall scores were then stratified by health
facility level and state. Maps were created at the district level using the
overall score category for each health facility level. As scores across
health facility levels are not comparable, quintile categories were cal-
culated for each health facility level.
Prior to calculating PHC and SHC scores at the state level, districts
were weighted based on the number of PHCs or SHCs they contained
relative to those in the state. The distribution of health facilities by state
and district was obtained from Rural Health Statistics for 2011–2012
(Government of India, 2013). No weighting was conducted at the CHC
or DH level, as every health facility in sampled states and territories was
selected. Maps were created at the district level, stratified by health
facility level and score category. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to
reflect changes of health personnel training from the initial roll-out,
which was modified based on low SHC preparedness; instead, VIA
training was taking place at the PHC level only instead of SHCs, and
loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) or colposcopy proce-
dures were conducted by obstetrician/gynecologists instead of other
health providers/personnel.

3. Ethical considerations
This study is a secondary analysis of de-identified publicly available
national databases. All participants provided written informed consent
to participate in the survey. The DLHS-4 received ethics approval from
the International Institute for Population Science's Ethical Review
Board and the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of
India.
4. Results
Overall, two adjacent states in western India - Goa and Maharashtra
- ranked in the top 5 in three out of four health facility levels; no state
ranked in the top 5 for all 4 levels of India's public healthcare system
(Tables 2–5). For union territories - smaller administrative and geo-
graphical units - Chandigarh (north), Puducherry (south) and Andaman
and Nicobar Islands ranked in the top 5 for three out of four health care
levels. Maharashtra, despite being populous and large, also performed
more consistently at the district-level (e.g., limited variation across the
districts) – the overall composite score varied from 0.76 to 0.91, 0.62 to
0.78, 0.76 to 0.90 and 0.76 to 0.99 at the four levels of health facilities
(Fig. 1). Scores closer to 1.0 indicate better preparedness in reaching a
maximum score. Further explanation of how to interpret these scores
are listed below, which presents findings for each facility level and
category score, across the states and union territories of India.
4.1. Facility readiness at the Sub-Health Centre (SHC) level
For SHCs, the mean overall composite score was 0.70 (min, max:
0.48, 0.84, Table 2). The lowest and highest scores were observed in the
north-east (e.g., Manipur and Sikkim, respectively). ‘Potential staffing’
had the highest scores; 93.6% of SHCs had an auxiliary nurse midwife
(ANM) and/or female health worker available to perform VIA (Ap-
pendix 1) - although there was wide variation by state (Table 2) and
district (Fig. 1). Two small states in the north-east achieved perfect
scores for potential staffing – Nagaland and Sikkim – indicating that an
ANM, female health worker, or contractual additional ANM were
staffed at all sub-centres in the sampled districts. Another category with
overall high scores for the nation (0.87) was ‘Data Management’ where
most of the facilities had available registers (95%), supplied their data
in Health management information system (HMIS) format (92%), and
had an ANM performing data entry (75%, Appendix 1). The lowest
category scores (0.44) were observed in ‘Infection Prevention’, which
was driven by the low proportion of SHCs with an available and
functional autoclave for sterilizing equipment (27%) and only 39%
properly disposed of hazardous/infectious waste. This category also had
considerable variation with a > 3-fold difference across states (e.g.,
Arunachal Pradesh, 0.17, Haryana 0.62). There was also substantial
SHC score variation at the district-level; in Kerala, composite scores
varied from 0.44 in Kasaragod district to 0.90 in Idukki district.
4.2. Facility readiness at the Primary Health Centre (PHC) level
The mean overall composite PHC score was 0.56 (min, max – 0.31,
0.78) with the highest scores in smaller (Goa, 0.74), and larger states

(Haryana, 0.74, Table 3). The lowest scoring states were low income
states that lag behind in demographic, epidemiological transitions
(Dandona et al., 2017) and infant mortality rate reductions (Uttar
Pradesh, 0.33). The highest performing PHC categories were ‘Equip-
ment and Supplies’ (mean score- 0.78) and ‘Infrastructure’ (mean score
– 0.64) with top-ranking states in the west, south and north (Mahar-
ashtra, 0.97 and 0.87, Tamil Nadu, 0.97 and 0.87, and Haryana, 0.96
and 0.88, respectively). The lowest scoring category was ‘Medicines and
Laboratory’ with an overall score of 0.30 and a 48-fold level of variation
across states. Only 14.1% of PHCs had all 4 antibiotics recommended by
the IPHS for treatment of cervicitis and sexually transmitted infections
per national guidelines (Appendix 2). Less than a quarter of PHCs
(23.4%) had a ‘medical officer’ (classified as ‘lady medical officers’ on
the questionnaire), which contributed to the lower scores for ‘Potential
Staffing’ at this health facility level (Appendix 2). One-third of PHCs
met IPHS standards for communication equipment – having a func-
tioning telephone, computer and internet.
4.3. Facility readiness at the Community Health Centre (CHC) level
Nationwide, CHCs had an overall composite score of 0.76, with
higher scores in general than SHCs and PHCs (Table 4). The highest
scoring states catered to smaller geographic areas and populations eg,
(Sikkim, 0.87). ‘Potential Staffing’ scored the highest (mean = 0.96)
with nearly one third of states (n = 9) reaching a perfect score of 1.0;
these 9 states included 4 with smaller populations (eg, Chandigarh), 4
in the north-east (eg, Meghalaya) and 1 in the west (West Bengal). The
lowest scoring category for CHC's was ‘Medicines and Laboratory’
(mean = 0.52) with less than a quarter (23.6%) stocked with the re-
productive tract infection/sexually transmitted drugs under the Re-
productive and Child Health Programme (Appendix 3).
4.4. Facility readiness at the district/sub-divisional hospital (SDH) level
DH/SDH category scores, which included 2 new domains –
‘Services’ and ‘Procurement and Supply chain’, were on average, higher
than those of CHCs, and the highest scoring states were smaller in size
and population (eg, Puducherry, 0.96, Table 5). Sixty-nine percent of
DHs conducted Pap smear testing (‘Services’) and 96% of hospitals
maintained stock registers for equipment and supplies yielding perfect
scores for a majority of states in ‘Procurement and Supply Chain. Ca-
tegories with the highest overall scores included ‘Potential Staffing’
(mean =0.98) and ‘Procurement and Supply Chain’ (mean = 0.96)
with perfect scores for 18 states in staffing and for 9 states in pro-
curement/supply chain. On average, 97% of DH's had staff that could
be trained to perform all of the methodologies with a maximum score
observed across high-income states such as Goa and Chandigarh, as well
as low-income states such as Odisha and Jharkhand. Of the nation's
DH's, 89% could provide STI treatment, 90% had pregnancy and 65%
had human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) tests available. A close ex-
amination of the district-level composite scores (Fig. 1) reveals that

and Odisha - have a wide range of performance at the district level,
with districts belonging to both the bottom as well as top 20 ranking
districts. This suggests substantial heterogeneity within a state that
should also be considered.
5. Sensitivity analyses
5.1. Health personnel changes who conduct VIA screening, LEEP and
colposcopy procedures
Sensitivity analyses were conducted to capture deviations from the
guidelines, whereby designated centres and personnel for screening
were changed due to limitations in infrastructure and resources. Certain
centres
(SHCs)
and
providers
(accredited
social
health
activists
(ASHAs), ANMs) were not equipped to roll out cervical cancer
screening, and only certain health providers (e.g., Ob/Gyn and medical
officers) were designated to conduct the LEEP and colposcopy proce-
dures, which changed ‘Potential Staffing’ scores. When we conducted a
sensitivity analysis to reflect this scenario, the overall average facility
readiness scores at the PHC level stayed the same (0.56) and slightly
reduced at the CHC (0.75 to 0.72), and SDH (0.84 to 0.83) levels. The
relative ranking of most states did not substantially change either.
6. Discussion
An evaluation of DLHS-4 data on facility readiness for cervical
cancer screening shows wide variation across states, domains and 4-
tiers of India's public health care system. Goa and Maharashtra were in
the top 5 composite score rankings for 3 out of 4 facility levels. Goa was
an early state to undergo the epidemiological transition towards a
dominant NCD burden, and as a smaller state, may be better equipped
to carry out early detection programmes for NCDs more effectively.
Maharashtra hosts the country's leading comprehensive cancer centre,
some of the oldest urban and rural population-based cancer registries
(Shastri et al., n.d.; Kaur and Suresh, 2013; The burden of cancers and
their variations across the states of India: the Global Burden of Disease
Study 1990–2016, 2018), and sites of randomized trials in cervical
cancer screening. While a few smaller states/union territories (< 1.5
million population size as of Census 2011) tended to have higher
composite scores (for eg. Sikkim, Chandigarh), medium-size (25–30
million population size) and larger states (90 million or greater) states
such as Punjab, and West Bengal respectively also fared well. Compo-
site scores tended to increase for higher facility levels of care though the
scores are not directly comparable since criteria for developing these
scores differed at each level (Appendix Tables 1–4).
Our analysis suggests that the biggest challenges to overcome in
India's public health facilities include gaps in ‘Infection Prevention’ and

‘Infrastructure’ at SHCs, and ‘Medicine and Laboratory Testing’ and
‘Potential staffing’ at PHCs. Specifically, autoclave availability was low
(27%) at SHCs, where most did not have an adequate mode of disposal
of infectious/biological waste (39% following ICMR guidelines). At
CHCs, only one fourth (24%) had the required antibiotics for treating
sexually transmitted infections (STI's). A potentially important barrier
for community uptake is a satisfactory, clean layout and space to con-
duct private cervical examinations, which was present in less than half
(45%) of SHCs. At PHCs, a major gap was lack of antibiotics for STIs
(14%) and only 23% had a ‘medical officer’ for referrals, management
and treatment of positive cases. Our assessment also suggests challenges
in effective linkages and referral pathways and monitoring and eva-
luation at PHCs; a telephone, computer and internet were only avail-
able for a third (34%) and a smaller proportion for data entry staff
(27%).
Lower scores at SHCs and PHCs - where the majority of cancer
screening at the population level is to be implemented - suggests a need
to focus on gaps at these facility levels for successful implementation of
the guidelines on oral, breast and cervical cancers. This was recognized
by the government's nodal training agency for cancer screening, the
National Institute for Cancer Prevention Research (NICPR), during
implementation; in recognition of these gaps, there was a reliance on
PHCs instead of SHCs for cervical cancer screening. Our sensitivity
analysis however, suggests similar results; there was a slight decrease in
scores for CHCs and SDHs when limiting the diagnostic and treatment
follow-up to specialists. In an effort to improve and learn as the
programme is rolled out, there are efforts to identify the performance of
health centres in rolling out screening for common NCDs using mobile-
based applications and research on dashboards to identify problem
hotspots (Pati et al., 2013). Since the time of the DLHS-4 survey, there
has been a nationwide increase to address the shortfall of health care
workers at the SHC and PHC levels in rural areas; from 2012 to 2018,
there was a 12.8% increase in female health workers and ANMs at the
SHC/PHC level, and a 2.8% increase in doctors at PHCs. This reduced
the shortfall from 10.3% in 2012 (Rural Health Statistics 2012, 2012) to
6.0% in 2018 (Rural Health Statistics 2018, 2018); other changes in
health infrastructure may have also improved over time, though data
are not yet available to analyze.
According to the operational guidelines of cancer screening released
by the Government of India (Government of India, 2016) women aged
30 years and older should undergo cervical cancer screening by VIA at
least once every 5 years by trained female health workers and auxiliary
nurse midwives at SHC's, and by trained staff nurses at PHC's, with
positive tests referred to the PHC/CHC/DH for further evaluation and
management by a trained ‘medical officer’ or gynecologist (Bagcchi,
2016; Government of India, 2016). We observed lower staffing scores at
PHCs than at SHCs, which is largely due to a low proportion with
‘medical officers’ (23%) and staff nurses, which are required for con-
firmation of positive VIA and to perform cryotherapy in eligible cases.
Screening implementation is further challenged by a decentralized
healthcare system with limited resources, state-driven health agendas
and inadequate financial coverage/protection (Chalkidou et al., 2014).

While health spending (Kaur and Suresh, 2013) may positively corre-
late with facility readiness scores in some states (e.g., Goa), the same
was not observed in others (e.g., Bihar which has higher spending but
lower scores), highlighting the challenges in pinpointing factors that
are driving the facility readiness scores.
There are important aspects of a successful screening programme for
cancer that are not captured in our findings. For example, ASHAs play a
crucial role in motivating eligible women in the community to come to
their screening site (SHCs), which is not captured by the DLHS-4. Future
surveys could capture these and other referral and diagnostic pathway
points and processes, which are necessary links and common problems
(Nicholson et al., 2018).
To ensure better uptake of screening at the SHC and PHC levels,
additional strategies could include raising public awareness on cancer
prevention and early detection, addressing fear and stigma and mon-
itoring knowledge levels – “pull”-related factors to increase demand for
services (Krishnan et al., 2015; Nyblade et al., 2017). The IDCCP toolkit
contains 13 categories for addressing facility readiness, of which we
evaluated 8 (6 for all levels and 2 additional categories for DHs) based
on available DLHS-4 data; other categories such as service utilization,
referral mechanisms and community sensitization, can address im-
portant gaps and be considered for inclusion in future DLHS surveys.
Moreover, the toolkit encompasses a broad range of cervical cancer
screening and control strategies, including the Pap smear, HPV testing
and vaccination, so it can be applied as cancer screening strategies and
recommendations
evolve
for
the
country
(Kaur
et
al.,
2017;
Sankaranarayanan et al., 2018). As India launches cervical, breast and
oral screening, this analysis can highlight gaps for states to focus their
efforts for successful implementation of cancer screening, and to set
performance standards going forward. Our study of the assessment of
quality of screening delivery provides critical information regarding the
facilitators and barriers to implement cancer screening; this informa-
tion is essential for strengthening cancer programs. Other aspects of
successfully launching a screening programme, such as monitoring and
evaluation (Sivaram et al., 2018) to measure aspects such as trained
personnel, meeting targets for screening and follow-up, supportive in-
frastructure as well as quality standards (Sivaram et al., 2018) can be
integrated into DLHS surveys.

7. Conclusion
Our findings suggest wide variation in facility readiness across the
country for cervical cancer screening as India prepares to implement
screening programme. In particularly, deficits in infrastructure and
staffing at the PHC-level may pose major barriers to the cervical cancer
screening flow as envisioned by the current guidelines. The top 5 states/
territories for each facility level included 2–3 smaller states or union
territories, as well the second most populous state, Maharashtra. The
IDCCP toolkit provides a method and measurement for assessing stan-
dards and performance across India's health care system as cervical
cancer screening is rolled out across the country, and over time for
adapting and improving screening implementation.

ABSTRACT
Introduction:
This
study
explored
interaction
processes
in
conveying messages about the results of diagnostic imaging investiga-
tions in a public hospital complex in South Africa from the perspec-
tive of health care providers and patients.
Methods: The study was part of a qualitative inquiry into the inter-
action and communication processes relating to diagnostic imaging
investigations in the public health care system. Data collection
included individual interviews with 24 patients and 62 health
care providers (ie, medical practitioners, specialists, radiologists,
registrars, radiographers, and nurses). In addition, 12 focus group
interviews were conducted with health care providers. The tran-
scribed data were coded and analysed to identify categories and
themes.
Results: Three main themes emerged from the study. The ﬁrst
theme deals with the medical territory, speciﬁcally who should inter-
pret and convey the diagnostic results to the patient. The second
theme highlights the role of radiographers and nurses in communi-
cating parts of the diagnostic results. The last theme focuses on
patient experience, interpretation, and comprehension in the
provider-patient communication process.
Conclusions: The ﬁndings provide a multidimensional view about
the disclosure of imaging results to patients by medical and nonmed-
ical health care providers. Further research is needed on the role of
nonmedical providers in the context of ethical and moral obligation
toward patients and the professional restrictions inherent in their
scope of practice.

Introduction
In the diagnostic imaging context, the written radiologic
report is the main medium of communication to patients
and medical practitioners [1–3]. However, Bazzocchi [3] con-
tends ‘‘that written communication cannot be considered suf-
ﬁcient
and
that
verbal
communication
will
become
increasingly central to the development of the modern radiol-
ogist’’ (p. 340). Equally important is the collective responsi-
bility of the radiologist and the referring clinician for the
eventual diagnosis [4]. The shift to shared responsibility for
communicating results so that ﬁndings are not lost ‘‘in ether’’
(p. 854) [4] is controversial [5] because of arguments related
to the organization of work and ethical, medicolegal, and
training implications [3, 6, 7]. Mathers et al [8] call for the
use of modern communication methods in a ‘‘multi-profes-
sional, multi-departmental approach to provide timely effec-
tive standardised and seamless results giving service for all’’
(p. 162). Similarly, Smith and Gunderman [9] pose the ques-
tion whether radiology department personnel (ie, radiologists,
nurses, radiographers, and administrative staff) should pro-
vide diagnostic imaging study results to patients or their fam-
ilies. Other scholars focus on the negative communication
impact of outsourcing communication responsibilities to
parties outside the medical profession, which could be a po-
tential source of error and misunderstanding [10].
The roles of radiographers, often referred to as radiologic
technologists [11], have signiﬁcantly changed and diversiﬁed
in response to advances in radiographic technology, skill
shortages, and changes in health systems. Generally, radiogra-
phers are not allowed to discuss the results of imaging inves-
tigations with patients, which often leads to added anxiety for
patients [8]. In contrast, nurses are allowed to disclose positive
results to patients on instruction by medical practitioners
when a clinical action is required, such as notifying the patient
to make a return consultation appointment [12]. Despite the
ideal placement of radiographers and nurses to communicate
and sometimes interpret the results of an investigation, the
issue of their respective competencies and skills to perform
these tasks still needs to be adequately addressed [8].
From a patient perspective, the timeliness for giving and
receiving results is important [3, 5, 7]. Of equal importance
are health professionals’ expectations of who should normally
communicate the results to the patient and what the patient’s
preference in terms of where, when, and by whom the results
should be conveyed. Studies by Mathers et al [8] and Pahade
et al [13] found that patients preferred to be immediately
informed of the diagnostic imaging examination results by
the radiologist instead of the referring clinician. However,
Berlin [14] cautions that the decision to immediately commu-
nicate results to the patient should be made on a case by case
basis.
Health professionals in the public health sector in South
Africa are also confronted with similar issues regarding who
should communicate what kind of diagnostic imaging results
to patients. A patient who presents at a public health care
facility will be referred to the radiology department for
necessary investigations. Upon completion of the diagnostic
imaging procedure, the radiologist is required to write a
radiologic report and return the ﬁndings to the referring
medical practitioner or specialist, who will then communi-
cate the results to the patient [15]. How long it takes for
each patient to receive the results from the medical provider
depends on the workload of the radiologist and access to the
picture archiving and communication system or a teleradiol-
ogy system.
The aim of our study was to explore the interaction pro-
cesses in conveying the results of diagnostic imaging investiga-
tions from a multiprovider and patient perspective in a public
hospital complex in South Africa, and to understand to what
extent this represents the ‘‘seamless results’’ proposed by
Mathers et al [8]. This study is one of the ﬁrst to focus not
only on one particular point of contact between the patient
and a health care provider, but also on the interactions and
communication in the natural setting between patients and
providers and between different providers in the continuum
of patient care that includes diagnostic imaging investigations,
from admission to discharge.
Methods
This study entailed a qualitative research inquiry using a
constructivist approach to explore processes and interactions
between multiple health care professionals and patients
referred for diagnostic imaging investigations in a multilevel
public health care setting that included a district and an aca-
demic hospital. Patients admitted to this hospital complex are
mainly from poorer communities. Most do not have medical
insurance or their insurance is depleted. Their ﬁrst language is
any one of the 11 ofﬁcial South African languages or a lan-
guage spoken in other southern, eastern, or central African
countries. Most have a basic ability to understand English.
Permission for conducting the study was obtained from
the Research Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Health Sci-
ences, University of Pretoria, Pretoria, South Africa. All par-
ticipants were ensured of conﬁdentiality and gave written
informed consent before being included.
The study consisted of two main phases. Phase 1 entailed
following (‘‘shadowing’’) a convenience sample of 24 patients
throughout their hospital encounter. Data collection activities
included the following:
 Semistructured individual patient interviews conducted
on three occasions: at the point of entry, after the imaging
investigation, and at the point of discharge from hospital
or admission for in-hospital treatment
 Observations of patient-provider and provider-provider
interactions at all points of contact by means of observa-
tion checklists with closed and open-ended items
 Collection of radiologic reports and review of medical
ﬁles
 Individual interviews with 62 health care providers
responsible for treating the patient participants (Table 1)
198
C.R. Makanjee et al./Journal of Medical Imaging and Radiation Sciences 46 (2015) 197-204
Because it was not predictable which patients would pre-
sent with what condition(s) or which patients would be
referred for a diagnostic imaging investigation(s), only willing
participants were enrolled when they reported to the casualty
department or outpatient department of the district hospital.
The shadowing of patients continued until data saturation
was reached.
For phase 2, 12 focus group interviews were conducted
with 53 purposefully selected health professionals from the
various health care provider categories (Table 1); some had
participated in phase 1, whereas others did not. Three focus
groups were conducted with medical practitioners and family
physicians (range: 2–6 per group), three with radiographers
(range: 4–6 per group), two with radiology consultants and
radiology registrars (residents) (4 in each group), and four
with nurses (range: 2–8 per group).
The transcribed interview and focus group data were
manually analysed using an inductive approach after repeated
readings of the transcripts; categories were coded and higher-
level themes identiﬁed [16]. Trustworthiness was enhanced by
means of an audit trail and triangulation of data collection
methods (ie, observations, individual interviews, and focus
groups) [16]. Two researchers ﬁrst performed independent
analysis of the data; thereafter, all three researchers contrib-
uted to the reﬁnement of themes and interpretations.
Findings
The ﬁndings of our study provide perspectives from med-
ical and nonmedical providers on the value of conveying the
results of diagnostic imaging investigations, and also focus on
patient perspectives. Three main themes emerged from the
study: (1) medical territory, speciﬁcally regarding who should
interpret and convey the diagnostic results message to the pa-
tient; (2) the role of radiographers and nurses in communi-
cating parts of the diagnostic results; and (3) patient
experience,
interpretation,
and
comprehension
in
the
provider-patient communication process.
The following analysis codes are used in this section to pre-
sent the authentic voices of the participants: FG ¼ focus
group, II ¼ individual interview, PI ¼ patient interview,
MP ¼ medical practitioner or family physician, RADL ¼
radiologist or a radiology registrar, RAD ¼ radiographer,
and NP ¼ nurse.
Theme 1: Medical TerritorydWho Should ‘‘Put the
Picture Together’’? Who Should Show the Pictures? Who
Should Break the Bad News?
A salient theme in the study was who should take the pri-
mary responsibility of conveying messages of imaging investi-
gation
results
to
patients.
Most
medical
practitioners
(including family physicians), radiographers, radiology regis-
trars, and radiology consultants expressed strong viewpoints
about the control of the ﬁnal diagnosisd‘‘The ﬁnal diagnosis,
I think that is the role of the clinician’’ (FGMP).
‘‘The referring clinician has to have a look at the ﬁlms as well
and I think it’s at that point that the patient should be shown
the images . At the end of the day, that is the doctor that is
going to be treating them, not us [radiologists]’’ (FGRADL).
In support of this view, medical practitioners further justi-
ﬁed the reason for insisting that they should communicate the
diagnosis instead of the radiologist by delineating the profes-
sional boundary of the radiologist as carrying out the imaging
investigation only.
‘‘We [medical practitioners] have the bigger picturedthe
blood results, the urine results. We can put the picture
together . not just isolating and treating just per investiga-
tion. We spend time with the patient. We have a patient rela-
tionship. So it’s not fair for the investigator [radiologist] to
explain the results’’ (FGMP).
One medical practitioner described the patient-interaction
role of the radiologist as being conﬁned to technological
interpretation-related matters ‘‘to get a better picture, better
view, [or] another, that is ﬁne . that small interaction’’
(FGMP). In addition, the medical practitioners indicated that
the radiologist should merely ‘‘ . have a discussion with the pa-
tient as to interpret the x-rays better . give [patients] the report
and [tell them] ‘Go back to your attending doctor’’’ (FGMP).
‘‘I can just imagine the radiologist scream, ‘You have got lung
cancer!’ Next one, ‘Sorry, my friend, you’ve got one big lump
in the breast’; next one, brain cancer. I do not want my sur-
geon to be the guy who wanted to read his psychiatry . I
won’t allow the bravest surgeon to cut out and take out the
problem, so I want that. That is why certain people are at-
tracted to certain things’’ (FGMP).
‘‘So let the family physician give him the bad news because he
is trained for that and let the radiologist give you the correct
diagnosis with the report on a central system’’ (FGMP).
The radiologists and radiology registrars were of the
opinion that it would be unfair and/or inappropriate to
make the communication of results their responsibility
because their radiologic ﬁndings may be inconclusive as a
result of the broad spectrum of possible diagnoses.
‘‘Having an inadequate history and inadequate request and
not having a doctor’s contact number, so to make that our
role to discuss what we saw on an x-ray to the patient is inap-
propriate. Because we don’t have all that information, and a
lot of the times what we see on an x-ray, we have to give a

differential diagnosis for, which ranges from general cancer to
a minor infection. So although it’s sometimes . of beneﬁt for
showing the x-rays to patients, I think it’s better that the refer-
ring clinician treating the patient be the one to discuss those
ﬁndings’’ (FGRADL).
‘‘Firstly, in terms of the history, often we don’t get a good his-
tory from the referring clinicians. Sometimes the history is not
appropriate or it doesn’t help us to come to a speciﬁc diag-
nosis. A lot of things are left out. Often biochemical results
are left out; things that we think are important. Sometimes
they don’t understand what we need and vice versa’’
(FGRADL).
Another reason for limiting the communication of diag-
nostic results to the referring medical practitioner was the ra-
diologists’ acknowledgement that they often do not have the
full picture of the interactions that had taken place before
the referral. As such, they were respectful of the doctor-
patient trust relationship.
‘‘It’s also difﬁcult because you don’t know what your referring
clinician has told the patient before they sent the patient to
you. So sometimes you prefer to have the referring clinician
read the report, you know, before you give the information
to the patient. Because it’s a very general source of problems
and conﬂict between the patients and the referring clinician’’
(FGRADL).
‘‘I think it might be unfair to make it ours, because we don’t
see the patient. We don’t have the continuity of care and we
can’t just give them the shocking news or something bad and
expect them just to go away and you know we can’t follow up
on that. It’s a bit of a grey area that still need a bit of atten-
tion’’ (FGRADL).
Despite the strong views expressed about the patient-
communication boundaries between medical practitioners
and radiologists, some clinicians at the district hospital actu-
ally expressed some ambivalence regarding the strict profes-
sional communication boundaries.
‘‘You see from our [medical practitioner] point of view, I
mean, if we tell the patient the results or the radiologist
does, it doesn’t really make a difference. That’s ﬁne, provided
we have the [radiological] report. I mean from the patient’s
point of view, it’s really poor that the radiologist can’t be
bothered to tell what’s wrong with him. I mean . . . they’re
doctors ﬁrst and radiologists second; that patient is their re-
sponsibility surely’’ (FGMP).
Theme 2: Everybody’s TerritorydWhen to Convey What
and to Whom?
Professional participants in this study had diverse views on
what could be communicated to patients by other health care
providers like radiographers and nurses. The medical pro-
viders and radiographers regarded the main communication
role of radiographers as preventing harm through judicious
interaction with patients and to avoid further harm when pa-
tients were unaware of their medical condition. Nurses
regarded their own communication role as explaining the
diagnostic results already shared by the referring clinician in
cases of patient confusion or uncertainty.
However, some medical practitioners were unsure what
radiographers were allowed to convey to patients.
‘‘If a patient has an ankle fracture, are [radiographers] allowed
to tell the patient, ‘You have a fracture’?’’ (FGMP).
Several practitioners were of the opinion that radiogra-
phers ‘‘work with it daily for many, many years, surely .
[they] immediately see the fracture’’ (FGMP).
Although radiographers had the required skill and expertise
to communicate certain conditions to patients, communica-
tion had to be done with due respect for professional
boundaries.
‘‘I think the function of the radiographer [after taking the x-
ray is to] just give a little bit information to the patient. ‘The
ﬁndings, we have done the x-rays, we ﬁnd 1-2-3 according to
your x-ray when we look at the picture. That 1-2-3 the doc-
tors must solve.’ It will be much better to the patient because
the doctor doesn’t explain anything to the patient about the x-
rays’’ (FGNP).
‘‘Usually if a patient comes in with a suspected fracture, I
don’t know because even the radiographers don’t say any-
thing. They just send back the patients. They might tell the
patient that the doctor will have a look and explain’’ (FGNP).
Generally, radiographers agreed that it was appropriate not
to cross professional boundaries because the communication
of diagnostic results did not fall within their scope of practice.
‘‘They ask me very often to show [the x-ray] but we are not
allowed to discuss with them. So I usually tell them the x-
rays will be on the system now for their doctor to see it and
then he will discuss it with them as soon as he sees it on
the computer’’ (IIRAD).
However, there was an ethical dilemma.
‘‘In some circumstances it’s good to tell them, but in other cir-
cumstances it’s not’’ (FGRAD).
As such, radiographers occasionally shared some diagnostic
information with the patient with the sole purpose of avoid-
ing further harm to the affected body part during the transi-
tion back to the referring clinician for further medical care.
‘‘I had one or two patients who were really distressed. [The
patients asked:] ‘Is my arm broken or isn’t it broken?’ And
then I actually took them to the monitor and showed
them the x-ray and asked them if they can see something.
They would say, ‘Is it broken there?’ Then I would say,
‘Yes, so be careful with your arm.’ . I think it helps the pa-
tient then to get some clarity . just to help him to know,
okay, my worst fears have been conﬁrmed; it is broken’’
(FGRAD).
Some radiographers expressed reluctance to communicate
with patients about imaging results because they had not
received adequate training in how to deal with patient
200
C.R. Makanjee et al./Journal of Medical Imaging and Radiation Sciences 46 (2015) 197-204
responses, even though they recognized the potential beneﬁt
of such information for the patient.
‘‘We [radiographers] don’t learn how they’re going to react
and how we’re going to react to how they react. So I think
that is one of the main reasons we shouldn’t be telling
them. But at the same time I really feel that the more patients
don’t know what’s going on, the more intimidated and afraid
they feel. But often if I see people that you say, it is broken,
the doctor will tell you further and you can immediately see
them accept the fact. So it is a bit of a difﬁcult situation’’
(FGRAD).
The dilemma between respecting and addressing patient
concerns and respecting medical practitioner professional
boundaries in which radiographers sometimes ﬁnd themselves
is aptly illustrated in the following case of a radiographer con-
ducting a ward chest radiographic investigation:
‘‘I didn’t really know what to do. I was in the paediatric ward
and it was a seven-year old boy . the mother helped me with
the child. Afterwards she looked at the x-rays as I was busy
annotating on the image. She asked me why his heart was
so big. I knew it was big, but I am not allowed to say because
it might be pathology and she had me in an awkward situation
because she can see there is something wrong. What should I
tell her now? So I just told her, ‘Yes, children’s hearts are
bigger than ours. You have to consult with your doctor. He
knows what he saw in your boy. He was there; he listened
to the heart and the lungs, so he knows better than I do. I
just took the picture. I have no history, so rather speak to
your doctor.’ She immediately knew maybe with my explana-
tion there might be something wrong but she understood after
I explained. She understood I can’t tell her anything more’’
(FGRAD).
Similar to radiographers, professional nurses were also
aware of their restricted role in disclosing the results of diag-
nostic imaging investigations. However, they were of the
opinion that they could ﬁll communication gaps between
medical practitioners and patients by explaining ﬁndings
and clarifying the content of radiologic reports in lay
language.
‘‘The doctors come here [to the ward]. They check on the ma-
chine and on that light [viewing box] and then they discuss
that among themselves; the x-ray and what they are going
to do . but the patient, they don’t know. They don’t go
to the patient and tell them that’’ (FGNP).
‘‘Patients do tend to ask questions, so there have been patients
who have come to me with their x-ray reports and asked me to
explain in Afrikaans or English what the doctor has written
there to interpret the report for them’’ (IINP).
However, nurses recognized the limitations of their role as
educators as a result of their limited knowledge and skills to
interpret radiographic images and radiological reports.
‘‘I think it will be good that they [the doctors] inform us and
train us what they see’’ (FGNP).
‘‘If we can be able to read the ﬁndings, we will be able to
explain the ﬁndings, from there explain to the patient that
they have done this. Usually most patients they are illiterate.
So then we need to tell them the photo that they took, they
found that there is a crack in your bone or . what they
took of your lungs, there is this cloudy appearance. We also
need to be knowledgeable about explaining the results, though
we know it’s the duty of the doctors because they are the ones
who diagnose’’ (FGNP).
Theme 3: Provider-patient CommunicationdWhat Does
the Patient Ultimately Experience, Know, and
Understand?
After a diagnostic imaging investigation, there is inevitably
some interaction between the referring clinician and the pa-
tient regarding the results of the investigation. In our study,
the interaction took place with and sometimes without images
being shown to the patient. In some instances in which more
than one medical practitioner was responsible for the patient,
each provider conveyed a diagnostic message based on his or
her own interpretation. In other instances, there was no clear
diagnosis communication between the medical practitioner
and patient as the patient moved to and fro between the im-
aging and referring departments. No patient participant re-
quested
to
see
any
radiologic
report
or
initiated
communication about their imaging results although some
participants expressed a desire for better communication of
imaging results in their exit interviews.
The inadequate communication skills of some medical
practitioners may have a signiﬁcantly negative effect on the
chain of explanation and communication with the patient
as well as on the patient’s perceptions and interpretations of
the diagnostic investigation results. The importance of appro-
priate communication skills when medical practitioners have
to share diagnostic information with patients regarding the
presence of a serious medical condition is illustrated in the
following case:
‘‘I went to the sonar department for an abdominal sonar. While
I was lying on the bed the one doctor was this side, the other
doctor was [that] side. They are doing the scan . and the doc-
tor said, ‘Oh, that’s cancer.’ I almost died on that table that
day. I mean, really, I almost had a heart attack. Just so blunt-
d‘It’s cancer’. I mean, that is not the way to do it. Even if it
was cancer, he should have discussed it . then come and tell
me in a proper way. I was so shocked that day’’ (FGNP).
The importance of clear, unambiguous, and mutually
consistent diagnostic messages is especially important in
cases in which more than one medical professional is
attending to the same patient. The importance of consistent
messages is illustrated in the case of a boy admitted to a ward
with a fractured femur. Conﬂicting diagnostic messages to
his mother by a medical ofﬁcer [X], an orthopaedic registrar
[Y], and a medical specialist [Z] resulted in signiﬁcant
confusion.
C.R. Makanjee et al./Journal of Medical Imaging and Radiation Sciences 46 (2015) 197-204
201
‘‘They told me two days ago my child’s bone is not growing.
The x-rays show it’s not growing at all, this doctor [medical
ofﬁcer X] has told me so. And now yesterday they told me,
no, but the bone is growing. Now how do you explain that?
The one day they tell you there is no differencedhe’s been
lying here for one monthdand the next day the doctor [regis-
trar Y] says the bone is all right; it is starting to grow . I
don’t know, because the other doctor [Y] knows; X only
came afterwards. So the other doctor [Y] who is higher than
X, I think she is a specialist; she is learning for orthopaedics.
Then he [specialist Z] told me they looked at the x-rays well
. then he [Z] told me the bone is busy growing, bone forma-
tion, but not quite as it should be 100%. So how did they see
it if that doctor X had said the bone is not growing? . I don’t
know what has happened there. Because the one doctor says
this and the other says that. So you are so confused. . My
head is so confused’’ (PI).
In summary, we observed in our study some cases in which
patients had not received any clear information from any
health care provider regarding the diagnostic results of their
x-ray investigations. Also, the patients in our study were
largely inactive communication participants and tended to
refrain from requesting clariﬁcations from the health care pro-
viders. One radiology registrar summarized the situation as
follows:
‘‘Actually in terms of x-rays or scans, our department is lack-
ing if that’s the perception of patients [to be informed on the
radiological results]. At the moment we just do the report and
we tell them, ‘Don’t worry, it’s on the system. The doctor will
check it up. So just go see the doctor.’ That means they don’t
know. They don’t see the report. They don’t see the x-rays.
They don’t see anything. It’s like a big secretdtake the x-
rays, put it into an envelope and you stick a letter on the [en-
velope]d‘Conﬁdential’, do not open or whatever. And they
think they’re not allowed to open it. Obviously then it’s
like they don’t know what’s in there. And they take it to
the doctor. And it’s stressful for them. So I think that is some-
where we’re lacking in the system; our system is like that’’
(FGRADL).
This is how a medical practitioner reported on the same
issue.
‘‘I have seen patients they have been through the whole sys-
tem. They come back and you ask them [what has happened].
‘Yes, they took x-rays. I had an accident. . They never told
me what was wrong with it.’ . ‘No, I don’t know [if I have a
fracture]. They never told me.’ So there is cases where it hap-
pens like that’’ (FGMP).
Discussion
The ﬁndings of this study provide insight into the commu-
nication processes regarding diagnostic imaging investigation
results from a multiprovider perspective and a patient
perspective. In this context, various ethical issues and contro-
versies need to be considered, especially those that might
result in conﬂict between radiologists and medical practi-
tioners, between medical providers in the same profession,
between radiographers and patients, and between nurses and
patients [17]. Although all the health care providers in this
study concurred that the communication of results was pri-
marily the responsibility of the medical practitioner [18],
nonmedical providers such as the nurses and radiographers
also articulated their unique roles and responsibilities related
to imparting the results of diagnostic imaging investigations.
The patients in our study were often curious about the
diagnostic results, but very few questioned the medical pro-
viders (medical practitioners, specialists, radiologists, and
radiology registrars) about their results, possibly because of
the diverse language proﬁle of the patients served by the hos-
pital complex where the study took place. Some patient par-
ticipants
would
have
liked
to
have
received
better
communication of imaging results but were unfamiliar
with the practice of requesting a radiologic report. Studies
from other countries reported on patients’ preference for
getting their results from the radiologist immediately after
the diagnostic imaging examinations [8, 18]. According to
Bazzocchi [3], this preference is linked to current trends of
patients being more aware and better informed about med-
ical issues than before. As such, this consumerist trend has
signiﬁcant implications for various levels of radiologic
training and practice in terms of work organization and legal
and ethical matters [3, 6].
The radiologists in our study were reluctant to accept the
responsibilities of direct patient communication because
conveying imaging investigation results had not been consid-
ered a part of their roles in the past [4]. This reluctance might
be linked to radiologists’ expressed need for formal training in
effective communication skills [1, 18], speciﬁcally with regard
to establishing an attentive relationship with a patient, sharing
clinical information, and treating patients with empathy and
respect within a framework of patient rights [19]. Further-
more, Ortega and Garci
a [1] hold that effective communica-
tion skills and attitudes in a health care context require
changing from a focus on the necessities of medical profes-
sionals to those centering on patient rights and needs. A
recent survey by the European Society of Radiology on pa-
tient communication, conﬁdentiality, and consent found
that routine practice varied across Europe [20], whereas the
Radiological Society of South Africa’s code of conduct states
that patients may directly request their imaging results or a
radiology report from the radiologist ‘‘unless there is a
compelling reason to believe that information contained in
the record will result in substantial harm to the patient or
others and/or the law prohibits disclosure’’ [21]. In the public
health care sector in South Africa, the radiologic report is not
routinely made available to the patient.
During general radiographic examinations and some that
are more specialized (eg, computed tomography), the patient
does not directly interact with the radiologist but only with
the nonmedical health care provider [3]. In these situations
the radiographers act cautiously in being truthful and
compassionate, with a focus on the safety of the patient
[22]. Nurses could play a signiﬁcant role in bridging the
202
C.R. Makanjee et al./Journal of Medical Imaging and Radiation Sciences 46 (2015) 197-204
communication gap between medical providers and patients,
which Ortega and Garci
a [1] refer to as the ‘‘humane’’ (p.
472) aspect of radiologic care. The common focus is the
best interest of the patient. However, communication of im-
aging results to the patient remains fragmented between
different health care providers, with no one provider having
an overview of what has been communicated in the various
health care service contexts. Our study found that evidence
of communication ‘‘seamlessness’’ [8] was very sparse, and
very few patients received adequate information at various
points of service care; more often patients were uncertain
or not informed at all.
This study was a ﬁrst attempt to investigate and describe
the multiprovider communication of diagnostic imaging re-
sults to patients in a South African public health care setting.
Because the study was conducted qualitatively with a small
number of participants in one hospital complex, no claims
are made about generalising the ﬁndings to other settings
although the ﬁndings may resonate with some readers and
could inform the design of similar studies in the private health
care sector or in other countries. A further limitation was the
unpredictability of the patient cases recruited through conve-
nience sampling, and who would be referred for a radiologic
opinion or not. This could have limited the scope of the
study, although data collection continued until data satura-
tion was reached and no new insights emerged. The fact
that patient participants did not request their radiologic re-
ports nor initiate communication about their imaging results
may have limited the researchers’ understanding of all the
possible patient reactions regarding the communication of re-
sults. With regard to process, communication, and interac-
tion, some health care providers may have done or said the
‘‘right’’ thing because of the presence of a researcher with
each patient. However, this potential limitation did provide
the opportunity for further exploration in the focus group
interviews.
To make further recommendations regarding optimal ways
of conveying radiologic results in South African public hospi-
tals, the following is needed in further studies: exploration of
existing protocols that may include references to the commu-
nication of results; analysis of the accuracy of information
provided to patients; further focus on patients’ engagement
with radiologic reports; inclusion of more health facilities
with a larger geographic spread, a broader spectrum of pa-
tients (eg, ward patients, not only day patients); and more
provider participants.
Further research is also justiﬁed on the role of nonmedical
providers, especially radiographers and nurses, in the context
of ethical and moral obligation toward patients and the pro-
fessional boundaries stipulated in their scopes of practice.
Feasibility studies to assess the impact on the medical
encounter where nurses and/or radiographers convey the mes-
sage of the outcomes could be conducted. Studies should not
only focus on the communication process and content but
also on the multiprovider health care system’s approach to
keep patients adequately informed during their journey
through the system, as well as on strategies to ensure patient
comprehension of their diagnostic imaging results in relation
to their condition. Lastly, our study suggests a need to design
and implement continuous professional development pro-
grams that focus on effective provider-patient communication
skills regarding diagnostic imaging results within the South
African public health care system.
Conclusion
The ﬁndings from this study provide a bird’s-eye view of
the disclosure of imaging results by medical- and nonmedical
health care providers, with the exception of clerks. All profes-
sional groups referred to the ideal of the referring clinician be-
ing the ‘‘carrier of the message,’’ but all alluded to the
challenges they had experienced in this regard. We found
some similarities with ﬁndings from other studies in terms
of nonmedical providers’ ability to communicate certain types
of information regarding imaging results. On the one hand,
the communication context raises several ethical dilemmas,
especially when nonmedical health care providers lack skills
and competencies to effectively communicate imaging results.
On the other hand, our study shows how nonmedical pro-
viders could play a positive role in beneﬁting the patient, espe-
cially when their actions are directly in the interest of the
patient.

Background: Robust pharmaceutical management information systems (PMIS) strengthen healthcare planning
and delivery. Few nationwide studies in resource limited settings in Africa validate the data quality of PMIS in
public healthcare.
Objective: To determine predictors and quality of data in a nationwide PMIS database in Namibia.
Methods: A population-level analysis of the quality of data i.e. completeness, accuracy and consistency in a
nationwide PMIS database, 2007–2015. Data quality of the PMIS was determined by three domains, com-
pleteness, accuracy and consistency. Data completeness was determined by level of missing data in SPSSv25,
with acceptable level set at < 5%. Data accuracy was determined by proportion of PMIS indicators with extreme
outliers. Data consistence was determined by patterns of missingness, i.e. random or systematic. Predictors of
data quality were determined using logistic regression modelling.
Results: A total of 544 entries and 12 indicators were registered in the PMIS at 38 public health facilities. All the
PMIS indicators had missing data and 50% (n = 6) had inaccurate data i.e. extreme values. The data for most
PMIS indicators (75%, n = 12) were consistent with the pattern of missing completely at random (MCAR, i.e.
missingness < 5%). Incompleteness of PMIS data was highest for average number of prescriptions 6%, annual
expenditure per capita for pharmaceuticals 5% and population per pharmacist's assistant 5%. The main pre-
dictors of poor quality of PMIS data were year of reporting of PMIS data (p = 0.035), level of health facility
(p < 0.001), vital reference materials available at the pharmacy (p = 0.002), and pharmacists' posts ﬁlled
(p = 0.013).
Conclusions: The data quality of PMIS in public health care in Namibia is sub-optimal and widely varies by
reporting period, level of health facility and region. The integration of data quality assurance systems is required
to strengthen quality of PMIS data to optimize quality of PMIS data in public health care.
Introduction
Globally, the impact of sub-optimal health care delivery attributable
to weak Health Management Information Systems (HMIS) is signiﬁcant,
particularly among countries in sub-Saharan Africa where there is a
high disease burden and limited resources.1 For instance, since the
implementation of the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) in 2005
that advocated for strengthening of health management systems, there
was limited progress on MDG targets in Sub-Saharan Africa.2–4 The
World Health Organization (WHO) found that 57% of 103 countries
met the global MDG targets for malaria and progress in 41 countries
could not be assessed due to missing data.5
High quality HMIS and PMIS data is needed to assess health care
services. Despite the need for quality data to inform public health in-
terventions,6 few countries have documented assessment of quality of
HMIS and PMIS data. Quality of data is assessed mainly on four attri-
butes - timeliness, completeness, validity and accuracy.7–10 Three an-
nual (Q4) PMIS feedback reports of the Ministry of Health and Social
Services (MoHSS) disseminated during the period under study reveal
that the MoHSS assessed PMIS reports with regards to timeliness and
completeness of the regional annual reports from the 13 regions.11–13
However, the reports do not show quality of data with regards to ac-
curacy and validity. Kihuba et al., 2014 in Kenya found only 14%
(n = 22) hospitals did a data quality audit in an entire year.14 A data
quality assessment done in Singapore on data of four years 2008–2012
however found that data was largely complete 97–98% and veriﬁable

Quality health and pharmaceutical surveillance systems enhance
health care delivery and outcomes.15,16 However, none of the African
countries met the MDG targets by 2015. Tumusiime et al. attributed the
non-attainment of MDGs in the sub-Saharan Africa region to weak
health information systems.17 Additionally, the attainment of MDG
goals in the sub-Saharan region, largely depended on access to essential
pharmaceuticals and services such as HIV medicines. Moreover, studies
in sub-Saharan Africa depict that most health managers hardly use
HMIS data, mainly due to concerns with the quality of data.18
Consequently, global eﬀorts have scaled up the use of PMIS in the
public health sector in sub-Saharan Africa. In 2007, the MoHSS of
Namibia implemented an electronic dispensing tool (EDT) to track HIV
medicine and supplies, Electronic Tuberculosis (ETB) Manager, a web/
desktop-based tool for reporting on medicines for drug resistant TB
patients and a PMIS for essential medicines.19 Nevertheless, quality
data in PMIS is critical for sustainable access to quality medicines.20
Despite the improvement in PMIS indicators during the past decade
in Namibia, health indicators and delivery remain sub-optimal.21–25
The sub-optimal health delivery indicators in Namibia are attributed to
limited resources and poor quality of HMIS and PMIS data. The PMIS
reports depict inconsistent reporting on PMIS indicators across regions
and health facilities since 2007.12,13,26 This impacts negatively on the
delivery of essential medicines and related services. In fact, the quality
of data aggregated at various levels, i.e. health facility (HF), health
district, region and national levels has not been systematically eval-
uated. A limited form of data quality review was done in selected health
facilities during annual support supervision visits conducted by the
MoHSS with the support of partners.27 Studies in the other African
countries have demonstrated the bias of inconsistent HMIS/PMIS data
on indicators and may misinform the planning and delivery of essential
medicines and related services in public health care. For example a
study done in Uganda reported that data quality issues limited the
ability of policy makers to address challenges of intermittent preventive
treatment in pregnancy.28 Managers may not use data for decision
making and or improvements if it is of low quality.29,30
Consequently, the study aimed to assess the quality of PMIS data
over the past eight years, in order to provide guidance on the level of
bias to account for during the interpretation of results from the data-
bases as well as mitigate processes that lead to errors.
Methods
Design and setting
A population-level study that used facility aggregated data to
quantitatively examine the quality i.e. completeness, accuracy and
consistence of PMIS indicators over an eight-year period 2007–2015
using a nationwide database. The study utilized aggregate data on 12
PMIS indicators collected every quarter at public health facilities in all
14 regions of Namibia.
Pharmaceutical management information system (PMIS) in Namibia
In 2007, Namibia implemented PMIS in 13 (now 14) regions, 38
district and public hospitals of Namibia. The PMIS aggregates 23 in-
dicators at three levels, national, geographical region and health facility
(HF). The 23 indicators are aggregated every quarter, to report on ra-
tional use of medicines and quality of care (6), human resource de-
velopment and workload (5), medicine ﬁnancing (3) as well as stock
management and item availability (9).31
At each health facility, PMIS data is collected manually by the
pharmacist/pharmacist assistant (PA) using standardized PMIS forms
and subsequently entered into an electronic database. Data from the
health facility in each district is aggregated by the hospital Pharmacist
into a district summary. PMIS data from clinics is aggregated under the
respective health centers or hospitals they report to. Consequently, the
Chief/Regional Pharmacist reviews, analyses and aggregates data from
districts within the region into a regional summary. The Division
Pharmaceutical Services in the MoHSS aggregates and analyses all the
PMIS data into a national database and provides feedback through a
quarterly PMIS report with recommendations.
Procedure
Data on 12 PMIS indicators and 7 covariates i.e. reporting period
(year/quarter), level of health facility, region, district, health facility
and catchment population per pharmacist/PA were retrospectively
abstracted
from
the
national
PMIS
database
at
the
Division
Pharmaceutical Services of the MoHSS.
The 12 PMIS indicators included ﬁve medicine use indicators i.e.
average number of medicines per outpatient prescription, percent of
medicines prescribed by generic name in outpatient prescription, per-
cent of outpatient prescriptions with an antibiotic, percent of vital re-
ference
materials
available
at
the
pharmacy
and
percent
of
Therapeutics Committee (TC) meetings held and minuted out of
planned; seven indicators on pharmaceutical workforce and patient/
health facility characteristics (Table 1). The data represented health
facilities from 34 health districts from the then 13 (now 14) regions of
Namibia.
Some indicators are reported quarterly HF14, HF20, semi-annually
HF3, HF11, HF12, HF13, and annually HF10, HF16, HF17, HF18, HF19
and HF21 (Table 1). The collection, entry, aggregation and quality as-
surance of PMIS data is guided by standard operating procedures
(SOPs) in the PMIS manual.31 The SOPs require that quality assurance
checks are performed at three stages of handling and reporting PMIS
data i.e. data collection, aggregation and reporting at all levels i.e.
district, region and national. In addition, the SOPs describe a set of
check lists and review teams to ensure that the quality of the PMIS data
is maintained. Data were exported to SPSS v25 for management using
explorative statistics.
Data analysis
The population consisted of quarterly PMIS indicators for each fa-
cility in the nationwide database. Data abstracted from the PMIS da-
tabase were exported to SPSS v25 software and preliminary exploratory
descriptive analysis performed for each variable/indicator to assess
errors in the dataset. The main outcome measure was an assessment of
three domains of quality of PMIS data i.e. completeness, accuracy and
consistence. First, the completeness of PMIS data was assessed using
multiple imputation methods missing value analysis in SPSS. The ac-
ceptable level of missing data by case, variable and value was set
at < 5% and for PMIS dataset at 80%32 Secondly, the accuracy of PMIS
data were determined by the percentage of variables and cases with
extreme values i.e. outliers.
Thirdly, the consistence of PMIS data were determined using mul-
tiple imputation methods to identify whether missingness in data was at
random or systematic. The consistency in PMIS data i.e. patterns of
missingness were categorized into three patterns, that is, missing
completely at random (MCAR), missing at random (MAR) and missing
not at random (MNAR). PMIS data was considered to be consistent or
high quality data if the missing data were < 5% by case, variable, and
values i.e. MCAR. Variables with MAR or MNAR were considered of low
quality and require multiple imputation before analysis of the in-
dicators is performed.
Lastly, the independent predictors of the quality of PMIS data were
determined using multivariate logistic regression to calculate the ad-
justed odds ratios (aOR) for poor quality data i.e. cases with incomplete
data and/or outliers. The level of signiﬁcance-alpha for all statistical
tests was set at 0.05.

Ethics
The study was approved by the Research and Ethics Review Boards
of the University of Namibia and the Ministry of Health and Social
services (26 February 2019). The need for written informed consent
was waived since the study used secondary aggregated data and did not
directly involve human subjects. In addition, the study used existing
PMIS data of the MoHSS and documents accessible in the public do-
main. Nevertheless, all extracts from the PMIS database were coded to
anonymize the facility name from which the data were obtained.
Results
A total of 544 entries/cases, 12 indicators and 7 covariates were
entered in the PMIS database over the 8-year period, 2007–2015. The
covariates included year of reporting, period (quarter) of reporting,
region, district, level of facility, health facility and catchment popula-
tion. Of the 38 health facilities included in the PMIS database, 92%
(n = 35) were hospitals compared to three primary health centers. The
period prevalence of most (58.3%, n = 7/12) PMIS indicators for the 8-
year review period were outside the acceptable thresholds except for
HF3, HF14, HF18 and HF19; while HF21 has no target (Table 1).
Quality of PMIS data: completeness and accuracy
The completeness and accuracy domains of data quality were re-
spectively assessed by proportion of case, indicators and values with
missing data and extreme outliers using multiple imputation analysis
methods missing value analysis in SPSS. In general, data were missing
in all study variables (indicators, n = 12), 13% cases (entries, n = 71/
544) and 3% values (n = 196/6,528) entered in the PMIS over the 8-
year period, 2007–2015.
Of the 12 PMIS indicators that had missing data, 75% (n = 9) had
data missing completely at random (MCAR, i.e. < 5% of data missing)
(Table 2, Fig. 1). The prevalence of missing data was highest (≥5%)
with HF17 (Population per PA), HF20 (Average number of prescriptions
received at the pharmacy/dispenser/day) and HF21 (Annual ex-
penditure per capita for pharmaceutical and clinical supplies) PMIS
indicators (Table 1).
In addition, six PMIS indicators (50%) had both incomplete
(missing) and inaccurate data (extreme outliers), these included HF3,
HF11, HF13, HF16, HF17 and HF20 (Table 1). The prevalence of in-
accurate data (extreme outliers) was highest with PMIS indicator HF16
and HF11 accounting for 42% (n = 66) of the 156 extreme outliers in
the PMIS database.
Patterns of missingness of PMIS data by reporting source and period
Multiple imputation methods in SPSS was used to determine whe-
ther PMIS data were missing at random or systematic. In general, data
in the PMIS database was missing completely at random (MCAR) for
75% of the variables (indicators) and 25% were missing at random
(MAR) (Fig. 1).
The level of missingness (% incomplete data) in PMIS data was
signiﬁcantly
higher
in
the
fourth
reporting
quarter
(Q4,
January–March) compared to the second (Q2, July–September) and
hospital versus health centers data (Table 2). The missingness varied
widely between region, year of reporting, pharmacist/PA staﬀcom-
pliment, and therapeutic committee (TC) meetings held with means
40%(range:0–100%), 54%(range: 25–92%), 35%(range:0–92%), and
39%(range:27–46%) respectively (Table 2, Fig. 2).
Factors associated with completeness and accuracy of PMIS data
Table 3 represents the proportions of cases (entries) with/without
missing data for each of the 12 PMIS indicators, and their association
time varying covariates, i.e. reporting periods (year/quarter) and data
source (region, district, health facility level).

In general, the mean scores of most PMIS indicators (83.3%, n = 10)
were signiﬁcantly diﬀerent between cases (entries) with and those
without missing data or outliers (p < 0.05), with the exception of
HF11 and HF13 (Table 3). The level of missingness was signiﬁcantly
associated with the reporting period, i.e. year [50%(n = 6)] for in-
dicators HF3, HF12, HF14, HF16, HF19 and HF20; and/or quarter
[50%(n = 6)] for indicators HF10, HF16–HF19 and HF20 and facility
level [41.7%(n = 5)] for indicators, HF16-17, HF20, HF21. The varia-
tion in source of PMIS data by district and region signiﬁcantly aﬀected
quality of data for 4(33.3%) of the indicators. The catchment popula-
tion and pharmacist establishment were not signiﬁcantly associated
with quality of PMIS data (Table 3).
The quality of PMIS data (i.e. missingness and outliers) was more
likely to vary across 6 covariates (i.e. year, quarter, region, district,
level, facility) with HF18 indicator 83.3%(n = 5/6), HF16 and HF17
66.7% (n = 4/6) and HF21 (50%) compared to HF3, HF10, HF14, HF19
and HF20. HF11 and HF13 were not inﬂuenced by time varying po-
pulation covariates (p > 0.05) (Table 3).
Multivariate model of predictors of quality of PMIS data
A multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify
independent predictors of quality of PMIS data for the 8-year period,
i.e. 2007–2015 using adjusted odd ratios (aOR) (Table 4). A test of the
full model against a constant only model was statistically signiﬁcant,
indicating that the predictors as a set reliably distinguished between
poor and good data quality (i.e. incompleteness, accuracy and con-
sistency) (χ2 = 228.6, DF = 1, p < 0.001). The Nagelkerke's R2 of 0.19
indicated a relationship between prediction and grouping by quality
(1 = poor quality, 0 = good quality). The overall prediction success of
the multivariate logistic model was 89.5% (99.2% for good quality, i.e.
no missing data/outliers and 10.3% for poor quality). The Wald cri-
terion demonstrated that increasing year of reporting of PMIS data
(p = 0.035), health center level of health facility, the decreasing access
to vital reference materials at the pharmacy, and percent increase in the
pharmacists' posts ﬁlled [aOR = 11.095%(CI: 4.8,25.4, p < 0.001)],
[aOR = 1.024 (95%CI:1.009,1.040, p = 0.002)] and [aOR = 0.984
(95%: 0.972,0.997, p = 0.013)] respectively signiﬁcantly contributed
to quality of PMIS data (Table 4). The poor quality PMIS data was
higher in 2014/2015 compared to preceding years i.e. 87%(2008/
2009),73%(2009/2010),76%(2010/2011),69%(2011/2012)
and
70(2012/2013 and 69%(2013/2014) less likely to occur compared to
2014/2015 (Table 4).
A preliminary crude logistic regression showed non-signiﬁcant
(p > 0.05) predictors of quality (i.e. completeness, accuracy and con-
sistence) of PMIS data, i.e. geographical region, district, population per
pharmacist, population per PA, annual expenditure per capita for
pharmaceutical and clinical supplies, average number of prescriptions
received at the pharmacy/dispenser/day and percent of TC meetings
held and minuted out of planned, and these covariates were excluded
from the ﬁnal model due a non-signiﬁcant cOR (p > 0.05).
Discussion
The study aimed to determine the quality of data in the PMIS in
public health care in Namibia, by three domains, completeness (missing

data), accuracy (extreme outliers) and consistence (patterns in miss-
ingness and extreme outliers), as well as the predictors of quality of
PMIS data.
The study found a high level of incomplete data (i.e. all indicators
had missing data) and extreme outliers (half of the indicators had ex-
tremely low and high values) in the PMIS data.
Poor quality data is a concern, as incomplete and/or inaccurate data
results in errors in estimation of medicine use indicators. This may
negatively impact on decisions regarding strategies that the MoHSS
may use to improve quality of pharmaceutical services in Namibia. Our
ﬁndings concur with other studies in developing countries such as
Uganda, Kenya, Pakistan, Rwanda, Tanzania, Malawi and Ethiopia
which have reported high levels of incompleteness and inaccuracy in
data in HMIS.32–39 A study done on District Health Information System
(DHIS) reporting in Uganda found missingness of outpatient reporting
as high as 63.7% and 14.7% before and after DHIS2 implementation
while missingness of inpatient reporting decreased from 79.4% to
42.1%, still showing gaps in accuracy of the data.40 Inadequate tech-
nical support supervision was among factors contributing to the less
than desirable completeness and timeliness of HMIS reporting. This
ﬁnding is similar to ours on gaps in HMIS/PMIS data and likely factors
aﬀecting the completeness of data at both hospital and health center
levels.
For instance, a study by Nisingizwe et al. in Rwanda showed the
level of missingness of 10 indicator data to range between 5% and 12%,
similar to the missingness we found in our study 13% of cases (n = 544)
and 3% of the values (n = 6,528) entered in the PMIS over the 8-year
period. Seventeen percent (17%) districts reported data outside the
HMIS national ratios,41 similar to our ﬁnding of extreme values in 50%
(n = 6) PMIS indicators. There is limited literature on extreme values/

outliers in HMIS data as many studies focus on completeness and
timeliness aspects of data quality.
Studies done in developed countries where electronic PMIS are
implemented also show levels of data missingness and inaccuracy for
example a study conducted in Boston reﬂected a 56.8% inaccuracy of
medication as per records.42 Missingness or inaccuracy in doses, fre-
quencies and drug commission or omission was also identiﬁed in a
study done in Florida.43 These gaps end up in PMIS and aﬀect datasets
that are used to generate information for decision making. This calls for
eﬀorts for quality checks at all levels and throughout the process of
collection, aggregation and reporting on PMIS indicators.
Moreover, the study found that indicators pertaining to medicine
use (i.e. HF11 and HF13) and pharmacy workforce (i.e. HF16 and
HF17) had the lowest quality, i.e. incompleteness and accuracy. This is
a concern as it parallels the poor indicators with increased antibiotic
use in Namibia and developing countries that is an important risk factor
for development of antimicrobial resistance leading to poor health
outcomes. A study in Namibia also indicated poor reliability and va-
lidity of medicine use indicators in estimating the appropriate use of
medicines.44 Indeed, this calls for interventions to account for missing
data during aggregation and reporting at various levels.
The study also found that prevalence of poor quality data (in-
complete or inaccurate) was higher in the fourth quarter, at health
center level, facilities without a complete pharmacy staﬀestablishment
(i.e. Pharmacist/PA) and not having platforms for TC meetings. This is
despite MoHSS eﬀorts towards strengthening pharmaceutical services
in Namibia, such as the introduction of the PMIS in 2007 to monitor
pharmaceutical services, training of health care workers on PMIS, an-
nual supportive supervision and mentoring of health care workers on
PMIS.45 A study done in Tanzania found that training and supervision
did not improve quality of HMIS data.46 Given the noted quality of data
despite the interventions implemented in Namibia, it is important for
the MoHSS to review the strategies such as training, supportive su-
pervision and mentoring and how these were or are conducted in order

to enhance their eﬀect on pharmaceutical services and PMIS perfor-
mance. The resources used in trainings and those existing for training
also need to be reviewed to ensure alignment and consistence in
guiding health care workers on PMIS implementation and quality re-
porting.
In addition, in 2009 nationwide implementation of therapeutics
committees (TCs) as structures for accountability and oversight on
medicines use were implemented. In 2012, the MoHSS developed and
started using a PMIS manual.31 The PMIS manual emphasizes the role
of TCs in PMIS data analysis at district and regional levels.
The WHO recognizes sustainability of programs in most developing
countries as a major challenge. In particular, the PMIS in Namibia were
largely supported by Donor funding and technical assistance through
USAID-funded projects such as Systems for Improved Access to
Pharmaceuticals and Services (SIAPS, 2011–2018], Strengthening
Pharmaceutical Systems (SPS, 2007–2011), Rational Pharmaceutical
Management Plus (RPM plus) and Supply Chain Management System
(SCMS, 2006–2016).
Never the less, although majority of the data were missing com-
pletely at random (MCAR), the occurrence of extreme outliers sig-
niﬁcantly skews the analysis and reporting of PMIS indicators. An in-
tegrated point of care PMIS should thus be implemented with checks
incorporated to reject entry of outliers. For example, the system should
be able to ﬂag the pharmacist or PA of entry of extreme values. This will
minimize errors and improve quality of the data. A study done in
Botswana recommends regular data quality checks to strengthen na-
tional health information systems like PMIS.47 Practicing quality as-
surance at all levels from data collection to dissemination can reduce
missingness and improve quality of data. However, the practice of data
quality assurance is still very limited in many countries. For example, a
study done in Uganda found less than 25% of health centers practiced
quality assurance measures during the process of HMIS data collection,
management through to dissemination of information for use.33
Several factors impact on HMIS/PMIS data quality. In our study,
inadequate pharmacy personnel (pharmacist and PAs) in health facil-
ities and possibly supervision at the health center level contributed to
PMIS data missingness. This is similar to a ﬁnding in a study done in
Pakistan that found 38% reports from 34 health facilities had errors and
attributed the gap partially to inadequate staﬃng and poor super-
vision.48 A study done at Morton Plant Hospital in Clearwater, Florida43
found that pharmacy technicians had less medication history errors
than nurses, implying that the pharmacy personnel are needed on
medication aspects and PMIS records in health facilities. This ﬁnding is
similar to our study where missingness varies by the number of
pharmacy personnel posts ﬁlled at the health facility, the same cadre
primarily responsible for PMIS.
The study concludes that quality of PMIS data in Namibia is com-
promised by high levels of incompleteness (i.e. missing data) and ex-
treme outliers. This negatively impacts on planning and equitable ac-
cess to quality, safe and eﬃcacious essential medicines and related
services as outlined in the National Medicines Policy. Quality PMIS data
are needed to accurately estimate medicine use indicators such as
average number of medicines per outpatient prescription and antibiotic
prescribing; pharmaceutical workforce and expenditure and plan for
appropriate interventions as key to provision of quality pharmaceutical
services in public health care. Poor quality data is not reliable to ac-
curately estimate pharmaceutical expenditure and consequently use
such evidence to advocate for resources from the government.
Inaccurate data on pharmaceutical workforce cannot be relied on as
evidence for advocating for appropriate pharmacy personnel, ﬁlling
vacant posts in the health facility establishment, revising number of
posts included in MoHSS structures and ensuring that pharmacists/PAs
handle just the right number of prescriptions per day for quality care.
The study recommends for a system to frequently audit the quality
of data in the PMIS, implement quality checks during the collection,
aggregation and reporting on indicators. In addition, a sustainable
framework for ensuring a quality and functional PMIS should be sup-
ported by the MoHSS, these may include task shifting and managerial
interventions to improve quality of HMIS/PMIS data at the facility
level. In addition, the MoHSS should introduce a built-in quality check
module in PMIS for ensuring automated reporting and timely action.
We also recognize that donor funds to support interventions have since
dwindled and support to the facilities has ﬂuctuated. This calls for in-
novative mechanisms to ensure sustainability of PMIS, particularly the
migration from paper based to electronic PMIS decision support sys-
tems that require minimum human input that introduces error.
The ﬁndings from this study should be interpreted with limitations,
particularly this study was based on population level data aggregated in
the PMIS and the study could not associate any patient level data with
the quality of data in the PMIS. Nevertheless, to our knowledge this is
the ﬁrst study in Sub-Saharan African region that has studied the
quality of PMIS data, indicators of which have been linked to misuse of
medicines and rise in antibiotic resistance. In addition, the study pro-
vides guidance on handling of PMIS data that is incomplete and in-
accurate.

THE NATURE OF QUALITY APPRAISAL IN SYSTEMATIC
LITERATURE REVIEWS OF HEALTH STATE UTILITY VALUES
(HSUVS): A RAPID EVIDENCE REVIEW
Muchadeyi M, Hernandez-Villafuerte K, Schlander M
German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, BW, Germany
Objectives: Quality appraisal (QA) of primary studies of HSUVs is a highly
relevant process to evaluate the certainty of the HSUVs estimated in the liter-
ature and summarised in the systematic literature reviews (SLRs). However, only
a few SLRs authors appraise the quality of contributing HSUVs studies. This
review aims to elucidate the nature of QA in SRLs of HSUVs and list the QA
items used. Methods: A rapid review was conducted in PubMed from 01.01.2015 to
15.05.2021. SLRs of empirical HSUVs studies published in English were included.
We extracted and reviewed descriptive data, including QA items and methods of
incorporating QA results into study ﬁndings. Additionally, QA tools, checklists, and
good practice recommendations (GPRs) used or cited were extracted. Frequencies
of use and occurrence of QA items, acceptance and counterfactual acceptance rates
(CAR) were computed. A list of QA dimensions and items used was generated.
Results: 68 SLRs were included, comprising 84 items. 38 out of the 68 SLRs ana-
lysed appraised the quality of individual studies (prevalence = 56%). A considerable
number of the SLRs (42%) used the recommendations from NICE and ISPOR as
guidelines. Response rates, loss of follow-up and sample size were evaluated the
most, used in 26, 21 and 20 SLRs, respectively. Acceptance rates were 100% in two
studies and 53% and 33% in two other SLRs that used QA to inform the data analysis.
The mean CAR was 55% (median 53% and IQR 56%). Conclusions: The prevalence of
QA in the SLRs of HSUVs appears low. Also, the QA dimensions and items included
in both SLRs and extracted tools vary widely. The most attributable reason for these
ﬁndings is the current lack of a widely accepted QA tool for primary studies of
HSUVs. This underscores the need to systematically develop a QA that has the
potential to be widely accepted.

Gueye A,1 Lemasson H,2 Gaudin AF,2 Baklouti M2
1Université de Paris-Dauphine, Paris, France, 2Bristol-Myers Squibb SARL, Rueil
Malmaison, France
Objectives: Cost-utility analysis (CUAs) are used to inform Health Technology
Assessment. In these CUAs, quality-adjusted life years are calculated based on util-
ities. The objective was to describe the use of quality-of-life (QoL) data in French
efﬁciency opinions (EOs) and to identify CEESP reservations relating to this use.
Methods: A systematic literature review of QoL data used in French EOs for ICIs and
CAR-T cell therapies from 2015 to 2022 was performed. In each EO, data sources,
valuation methods and CEESP reservations regarding QoL data use were reviewed.
Results: 36 EOs were included. The main source of utilities were clinical trials (97%;
n=35), including open-label trials in 74% (n=26/35) of EOs. Open-label trials informed
treatment-related utilities in 19% (n=5/26) of EOs. EQ-5D was widely (89%; n=32) used
for valuation. Three (8%) EOs used a non-French value set. A repeated measurement
mixed model was used in 25% (n=9) of EOs. Same health states utilities were assigned
to all comparators in 53% (n=19) of EOs. Utilities were adjusted for age in 11% (n=4) of
EOs. Disutilities are included for 86% (n=31) of EOs and based on literature (exclusively
non-French) in 58% (n=18/31) of EOs. Disutilities for adverse events were considered in
all 31 EOs and disutilities for administration in 13% (n=4/31). Some other methodo-
logical information, such as questionnaire completion rates, were underreported. QoL
was among the 5 most sensitive parameters in 54% of deterministic sensitivity analyses.
Proportion of CEESP questions regarding this topic increased from 4% to 15% between
2015 and 2021. Methodological reservations regarding QoL was mentioned in 67%
(n=24) of EOs with 1 major reservation in 2021. Conclusions: While QoL valuation
methods are becoming an important challenge, this study highlights heterogeneity in
QoL data use in French EOs. Speciﬁc French guidelines sustained by an increasing in-
dustrial/CEESP experience could help harmonize approaches and limit CEESP reser-
vations.

Company, Bethesda, MS, USA, 3Necker-Enfants Malades Hospital, Paris, France
Objectives: CF-IQ, a 23-item patient-reported outcome instrument assessing the life
impacts of CF, was recently validated in people with CF aged $18 years. This study
aimed to qualitatively evaluate the content validity of the CF-IQ in adolescents (aged
12-17 years) with CF. Methods: Non-interventional, cross-sectional, qualitative in-
terviews were conducted with adolescents with CF in the US, recruited through a CF
caregiver panel using stratiﬁed purposive sampling to ensure representation of all
adolescent age groups. Cognitive debrieﬁng techniques were used to assess appro-
priateness and interpretability of the CF-IQ instrument, its domains, and speciﬁc
items. Interviews focused on three main aspects: item content (items/instructions
clearly understood), response options (response options clearly understood), and
item relevance (items aligned with patient experience). For item revision to be
considered, $5 independent reports of item content or response option issues were
required. If $5 unique participants identiﬁed item content or response options is-
sues, item relevance was considered for item or response option revision.
Results: Participants (N=20) had a mean age of 13.9 years and a self-reported mean
percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second of 100.7. Most participants
(n=17; 85%) were on CF transmembrane conductance regulator modulators. Younger
participants (aged 12-13 years) accounted for the majority of comprehension issues
related to item content (75%) and response option (61%). Participants aged 12-13 and
14-15 years reported more items as irrelevant in their experience than those aged
16-17 years. No item within CF-IQ had $5 unique participants reporting item content
or response option comprehension issues. Conclusions: No modiﬁcations are
needed to the CF-IQ items; although item relevance differs by age, the scoring al-
gorithm is robust to these differences and may be used without reﬁnements. The CF-
IQ is relevant, interpretable, reliable, and valid within people with CF aged $12 years,
supporting its use in future clinical trials and research studies.

USE OF THE PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES
MEASUREMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM (PROMIS) IN
RARE DISEASE CLINICAL TRIALS
Poritz J, Wiltshire L, Hubscher E
Cytel, Waltham, MA, USA
Objectives: A 2017 ISPOR Emerging Good Practices report acknowledged challenges
in selecting patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures for rare disease clinical trials.
To address these challenges, the use of item banks or computer adaptive tests (CATs),
such as the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS),
was suggested. Our objective was to explore the ways in which rare disease clinical
trials have utilized PROMIS measures to assess quality of life (QoL) in studies pub-
lished since 2017. Methods: PubMed was searched using the terms ‘patient-reported
outcomes measurement information system,’ ‘PROMIS,’ and ‘clinical trial” from 2017
to present. Rare disease clinical trials that included PROMIS measures as an outcome
were identiﬁed and examined. A search of www.clinicaltrials.gov was also conducted
to locate additional published studies. Results: We identiﬁed 39 articles published
since 2017 that reported on the use of PROMIS measures across 33 rare disease
clinical trials. In 26 trials, PROMIS short forms or proﬁles were used. Of the seven
trials that utilized PROMIS item banks, four administered CATs, and three used the
item banks to create custom short forms speciﬁc to the patient population. A com-
parison of trials that began before and after the release of the 2017 report showed
only a small increase in the use of item banks through the administration of CATs.
Conclusions: PROMIS measures have been used in rare disease clinical trials in
several different ways, including item banks/CATs. Although the use of item banks
through the administration of CATs reduces patient burden and contributes to more
sensitive measurement of QoL, the impact of the 2017 ISPOR report recommendation
was not evident in recent rare disease clinical trials. Over time, increased usage of
PROMIS item banks will enhance our understanding of QoL among patients with rare
diseases and allow for comparisons across patient populations.

Objectives: The progressive explosion of non-communicable diseases (NCD) and mul-
timorbidity has challenged health systems in Chile and worldwide. The Centro de
Innovación en Salud ANCORA UC implemented a new Multimorbidity Patient-Centered
Care Model (MPCM) between 2017 and 2020. It was aimed to reorganize health services
based on diagnosis towards new care focused on the person’s needs with multimorbidity
stratiﬁed according to their risk. The study aimed to evaluate the implementation of core
elements of MPCM in its pilot phase in Chile from the perspective of high-risk patients.
Methods: We conducted a survey study that considered the application of a 13 items-
telephone questionnaire. Of them, ten were Likert scale types with scores from 1 to 7,
and the last three were open-ended questions. 231 high-risk patients who received care
through MPCM at primary care centers participated in the study. Data were encoded,
consolidated, and analyzed with the SPSS software. We performed descriptive and
analytic statistics techniques to asses different variables and their potential associations.
Results: The overall score was 5.84 (range: 1 to 7), with a SD of 1.25. Questions with the
best scores reﬂected the personalized care and the primary care team. The lowest was
the one regarding the continuity of care between primary nurses and inpatient care at

the hospital. There was a difference in patient outcomes depending on their health
center. Regarding sociodemographic characteristics, age did not signiﬁcantly affect the
results. Conclusions: The study reveals the perceptions of a complex multimorbidity
intervention from the patient’s perspective. It complements the impact on health
services utilization evaluation that supports decision-makers currently scaling up a
similar strategy in our country and could be taken from other countries dealing with
NCD.

Objectives: To develop targeted educational tools based on the results of an
online survey in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
Methods: This project had two phases: (1) to gather patients’ insights and
educational needs, an online qualitative survey was completed by 305 patients in 4
countries (Austria, Canada, Romania, Spain) between Oct-Nov 2020, and (2)
development of educational tools for assisting healthcare professionals based on
patients’ reports. Results: In total, 80 patients from Romania participated in this
project. Main patient characteristics: 46 (58%) males, 59 (74%) retired, 50 (63%) over
60 years old. Exacerbation insights: Half of COPD patients never heard of the term
‘exacerbations’, but were familiar with ‘worsening/ﬂare-ups’, which were associ-
ated with disease progression and negative emotions. They did not differentiate
exacerbations by severity, and most could not recognize or self-treat an exacer-
bation. Most patients had little information on COPD and were concerned by the
need to be hospitalized during an exacerbation and require oxygen therapy during
disease evolution. A few patients were aware of means to prevent exacerbations
(quit smoking, avoid exertion/polluted environments). Four proﬁles emerged: the
optimistic (good support system, educated and informed, good adherence, in
control of COPD); the resigned (lower educational level, no knowledge on disease,
low adherence, ignores the disease); the overwhelmed (poor support system,
informed, advanced stage, overwhelmed by disease/social stigma, low trust in
treatment/physicians); the laid back (young, early stage, active, good support
system, informed, conﬁdent). Educational tools derived: a visual aid based on COPD
outcomes (disease map) to help educate and engage patients in their disease
management and an exacerbation lexicon including the real-life stories of patients
participating in the survey. Conclusions: Recognition of exacerbation and prompt
action seem challenging for COPD patients. Educational tools based on their needs
may be useful in improving disease management.

Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany
Objectives: Cancer and cancer care often cause additional costs for patients and
their families. Existing instruments addressing the socioeconomic impact of
cancer vary in their dimensions. Further, various terminologies have been used in
the literature (e.g., ﬁnancial burden, ﬁnancial hardship, ﬁnancial stress) without
clear deﬁnitions and consistent conceptual background. Based on a systematic
review of models addressing the socioeconomic impact of cancer, our goal was to
develop a suitable framework for use in European populations. Methods: A ‘best-
ﬁt’ framework synthesis was applied. First, we systematically identiﬁed existing
models to generate an a priori framework. Second, we systematically identiﬁed
relevant European qualitative studies and coded their results against the a priori
framework. Thematic analysis and team discussions were applied in these two
steps to ﬁnalize the (sub-)themes included in the ﬁnal framework. Third, the
model structure and quotes from qualitative studies were revisited to explore
relationships between (sub-)themes to form the ﬁnal conceptual framework. This
process was repeated until no further change in (sub-)themes and their relation-
ships emerged. Results: Eighteen studies containing conceptual models and seven
qualitative studies were included. Eight themes and 20 sub-themes were identiﬁed
in the a priori framework. After the coding process of the included qualitative
studies against the a priori framework and team discussions, seven themes and 15
sub-themes were included in the ﬁnal framework. Based on the identiﬁed re-
lationships, we categorised themes into four groups: causes, intermediate conse-
quences, outcomes and risk factors. These groups and their associations formed
the conceptual framework for socioeconomic impact research in the European
context. Conclusions: We propose a ‘socioeconomic impact framework’ based on a
systematic review and synthesis of existing models in the ﬁeld and adapted to the
European context. Our proposal will form an integral part of a European consensus
proposal by an Organisation European Cancer Institute Taskforce on socioeco-
nomic impact research.

Objectives: To evaluate burden associated with chronic inducible urticaria (CIndU)
vs. psoriasis (PSO) and atopic dermatitis (AD) in the EU5. Methods: Data from adults
with a physician diagnosis of CIndU, PSO and AD were collected from the 2020
National Health and Wellness Survey. Outcomes included SF-12v2 (Mental [MCS]
and Physical Component [PCS] Summary scores), health utility scores (SF-6D, EQ-5D-
5L), EQ-5D visual analogue scale (VAS), health resource utilization (HRU) in past 6
months, and Work Productivity and Activity Impairment scores (WPAI). Multivari-
able analyses were used to compare outcomes; results are presented as adjusted
mean/percentage (standard error [SE]) for each comparison. Results: Among 62,319
respondents, 199 had CIndU, 2,636 had PSO, and 788 had AD. Mean (SD) age at data
collection was 42.4 (16.3), 50.9 (15.6), 44.6 (15.8) years; female 65.8%, 54.2%, 67.4%
for CIndU, PSO and AD, respectively. Patients with CIndU reported signiﬁcantly worse
health outcomes compared to PSO and AD (PCS: 45.8 [0.6] vs 48.3 [0.2] vs 49.1 [0.3];
SF-6D: 0.63 [0.009] vs 0.68 [0.002] vs 0.68 [0.005]; EQ-5D: 0.67 [0.015] vs 0.76
[0.004] vs 0.78 [0.008]; EQ-5D VAS: 63.8 [1.6] vs 68.5 [0.5] vs AD 67.9 [0.9]; p,0.05
for all). MCS scores in CIndU were lower than PSO and comparable to AD (42.4 [0.7]
vs 44.0 [0.2]; p,0.024 and 43.5 [0.4]; p=0.149). HRUs were higher in CIndU
compared to PSO and AD (for any HCP visits: 96.2% [1.1] vs 93.0% [0.6]; p=0.030 vs
94.4% [0.9]; p=0.200; ER visits: 28.7% [3.4] vs 16.7% [0.8] vs 13.7% [1.3]; hospital-
isations: 28.5% [3.4] vs 9.4% [0.6] vs 6.8% [0.9]; p,0.0001 for all). CIndU reported
signiﬁcantly higher (worse) WPAI scores compared to PSO and AD (p,0.001).
Conclusions: After adjusting for confounders patients with CIndU have worse health
outcomes, higher HRU and work and activity impairment compared to PSO and AD.

QUALITY OF LIFE AND PRODUCTIVITY LOSSES OF
DYSMENORRHEA PATIENTS IN KOREA
Yoon H, Suh HS
Kyung Hee University, Seoul, Korea, Republic of (South)
Objectives: Dysmenorrhea is a common symptom in women. Dysmenorrhea impairs
patients’ quality of life and causes productivity loss in patients. However, there is a
limited study on the disease burden of dysmenorrhea. This study was conducted to
measure health-related quality of life and productivity loss of dysmenorrhea patients
in Korea. Methods: Secondary analysis with the data of a multicenter, randomized
controlled trial evaluating efﬁcacy, safety, and economic effect of Dangguijagyak-san
on primary dysmenorrhea patients was performed. 16-40 years old women who had
primary dysmenorrhea for three consecutive months with at least 50 VAS scores
were included in the trial. We descriptively analyzed the health-related quality of life
and productivity loss of the patients. Subgroup analysis was conducted by ﬁve-year
age groups. EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D), Verbal multidimensional scoring system (VMSS),
Retrospective symptom scale (RSS), and Short form McGill pain questionnaire (SF-
MPQ) were used to measure patients’ quality of life. iMTA productivity cost ques-
tionnaire (iPCQ) was used to estimate patients’ productivity loss due to dysmenor-
rhea. Results: A total of 240 dysmenorrhea patients were included in the analysis.
The mean EQ-5D score was 0.5702. The average VMSS grade was 2 (“daily activity is
affected; analgesics required and give sufﬁcient relief so that absence from school is
unusual; moderate pain”). RSS results showed during one menstruation cycle, pa-
tients slept 4.24 hours more than usual because of dysmenorrhea, and 57.5% of total
patients took an average of 3.52 analgesics to relieve pain. The mean productivity
loss due to absenteeism, presenteeism, and unpaid work was $11.40, $151.53, and
$58.91, respectively. Total productivity loss due to dysmenorrhea was $ 221.85 per
month. Conclusions: This study provides an overview of dysmenorrhea women’s
health-related quality of life in Korea by presenting measurement results of various
health-related quality of life instruments. Also, this study provides information on
productivity loss due to dysmenorrhea in Korean patients.

A B S T R A C T   
From the mid-1990s several countries have introduced elements of the model of regulated competition in 
healthcare. In 2012 we assessed the extent to which in five countries ten important preconditions for achieving 
efficiency and affordability in competitive healthcare markets were fulfilled. In this paper we assess to what 
extent the fulfilment of these preconditions has changed ten years later. 
In 2022, as in 2012, in none of the five countries all preconditions are completely fulfilled. In the period 
2012–2022 on balance there have been some improvements in the fulfillment of the preconditions, although to a 
different extent in the five countries. The only preconditions that were improved in most countries were ‘con­
sumer information and transparency’ and ‘cross-subsidies without incentives for risk selection’. On balance the 
Netherlands and Switzerland made most progress in the number of better fulfilled preconditions. For Belgium 
these preconditions no longer seem relevant because the idea of regulated competition has been completely 
abandoned. In Germany, Israel and Switzerland, the preconditions ‘effective competition policy’ and ‘contest­
ability of the markets’ are not sufficiently fulfilled in 2022, just as in 2012. In Germany and Switzerland this also 
holds for the precondition ‘freedom to contract and integrate’. Overall, the progress towards realizing the pre­
conditions has been limited.   
1. Introduction 
In the last decades of the 20th century there was much discussion 
about competition versus regulation in healthcare. In many countries 
reforms were implemented or proposed to make the healthcare system 
more competitive (see e.g. [1–3]). In this paper we focus on five coun­
tries with a social health insurance system that from the mid-1990s have 
introduced elements of the model of regulated competition in health­
care: Belgium, Germany, Israel, the Netherlands and Switzerland. Peo­
ple in these countries were given a periodic choice among risk-bearing 
social health insurers (sometimes called sickness funds). The rationale of 
competition among the insurers is to improve efficiency in healthcare 
production and to increase responsiveness to consumer preferences, 
while the rationale of regulating competition is to guarantee affordability 
and counteract market failure (see e.g., [4]). Although competition 
among healthcare providers was not explicitly aimed for in all five 
countries, it has either been stimulated or seriously discussed and pro­
posed. Therefore, in an earlier paper [5] we indicated the extent to 
which ten important preconditions for achieving efficiency and afford­
ability in competitive healthcare markets - i.e., competition both in the 
health insurance market and the healthcare provision market - were 
fulfilled in these countries in 2012. We found that the extent to which 
these preconditions were fulfilled varied substantially across the five 
countries, but that in all countries some important preconditions were 
not fulfilled. This paper aims to assess the situation in the same countries 
ten years later: to what extent are these preconditions fulfilled in 2022?

The relevance of this paper is that policymakers in these five coun­
tries know what the priorities are in terms of the necessary preconditions 
to be realized if they want a competitive healthcare system to result in 
both efficiency and affordability. The experiences in these five countries 
may also be worthwhile for other countries (considering) implementing 
regulated competition in healthcare. 
2. Ten preconditions 
The theory behind the model of regulated competition in healthcare 
was developed and elaborated by Enthoven [1,6–8]. From his theoret­
ical model we derived ten important preconditions for achieving effi­
ciency and affordability in competitive healthcare markets. The specific 
interpretation and definitions of efficiency and affordability may vary 
across countries because this also depends on the prevailing norms and 
values in society [5]. For example, Henriquez et al. [9] formulated 
similar preconditions for countries with a combination of a strong public 
single payer and voluntary private health insurances, such as Australia, 
Chile, Ireland, South Africa, and New Zealand. 
The preconditions, which are specified in Table 1, relate to the reg­
ulatory regime and institutional/structural aspects of the healthcare 
system including the incentives for consumers, insurers and providers of 
care. In short, the rationale of the preconditions is as follows. The pre­
conditions ‘contestable markets’ and ‘effective competition regulation’ 
are essential preconditions for achieving and maintaining a competitive 
healthcare market, which is assumed to improve efficiency. ‘Transparent 
consumer information’ is necessary because without transparent infor­
mation on the quality of care, price competition may reduce the quality 
of care. The preconditions ‘risk-bearing buyers and sellers’, ‘freedom to 
contract’ and ‘effective quality supervision’ are essential to let a 
competitive market improve the quality and efficiency of care. ‘Cross- 
subsidies’ between income and risk groups are necessary for achieving 
affordability and ideally there should be no incentives for risk selection 
[10]. For a further discussion of the rationale for each of the pre­
conditions, we refer to our earlier paper [5]. 
The goal of this paper is to assess to what extent these preconditions 
are fulfilled in 2022. We do not evaluate the actual effects of these 
preconditions on consumer, insurer and provider behavior because such 
behavioral effects are difficult to assess, but we focus on the assessment 
of the preconditions. Whether in practice efficiency and affordability 
have been achieved, is an empirical question that is beyond the aim of 
this paper. The same holds for the question whether regulated compe­
tition is the best model (for these countries) to achieve efficiency and 
affordability. 
3. Preconditions fulfilled in 2012? 
Table 1 summarizes the subjective assessments by the authors of the 
extent to which the preconditions were fulfilled in Belgium, Germany, 
Israel, the Netherlands and Switzerland in 2012. For Germany we do not 
consider the about 10 percent of the population with a private health 
insurance. Each author rated each precondition with a score ranging 
from 0 (‘not fulfilled at all’) to 10 (‘completely fulfilled’) for each of the 
countries. 
A major finding was that in 2012 in none of the five countries all 
preconditions were completely fulfilled and that there was a substantial 
difference across the countries in the extent to which the preconditions 
were fulfilled (see Table 1). The preconditions ‘free consumer choice of 
insurer’, ‘cross-subsidies without opportunities for free riders’ and 
‘guaranteed access to basic care’ were (nearly) largely fulfilled in all five 
countries. With one exception (Belgium) the same holds for the 
precondition ‘risk-bearing buyers and sellers.’ The precondition ‘effec­
tive quality supervision’ was largely fulfilled in all countries except 
Switzerland. In all countries insurers were confronted with substantial 
incentives for risk selection (in particular in Israel and Switzerland) and 
in all countries there was not sufficient transparent consumer informa­
tion about the quality of care. The precondition ‘freedom to contract and 
integrate’ was hardly/moderately fulfilled in Belgium, Germany and 
Switzerland, and the preconditions ‘contestable markets’ and ‘effective 
competition regulation’ were not fulfilled at all in Belgium, Israel, and 
Switzerland, and only moderately in Germany.

4. Preconditions fulfilled in 2022? 
To prevent overlap with our earlier paper, this paper primarily de­
scribes the major changes during the period 2012–2022 in the extent to 
which the preconditions are fulfilled in the five countries. Table 2 
summarizes the results, which will be discussed below. We disregard 
temporary measures directly related to COVID-19. For a detailed 
description of the 2012-situation we refer to our earlier paper [5]. 
4.1. Precondition 1. Free consumer choice of insurer 
4.1.1. No refusal or exclusions 
In all five countries the extent to which this precondition is fulfilled is 
very high, as in 2012. 
4.1.2. Sufficient choice options without a choice overload 
The extent to which this precondition is fulfilled in Belgium, Ger­
many, the Netherlands and Switzerland has not been changed (see 
Table 2). In Israel the four social health insurers have been differenti­
ating themselves more from each other by providing some non-essential 
extras, but consumers still have a choice among only four insurers. 
4.1.3. The ease of switching 
In Belgium the ease of switching in 2022 is very high, as in 2012. 
From 2020, in Germany the minimum contract period has been 
reduced from 18 months to 12 months and the transaction costs of 
switching in social health insurance have been reduced by the intro­
duction of a disenrollment service (which already existed in Belgium, 
Israel and the Netherlands). Before 2020 the new insurer produced a 
certificate informing that the insured had chosen this insurer, which the 
insured had to submit to the previous insurer. Now the new insurer in­
forms the previous one via the electronic communication system among 
insurers about the switch. 
In Israel the main transaction costs of switching insurer consist of 
switching family physicians. With the addition of dental care and mental 
health services to the benefits package, switching to another insurer may 
have become less feasible during treatments because of the relatively 
long treating time. Just as in 2012, it is hard for consumers to compare 
the lists of contracted providers. Switching has been made easier 
because since 2018 switching applications can also be submitted via the 
internet, while previously the only option was to submit a form to a Post 
Authority branch that informs the old and new insurers. 
In the Netherlands various changes had an ambiguous effect on the 
ease of switching. On the one hand the switching costs reduced because 
in 2015 insurers agreed that in the case of switching the new insurer will 
accept all pre-authorizations given by the previous insurer and they 
agreed to accept each applicant for a supplementary insurance at their 
standard premium if the applicant previously had a comparable sup­
plementary insurance [11]. In addition, from 2023 insurers are no 
longer allowed to give a group discount on the premium for the basic 
health insurance, which increases the transparency of the market. On 
the other hand, the market share of ‘products with a limited panel of 
contracted providers’ increased from 2 % in 2012 [12] to 22 % in 2022 
[13], resulting in higher switching costs, because it requires additional 
effort from the consumers to find the list of the contracted providers and 
the reimbursement for non-contracted care and it may require people to 
give up their regular provider when switching. 
On the one hand the switching costs in Switzerland have been 
reduced since 2012 because the market for insurance brokers has been 
strictly regulated. Acquiring new applicants by phone calls is now illegal 
and there are quality regulations for brokers. By banning unqualified 
brokers, the information for switching insured becomes more reliable. 
On the other hand, because of the increased number of insured with a 
managed care insurance product, switching insurer in 2022 is more 
restricted than in 2012 by the fact that this implies switching family 
physician. 
4.1.4. Impact of supplementary insurance 
The extent to which supplementary insurance is a switching barrier 
for basic health insurance, has not substantially changed in Belgium, 
Germany, and Switzerland (see Table 2). 
In Israel the waiting period imposed by the supplementary insurance 
and the long treatment time of the services covered by supplementary 
insurance (sold by the social health insurers) restrict switching for the 
basic insurance, because the social health insurers compete primarily on 
the supplementary insurance. The main use of this supplementary

insurance, which covers extras such as choice of surgeon, second 
opinion, and a private room in the hospital, is to shorten waiting times to 
specialists and procedures. The number of people owing a supplemen­
tary insurance offered by their social health insurer increased from 80 % 
in 2010 to 90 % in 2020. 
In the Netherlands, as described above, the switching barrier caused 
by supplementary insurances has been substantially reduced since 2015. 
4.2. Precondition 2. consumer information and market transparency 
4.2.1. Insurance products 
In Belgium and Switzerland, the level of consumer information and 
transparency concerning health insurance products (basic and supple­
mentary insurances) did not change (see Table 2). 
In Germany the out-of-pocket premium of social health insurance is 
in 2022 less transparent for the insured than it was in 2012, because in 
2015, by a change in legislation, the nominal out-of-pocket additional 
premium that the consumer paid directly to the insurer has been 
replaced by an income-related additional premium collected by the 
employer, which is less transparent for the consumer than a flat-rate 
nominal out-of-pocket premium. In addition, through lowering the 
level of subsidies that the social insurers receive from the central health 
fund, since 2015 almost all social insurers charge an additional nominal 
premium, whereas before only about 20 % of the insurers did so. 
In Israel the consumer information on social and supplementary 
health insurance has substantially increased since 2012. As the Israeli 
social health insurers are ‘managed care organizations’, information on 
their insurance products naturally contains information on their medical 
services. In 2013, the Ministry of Health launched a national program to 
evaluate the quality of inpatient care by hospitals and launched a site 
named "Call Health" [14], where information on eligibility, patients’ 
rights, and additional information on all aspects of the provision of care 
is available. Since 2014, a national program that evaluates about 40 
measures of the quality of care in the community, publishes comparative 
information for each health insurer. However, both programs provide 
too general information (e.g., the quality of care per health insurer but 
not per region, and the quality of care in a hospital and not in specific 
wards) which is not so useful to consumers. In 2017, the Insurance 
Authority launched a site named "Insurance Mountain" [15] where 
consumers can check their health insurance products and can find in­
formation on insurers. Several consumers’ sites (e.g., "Kamaze Health" 
[16]) provide comparative information on the social health insurers and 
their supplementary insurances. 
In the Netherlands transparency of social health insurance products 
has increased because since 2017 insurers must reimburse the full costs 
of non-contracted providers if consumers opt for a more expensive 
policy with in-cash reimbursement (instead of in-kind provision) [17]. 
In addition, the government-sponsored website ‘zorginzicht’ (previously 
‘kiesbeter’) [18] provides much more information than 10 years before. 
Furthermore, the Dutch Healthcare Authority (NZa) has become more 
active in regulating and monitoring consumer information provided by 
insurers [19]. Nevertheless, it is not always easy for the consumer to find 
and compare the lists of contracted providers and the reimbursement for 
non-contracted providers. As pointed out by an evaluation of 8 com­
parison websites [20] in 2021, 93 % of the Dutch population knows 
about their existence and 58 % is reasonably or very confident that they 
have enough information to make informed health insurance choices 
[21]. 
4.2.2. Medical services 
In the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium (Flanders) there has been a 
structured effort in the last decade to collect information about the 
quality of care offered in hospitals. This information is made available 
through a website [22], and the quality of this information is relevant, 
reliable, easily understandable, and transparent. Indicators directly 
related to the quality of care are most often adjusted for the case-mix of 
the hospital. However, this website is not very user-friendly and not 
known by the population. In the French-speaking part of Belgium 
(Wallonia) there is, as in 2012, no public information on medical ser­
vices. Although insurers publish hospitals’ prices on their website [23], 
in general Belgian consumers are still poorly informed about the (sup­
plemental) prices of doctors and hospitals. 
In Germany the precondition ‘consumer information and trans­
parency regarding the medical services and their providers’ is moder­
ately fulfilled in 2022, as in 2012. Until 2024, it was forbidden for the 
German social insurers to search within the data of their insured to 
identify any not yet treated disease or a health risk. Due to a new law 
(the “Gesundheitsdatennutzungsgesetz”, February 2024) they are 
allowed to do so and to use this information for managing care, and they 
may also inform the insured about their insights. (In the other 4 coun­
tries there is no law that forbids the insurers to use their ‘private’ in­
formation for managing care.) 
In Israel consumer information and transparency on the quality of 
care has substantially increased since 2012 (see the previous subsec­
tion). Furthermore, in contrast to 2012, social health insurers publish 
information on their websites about the prices and copayments for ser­
vices covered by supplementary insurance. 
In the Netherlands information on the quality of care has improved 
and became better accessible, particularly in case of hospitals. Most of 
the available relevant information about the quality of various treat­
ments, waiting times, patient valuations, and satisfaction rates for 
almost all Dutch hospitals are accessible at a single independent website 
‘zorginzicht’ [18]. This website also provides links to reliable informa­
tion about diseases, treatment options and medication as well as links to 
the websites with comparative information about provider quality and 
characteristics, and choice assistance tools [24]. Except for hospital 
standardized mortality rates, however, quality indicators are not 
case-mix adjusted. In addition, there are quite some missing data. There 
is also a private organization (Independer.nl) offering comparative in­
formation about the quality of care of healthcare providers [25]. How­
ever, reliable comparable quality information on other healthcare 
providers than hospitals is still largely absent. All healthcare providers 
are legally obliged to make their prices clearly visible to their patients 
[26]. 
In Switzerland information has substantially increased with respect 
to (age-gender-disease-)standardized mortality and complications for 
different hospitals. The Federal Office of Public Health has published 
these data [27]. One can compare all important hospitals with respect to 
all common diseases and sub-categories. The information is quite 
comprehensive and easy to find. For outpatient care there is, as in 2012, 
no reliable information. Furthermore, public information about the 
prices of medical services is still lacking. 
4.3. Precondition 3. Risk-bearing buyers and sellers 
In all five countries consumers receive subsidies to make health in­
surance affordable. The extent to which the ‘net-premium not covered 
by the subsidy’ reflects the costs of an insurer (or insurance product) is in 
2022 in all countries the same as in 2012. The same holds for the 
mandatory out-of-pocket expenses for the basic health insurance (for 
details, see [5]). 
In Belgium the government has decreed by law of 30 May 2022 to 
give up the whole system of individual financial responsibility for health 
insurers and to replace this by collective responsibility. De facto the 
financial risk of the health insurers in Belgium for the basic health in­
surance has been reduced from about 8 % in 2012 to 0 % in 2022. In 
Germany the social insurers’ financial risk has been somewhat reduced 
because since 2021 a retrospective high-cost pool has been imple­
mented: 80 % of costs above a threshold of 100,000 € per person per year 
are financed out of that pool. In Israel, the level of financial risk of the 
social health insurers for the expenses of the basic health insurance is in 
2022 high, as in 2012. In the Netherlands the financial risk of insurers

Health policy 146 (2024) 105099

has been increased for hospital expenses, from 92 % in 2012 to 100 % in 
2022. For mental healthcare, the financial risk for insurers increased 
from close to zero in 2012 to almost 100 % in 2022, except an ex-post 
compensation of 90 percent of the expenses above a threshold amount 
[28]). In Switzerland, since 2016 the government has become finan­
cially responsible in case an insurer goes bankrupt. However, since 
almost all insolvency problems are solved by a merger with a compet­
itor, the impact of the new regulation is probably minimal. 
Except for Germany and Switzerland, the financial risk of the hos­
pitals and freestanding providers of care remained the same as in 2012 (see 
[5]). In Germany, since 2020, the prospective payment per admission 
does no longer include the salary costs of nurses working on the wards. 
Instead, the actual costs of these salaries must retrospectively be paid by 
the insurers. In Switzerland hospitals are subsidized for about 55 % of 
their costs in 2022, while in 2012 this subsidy was about 50 %. Hence, in 
both countries the financial risk for hospitals have been reduced. 
4.4. Precondition 4. Contestable markets 
In all five countries the contestability (i.e., the extent to which there 
are no unnecessary barriers to enter or exit the market) of the market for 
basic health insurance is in 2022 the same as in 2012 (see Table 2). The 
relatively high contestability of the Dutch health insurance market can 
be illustrated by the entrance of two new insurers in 2018 and 2019, of 
which one decided to leave the market after 3 years. 
In Belgium, Germany, and Switzerland the contestability of the 
market for hospital services is low, as in 2012. In Israel the government 
regulates the number of beds (certificate of need) and the hospitals’ 
prices. The number of public hospital beds per capita continued to 
decrease and reached 1.8 beds per 1000 population in 2021, far below 
the OECD average. Consequently, waiting times to operations and im­
aging in the public hospitals have increased dramatically, and many 
patients turned to the private sector, where care is financed by the 
supplementary insurance. The shortage of public beds has led to the 
establishment of new private for-profit hospitals performing mainly 
surgical procedures. These hospitals received the required certificate of 
need from the government. This is an indication that the entry to the 
market for hospitals performing surgical procedures in Israel is quite 
contestable in 2022. However, for general hospitals that provide ser­
vices such as internal medicine, emergency care and intensive care, 
government has set distorted below-cost prices which discourages the 
entry of new hospitals. In the Netherlands the contestability of the 
market for hospital services has increased since 2012.The guaranteed 
compensation of hospitals’ capital costs has been gradually phased out, 
and since 2017 hospitals are fully at risk for covering these costs. The 
government maintained its position that it would no longer financially 
support failing hospitals and emphasized that it is the legal duty of 
health insurers to ensure care delivery, also in case of providers going 
bankrupt. By the end of 2018 two general hospitals went bankrupt and 
did not receive state support. Several other hospitals that got into 
financial trouble were taken over by other hospitals and often had to 
downsize the scale and scope of their activities. 
In all five countries the contestability of the markets for freestanding 
providers has remained the same (see Table 2). 
4.5. Precondition 5. Freedom to contract and integrate 
In all five countries the freedom to contract and integrate did not 
substantially change (see Table 2). 
Hospitals and sickness funds in Germany can conclude quality con­
tracts with each other for a limited period, with since 2017 as new el­
ements that (1) the Federal Joint Committee (‘Gemeinsamer 
Bundesausschuss’), a regulatory agency, was mandated to specify the 
scope of such contracts, and that (2) these contracts are now registered 
at the national level. The aim is to test whether the quality of inpatient 
treatment services can be further improved by means of incentive 
systems for compliance with special quality requirements. Just as before 
2017, sickness funds cannot deny the ‘standard’ contracts with hospitals 
if hospitals are not willing to engage in quality contracts. 
4.6. Precondition 6. Effective competition regulation 
In all five countries the competition regulation with respect to the 
market for basic health insurance, the market for hospital services and 
the markets for freestanding services is in 2022 largely the same as in 
2012, with some minor exceptions (see Table 2). 
For selective contracting by insurers Germany uses since 2016 the 
option of the EU Directive 2014/24/EU that for social services the 
member states can regulate that no tendering processes are necessary. 
This implies a lower impact of competition regulation on the market for 
integrated care. 
In Belgium the number of hospital networks is growing, but a new 
law has explicitly excluded these networks from the a priori concentra­
tion control by the Belgian Competition Authority. In the Netherlands in 
2015 for the first time a proposed hospital merger has been prohibited 
[29]. According to the ‘Authority for Consumers and Markets’ (ACM), 
the Dutch competition authority, the merging hospitals were strong 
competitors of each other and had a high joint market share. Never­
theless, the Dutch hospital market has become highly concentrated. 
Health insurers increasingly complain about contracting problems due 
to hospital market power and there is growing empirical evidence that 
hospital mergers result in higher contract prices without improvement 
in quality [30,31]. This spurred the ACM to issue a statement that it will 
take a more critical stance towards hospital mergers [32]. However, in 
2022 the government decided to eliminate the temporary lowering of 
the revenue threshold above which healthcare providers must notify a 
merger to ACM. Although ACM advised against this decision because it 
would reduce consumer protection against market power [33], the new 
thresholds went into effect in 2023. Consequently, almost all mergers 
between freestanding provider organizations can no longer be pro­
hibited by ACM. 
4.7. Precondition 7. Cross-subsidies without incentives for risk selection 
4.7.1. Presence and type of cross-subsidies 
In Belgium the out-of-pocket payments still put a heavy burden on 
patients. Co-payments are common and households pay 18 % of health 
spending out-of-pocket, which is slightly higher than the average EU 
share of 16 %. Relatively high unmet needs are reported by low-income 
people for medical care and dental care, mainly for financial reasons 
[34]. Therefore, the compensation for copayments has become more 
generous for the lowest incomes. 
In Germany the nominal additional premium has been replaced in 
2015 by an income-related additional premium. Some explicit cross- 
regional subsidies from insured in low-cost regions to those living in 
high-cost regions have been added to the risk adjustment formula in 
2020. Also, the level of subsidies from the central health fund has been 
(risk neutrally) lowered. In 2022 the income-related additional pre­
miums per insurer range from 0.4 % to 1.7 % of the income of the 
insured. 
In Israel, since 2012 the waiting times for operations and imaging in 
the public hospitals have increased dramatically, and many patients 
turned to the private sector, where care is financed by the supplemen­
tary insurances (with high copayment). The social health insurers offer 
supplementary insurances with age-rated premiums and accept all their 
members without exclusion of preexisting medical conditions, but they 
are only entitled to receiving benefits after a waiting period. 
In the Netherlands and Switzerland [35] the cross-subsidies in 2022 
are high, as in 2012. 
4.7.2. Incentives for risk selection 
In Belgium the financial incentives for risk selection have been 
W.P.M.M. van de Ven et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
Health policy 146 (2024) 105099

removed by reducing the financial risk for individual social health in­
surers in basic health insurance from about 8 % in 2012 to 0 % in 2022. 
Consequently, any profit from risk selection for the basic health insur­
ance is zero. 
In Germany, since 2021 the risk equalization contains health ad­
justers based on all diseases, as the limitation to 80 diseases has been 
abolished. In addition, region has been added as a new risk adjuster, 
which reduces the incentives for regional risk selection. Also, through 
the implementation of the retrospective high-cost pool, there is less 
undercompensation for high-risk consumers. Nevertheless, there are 
indications that chronically ill people on average are still 
undercompensated. 
In Israel the risk equalization formula has not substantially been 
improved since 2012. Recent findings [36] indicate that the health in­
surers make large predictable losses on certain groups, e.g., a loss of 30 
% on diabetic patients, up to 80 % on oncological patients, and 65 % on 
insured receiving disability allowance from Social Security. The main 
negative selection effects are the distortions of the competition among 
the insurers on the availability and quality of care. For example, the 
availability of family physicians in locations with many old, unhealthy, 
or poor people is lower than that in locations with many young, healthy, 
or rich people, and the health insurers invest and promote the quality of 
services consumed by healthy populations (such as "pregnancy pack­
age") [37]. 
In the Netherlands the risk equalization formula has been substan­
tially improved since 2012, e.g., by adding multi-prior-years’ high costs 
as a new risk adjuster in 2012, the extension of the inpatient-based 
Diagnosis-based Cost Groups (DCGs) with outpatient-based DCGs in 
2013, Medical Devices Cost Groups as a new risk adjuster in 2014, and 
the implementation of multi-prior-years’ low costs as a new risk adjuster 
in 2018. Nevertheless, for the 25 % of the population with the worst 
perceived health, health insurers suffer a predictable loss of more than 
500 euros per person per year [38]. The Dutch Healthcare Authority 
notes that the signals about risk selection are increasing [39] and is 
worried that risk selection reduces the solidarity on the social health 
insurance market [13]. The Dutch government has decided to use the 
constrained regression method [40] for estimating the risk equalization 
formula for 2024. This is a major improvement because on average 
chronically ill people, according to one definition of ‘chronically ill’, are 
then no longer undercompensated. 
In Switzerland the risk equalization formula has been improved since 
2012. In 2022 the Swiss risk equalization formula includes age, gender, 
canton, prior hospitalization (as in 2012), and Pharmaceutical Cost 
Groups (PCGs). These changes had a measurable impact on the market 
and substantially reduced the advantage of risk selection strategies used 
by conglomerates of insurance companies, which were established with 
the aim to make selection profits. In the period 2012–2023 the number 
of conglomerates reduced from 10 to 4, and the market share of all 
conglomerates reduced from 75 to below 30 percent [41]. Despite the 
improvements of the risk equalization formula, there are still substantial 
incentives for risk selection. For example, people in the top 1 
%-percentile (resp. 10 %-percentile) of the healthcare expenses in the 
prior year are undercompensated by CHF 26,710 (resp. CHF 5′610) [42]. 
4.8. Precondition 8. Cross-subsidies without opportunities for free riding 
People can be designated as free-riders if they do not buy mandatory 
basic health insurance (i.e., being uninsured) or do not pay the premium 
(i.e., a defaulter). 
In Belgium in principle there should be no uninsured legal Belgian 
residents. In practice, according to official statistics, at least 1 % of the 
population is uninsured and therefore lacks coverage. This share has 
been stable over the last decade. People are officially labeled as "de­
faulters" when they do not pay contributions for two years. The social 
health insurers are actively looking for solutions if individual problems 
occur. Defaulters receive care of comparable quality as non-defaulters, 
but will have to pay themselves the full treatment costs. 
In Germany the number of persons without health insurance in 2022 
is, according to official survey data [43], 0.13% of the legal residents, 
similar as in 2012. However, the real number might be much higher. As 
the additional premium is since 2015 collected by the employer or the 
social pension insurance, the opportunity of defaulting no longer exist. 
In Israel the health tax is collected as a direct tax by Social Security, 
so free riding is nearly nonexistent (as in 2012). 
In the Netherlands since 2012 uninsured persons are traced via the 
merging of several databases. The Central Administration Office (CAK) 
sends them a letter and imposes a fine (equal to three times the average 
premium) if the person does not buy health insurance after three 
months; and, if necessary, a second fine (again three times the average 
premium) six months after the notification. After nine months, the CAK 
ex-officio enrolls the previously uninsured person as an insured with an 
insurer (chosen by the CAK) for a year and imposes an administrative 
premium (equal to the average premium). This premium is collected as 
much as possible by withholding it at the source of income (e.g., the 
wage or social security benefits). Insured people who have not paid their 
premium for more than 6 months (and are then officially labeled as 
“defaulters”) must pay 120 % of the average premium to the CAK. The 
number of uninsured people has decreased from 58,000 in 2012 to 
24,000 (0.13 % of the population) in 2022 [44]. The number of de­
faulters has decreased from 304,000 in 2012 to 170,000 (0.96 % of the 
population) in 2022 [45]. 
In Switzerland about 160,000 individuals (1,9 % of the population) 
refused to pay their premium [46]. If an insured does not pay the pre­
mium or copayment, the insurer can, after at least one warning, demand 
the payment within 30 days. If the insured still refuses to pay, (s)he will 
face an enforced debt collection. A defaulter is not entitled to switch to 
another insurer, until (s)he pays his/her debt. Around 60 % of all the 
people who refuse to pay, do this because of their freeriding strategy, 
while 40 % are forced by their economics circumstances to do so [47]. 
The amount of people, who despite the mandatory character of health 
coverage remain uninsured, is unknown but expected to be very low. 
4.9. Precondition 9. Effective quality supervision 
In all five countries the consumer is protected against quackery and 
substandard quality care by formal regulations concerning professional 
licensing, formal complaints about poor quality of care and malpractice 
suits in the courts [5] and in all countries there is an independent 
monitoring of the quality of care. 
In Belgium the quality supervision in 2022 is largely comparable to 
that in 2012. The same holds for Germany where the Joint Federal 
Committee produces guidelines on quality. Providers in Germany are 
obliged to perform according to the quality guidelines, must establish a 
quality management system and must take part in external activities of 
quality measurement. Regional doctors’ associations are obliged to 
control the quality their members produce. 
In Israel the Program for the Quality of Community Care Measures 
annually collects quality indicators obtained from the four health in­
surers. Till 2012 this Program published an aggregate report, but since 
2012 it publishes the indicators per health insurer. In 2013 a similar 
program was introduced by the Ministry of Health for inpatient care. 
Other than that, the individual patient might find further information on 
quality of care by consulting the internet sites and local social media. 
In the Netherlands since 2014 the National Healthcare Institute (ZIN) 
has the task to improve the quality of care and to make it more trans­
parent in cooperation with relevant stakeholders in the healthcare 
sector. ZIN has to assess quality standards (i.e., professional standards 
and guidelines) and quality indicators, which are published on the 
publicly accessible website ‘zorginzicht’ [18]. Compared to 2012 the 
information on quality in 2022 has become better accessible and has 
been improved, particularly in case of hospitals. 
In Switzerland in 2012 there was quality monitoring of hospitals only 
W.P.M.M. van de Ven et al.

in some cantons and all monitoring reports were classified. In 2022 there 
is nationwide monitoring of inpatient care by the federal office based on 
outcome measurement and all the detailed monitoring results are pub­
lished on a website [27]. 
4.10. Precondition 10. Guaranteed access to basic care 
In Germany and Switzerland, the extent to which access to basic care 
is guaranteed is in 2022 the same as in 2012 (see Table 2). 
In Belgium and the Netherlands there is a growing concern about 
supply shortages and increasing waiting times, mainly for general 
practitioners, mental health care and for some specialties. In general, 
waiting times are very long for mental healthcare. 
In Israel, since 2012 access to basic care deteriorated and in 2022 
seems to exist more on paper than in reality. A recent survey found that 
in case of need only 60 % of the population expect to get the necessary 
care from the public healthcare system, while 51 % of those needing 
medical care, gave up the use of public services and turned to private 
providers, paid (partly) by the supplementary insurances [48]. 
5. Conclusion and discussion 
In this paper we have evaluated to what extent ten important pre­
conditions for achieving efficiency and affordability in competitive 
healthcare markets are fulfilled in Belgium, Germany, Israel, the 
Netherlands, and Switzerland in 2022, and to what extent this changed 
since 2012. 
Table 2 presents the subjective assessments by the authors of the 
extent to which these preconditions were fulfilled in the five countries in 
2022 and the differences with the assessments in 2012. Our assessments 
are based on the changes in preconditions in the period 2012–2022 as 
described in this paper and on the extensive description of these pre­
conditions in 2012 [5]. So, the two papers are complementary. Because 
the scores are given by the same authors, the 2022-scores are compa­
rable to the 2012-scores. 
Table 2 shows that for 64 of the total 95 scores (19 scores per 
country, 5 countries) the 2022-scores are the same as the 2012-scores, 
whereas 20 scores are higher, and 11 scores are lower than in 2012. 
As in 2012, we find that in none of the countries all preconditions are 
fulfilled completely, while there is substantial variation across countries 
in the extent to which the preconditions are fulfilled. In 2022, the pre­
conditions ‘free consumer choice of insurer’, ‘cross-subsidies without 
opportunities for free riders’ and ‘effective quality supervision’ are 
largely fulfilled in all five countries. With one exception (Israel) the 
same holds for the precondition ‘guaranteed access to basic care’, while 
in two other countries this precondition was in 2022 slightly less well- 
fulfilled than in 2012. The precondition ‘risk-bearing buyers and 
sellers’ is largely fulfilled in all countries except Belgium. In both years, 
preconditions that were least fulfilled are ‘contestable markets’, 
‘freedom to contract and integrate’, and ‘effective competition regula­
tion’. Interestingly, these preconditions are also most directly related to 
safeguarding competition, which may signal the ambiguous political 
stance towards competition in health care in many countries. The only 
preconditions that were improved in most countries were ‘consumer 
information and transparency’ and ‘cross-subsidies without incentives 
for risk selection’. Despite improvements in the risk equalization system 
(except for Israel), there are still substantial incentives for risk selection, 
which is a problem because of its adverse effects [10]. In comparison to 
2012, the precondition ‘guaranteed access to care’ is in 2022 less ful­
filled in Belgium, Israel, and the Netherlands. On balance the 
Netherlands and Switzerland made most progress in the number of 
better fulfilled preconditions. 
For Belgium the preconditions no longer seem relevant because in 
2022 the idea of regulated competition in healthcare, which was never 
strongly supported, is completely abandoned in Belgian health policy. 
The Belgian government has decreed to give up the system of individual 
financial responsibility for health insurers and to replace this by collec­
tive responsibility. Individual insurers never received the instruments 
and financial incentives to become a purchaser of care. This illustrates 
that in the 1990s the ‘financial responsibility’ for the Belgian social 
health insurers has been introduced without any open discussion about 
the implications this would/should have for the way of structuring and 
organizing the healthcare system. The health insurers are participating 
very actively in the policy process, but this process is not based on 
market forces. It consists of political negotiations in a complex structure 
of committees. 
In Israel in the last decade there were improvements in the pre­
conditions for efficiency, e.g., major improvements in the public pro­
vision of consumer information about both health insurance products 
and medical services. By contrast, however, the preconditions for 
affordability worsened. Guaranteed access to good, timely care seems to 
exist more on paper and in principle than in reality. Due to a lack of 
substantial improvements in the Israeli risk equalization formula, there 
are still large incentives for risk selection, resulting in adverse effects. A 
major negative selection effect is the distortion of the competition 
among the insurers on the availability and quality of care [37]. 
Furthermore, a remarkable finding is that, as in 2012, the preconditions 
‘effective competition policy’ and ‘contestability of the markets’ are still 
not fulfilled at all in 2022, although they are straightforward pre­
conditions for competitive healthcare markets (which are assumed to 
improve efficiency). 
In Germany and Switzerland, the preconditions ‘effective competition 
policy’ and ‘contestability of the markets’ are also not sufficiently ful­
filled in 2022, just as in 2012. Another remarkable finding is that the 
precondition ‘freedom to contract and integrate’ is hardly/moderately 
fulfilled in Germany and Switzerland. In these countries the government 
or a cartel of insurers functions as the third-party purchaser of care, 
rather than individual insurers. However, as argued in our earlier paper 
[5], giving consumers a free choice of insurer only makes sense if the 
individual insurer is the third-party purchaser of care. Otherwise, the 
considerable effort in solving problems of risk selection is largely wasted 
because the potential efficiency gains are negligible. One may wonder 
whether this is a (long) interim-period towards regulated competition or 
whether it is going to be the long-term status quo. In the latter case one 
may doubt whether this is a sustainable model of healthcare organiza­
tion. The rationale of regulated competition in healthcare is that indi­
vidual insurers have the primary responsibility for purchasing or 
delivering care. There seems to be no rationale for allowing consumer 
choice among risk bearing insurers if insurers cannot distinguish 
themselves as individual purchasers of care. 
In the Netherlands there is much debate about the question to what 
extent competing healthcare providers are allowed to cooperate with 
each other and whether the provision of healthcare should be more 
‘regionalized’. The Dutch competition authority (ACM) has clearly 
indicated that such cooperation is allowed if the consumer substantially 
benefits from this cooperation. Nevertheless, under public and political 
pressure the role and effectiveness of the Dutch competition regulation 
in healthcare has been reduced. 
Overall, the progress towards realizing the preconditions for regu­
lated competition has been limited. This finding may be relevant for 
other countries (considering) implementing regulated competition in 
healthcare. There are several potential explanations for this limited 
progress. First, technical complexity may have hindered progress, e.g., 
in the development of an adequate risk equalization system. Second, 
progress may have been effectively counteracted by resistance from 
interest groups, e.g., the providers of care who oppose a competitive 
healthcare market and selective contracting by the insurers [49] and 
oppose the publication of comparable information about the quality of 
care at the level of individual providers of care. Third, there appears to 
be a diminishing political support for the model of regulated competi­
tion, which might be partly explained by the limited empirical evidence 
showing that this model would outperform others and partly by a more 
W.P.M.M. van de Ven et al.

critical stance towards the role of markets in (predominantly) public 
sectors. Clearly, it would be methodologically very hard to empirically 
test the effect of the model of regulated competition, even if all pre­
conditions would be fulfilled. Hence, it would also be difficult to 
establish to what extent which preconditions have to be fulfilled to 
achieve reasonable levels of efficiency and affordability in competitive 
healthcare markets, the more so because this also depends on the local 
context and the prevailing social norms and values. Nevertheless, as it is 
likely that regulated competition may yield more desired outcomes the 
more the preconditions are fulfilled, it is worthwhile to work on 
improving these preconditions if regulated competition is the prevailing 
model for health system organization.

China faces a healthcare challenge due to its aging population, necessitating an integrated old-age 
healthcare system considering multiple stakeholders’ interests. Conflict and inequality may arise 
from varying stakeholder interests. This study develops a conflict resolution strategy for the co­
ordination of stakeholders involved in the old-age healthcare service system, promoting harmo­
nization and minimizing conflict to establish an equitable system meeting elderly needs. It 
contributes to a robust healthcare system for comprehensive, quality care. The focus of the study 
is to identify relevant stakeholders and decision-makers involved in developing an integrated old- 
age healthcare service system and explore a feasible solution through stakeholder analysis using 
the Mitchell score-based technique and stakeholder theory. Decision-makers’ preferences are 
estimated using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). Solution strategies are developed through 
multiple stability concepts within the graph model for conflict resolution (GMCR). The conflict 
resolution analysis based on the integrated AHP-GMCR approach reveals that the development of 
an integrated old-age healthcare system is feasible by addressing potential conflicts among the 
stakeholders. Considering the current predicament of comprehensive medical services in China, 
governments should distribute authority, simplify procedures, and improve the insurance system. 
Furthermore, medical institutions should explore funding options, expand services, and enhance 
accessibility. Elderly individuals should prioritize healthy aging and seek suitable healthcare 
providers. Stakeholder participation is crucial for effective implementation. These recommen­
dations enable China to advance integrated elderly care successfully, addressing challenges posed 
by the aging population.

1. Introduction 
The growing proportion of the elderly population, coupled with an increasing number of mentally disabled individuals and empty- 
nesters in Chinese society, has highlighted the need for an integrated old-age healthcare services system and targeted medical 
treatment [1–3]. Meeting the varied needs of the elderly is challenging as they depend solely on children or family members [4,5]. This 
makes the development of an integrated social support and old-age healthcare system crucial [6,7]. However, it is essential to develop 
an integrated system for elderly and aged citizens that considers China’s specific national conditions, emphasizing a long-term 
perspective [3,8,9]. While China has experienced marvelous economic growth and development, progress has been made in inte­
grated elderly healthcare. 
However, existing systems face various challenges, including policy system fragmentation, inadequate supportive policies, lack of 
relevant laws and regulations, unclear institutional positioning, inconsistent linkages between medical and nursing organizations, 
inefficient resource allocation, imbalances in service supply and demand, and unfair competition among institutions [10–12]. 
Implementing a policy that combines medical care with nursing involves the interest of multiple stakeholders. Successful imple­
mentation must involve the active participation and coordination of all stakeholders, ensure smooth progress, and address potential 
difficulties that may arise during the implementation process. Establishing a win-win relationship among all stakeholders is of utmost 
importance. To achieve this, it is vital to understand the demands and concerns of each stakeholder, clarify their dilemmas, and 
establish a coordination mechanism that effectively balances conflicts and aligns the interests of all parties involved in integrated 
elderly care. 
The present study aims to develop a decision analysis strategy to deal with the conflict that evolved in developing and providing 
integrated healthcare to the aged population due to conflicting interests and inequalities among the relevant stakeholders in China. For 
this purpose, the authors put this conflict into perspective and developed an integrated decision analysis approach by integrating the 
Mitchell score-based approach, AHP, and GMCR. Furthermore, the authors identified the relevant stakeholders and decision-makers 
(DMs) and traced their interests related to healthcare services to the aged population. Because the preferences of the DMs play an 
indispensable role in determining the outcomes of a decision-making problem, Mitchell score-based and AHP methods were used to 
generate the ranking of the strategies. Moving further, these preferences have been used to examine conflict and trace solution 
strategies for the development of an integrated healthcare service system in China. The GMCR-AHP framework presents the findings of 
conflict forecasting and process analysis in this domain, establishing mechanisms to coordinate medical needs and relevant subject 
interests. This analysis offers more detailed guidelines and insights for decision-making in developing an integrated elderly care system 
in China. 
2. Background 
2.1. Literature review 
In 2005, Chinese scholars introduced the concept of integrating medical and nursing care, emphasizing the need for continuous 
care. This concept was first proposed to develop nationally integrated medical and nursing care. However, several challenges have 
emerged during the initial implementation phase, including overlapping responsibilities among authorities, unclear boundaries of 
responsibility, service misalignment, and widespread illegal practices within nursing care institutions [11,13]. Through exploration 
and efforts, progress has been made in China’s integrated elderly care system. Three main models have emerged: pension-type 
combinations, community-based care, and home-based care [14]. However, issues such as inconsistent service quality, inadequate 
matching of supply and demand, and lack of supportive policies have become new obstacles impeding the advancement of integrated 
medical and nursing care services [15,16]. 
The studies have identified a disparity between supply and demand in the integrated care system, attributed primarily to coor­
dination and governance difficulties among different departments, misalignment of demand targeting, and low engagement from 
service providers [12,17]. Existing studies have focused on three main aspects of this supply-demand discrepancy: first, the spatial 
distribution of elderly care resources is imbalanced, with insufficient overall supply and underutilized resources, particularly in 
community-based care services [18,19]; second, the high-end elderly care industry has developed rapidly, while the development of 
small- and medium-sized care institutions lags, resulting in an imbalance between service demands and supply [20,21]; Third, the 
regional distribution of elderly care services is highly influenced by economic disparities, with economically developed areas expe­
riencing robust supply and demand, while economically underdeveloped areas face weaker supply and demand [22–24]. Furthermore, 
scholars have emphasized that the integration of medical and elderly care exacerbates the structural contradiction between the supply 
and demand of medical services, necessitating the exploration of new medical care models [11]. 
Currently, inadequate integration between medical and nursing resources encompasses the consolidation and reallocation of these 
resources as well as the management system and operational mechanisms. This issue fundamentally involves the interests of relevant 
departments, groups, and individuals [25]. The researchers explored the collaboration among multiple stakeholders in an integrated 
medical-support pension model. They emphasized that the government should not be the sole actor and that market forces alone 
cannot drive the development of this model. Instead, a multifaceted operational mechanism that fosters participation and integrates 
interests should be established [26]. Utilizing the IDEA strategic model, four coordination mechanisms were defined for providers in 
integrated medical and supported care based on the dimensions of "relationship" and "interest” [27,28]. This approach systematically 
analyzed how coordination can be achieved among multiple providers in integrated medical and support care for the elderly [29]. By 
employing game analysis and considering the government, medical institutions, and enterprises in the western region of China, one

study pointed out that practical cooperation among the government, hospitals, and social enterprises is essential in the face of 
challenges related to systems, resources, and information. With government policy guidance, these stakeholders should promote 
resource sharing, healthcare services, talent exchanges, and scientific and technological advancements. This collaborative approach 
explores the unique characteristics of the Western regions’ integrated medical and elderly care models [6,30]. 
Chinese academics have actively investigated merging medical and aged care models. The focus of this study has evolved from a 
limited to a broader perspective, resulting in more significant insights and some research outputs. Numerous studies have addressed 
obstacles to implementing integrated medical and aged care, highlighting concerns such as limitations in the growth of medical and 
elderly care firms and supply and demand mismatches. Researchers from many viewpoints have presented numerous remedies and 
proposals, recognizing that integrating medical resources is critical for developing medical and senior care integration. However, 
measuring stakeholders’ willingness and preferences remains challenging, and further studies on building multi-stakeholder coop­
eration mechanisms for integrated medical and nursing care are needed. Therefore, research in these areas must be strengthened. 
2.2. Theoretical basis 
Stakeholder theory originated in the 1930s and defines stakeholders as groups or individuals who can impact or are affected by the 
achievement of organizational goals [31–33] introduced stakeholder theory to the health field; since then, it has gained widespread 
application and demonstrated its relevance. In the Chinese context, stakeholder theory has been utilized in various areas including 
health policy research, health institution management, and medical and health reform [34,35]. This theory emphasizes the presence of 
multiple stakeholders who can be examined from different perspectives. These stakeholders have a direct connection with policy 
implementation or goal attainment. They may share risks, bear costs, supervise, or impose constraints on implementing policies or 
achieving objectives [32]. Considering the stakeholder theory approach, this study analyzes the relationship between medical care and 
relevant stakeholders from multiple angles, clarifying their interdependencies and laying the groundwork for conflict analysis 
modeling. 
Conflicting interests among stakeholders within an integrated nursing care setting can give rise to inconsistent conflicts in their 
game behavior [34]. Obtaining preference data for the game becomes challenging, and establishing alignment among various 
stakeholders is crucial to advancing their interests. Therefore, there is a need to employ precise data and decision-making methods to 
address minor conflicts. The GMCR offers such an approach, drawing from classical game theory and partial game theory [36]. In a 
decision-analysis problem, it is important to consider all DMs and their preferences. GMCR provides this liberty to DMs while putting 
the decision problem into perspective and making it possible to reach a feasible solution [37,38]. It enables the modeling and reso­
lution of conflict problems, providing decision-makers with practical and scientifically grounded solutions. The GMCR method exhibits 
the benefits of a flexible modeling framework that combines qualitative and quantitative analyses. It replaces the utility value 
approach with a relative order, reducing the information required for the decision maker’s preferences [39]. In comparison, classical 
game theory is more convenient and adaptable, whereas conflict resolution methods [40] are widely used in various domains involving 
conflicts related to energy and water resources [41,42], market competition, and military contexts [39]. 
3. GMCR 
The GMCR can be defined as V = {N,S,P,G}, where N (N ≥2) represents a finite and non-empty set encompassing all decision- 
makers involved in the conflict. ‘S’ denotes a non-empty set consisting of all feasible states. ‘P’ represents the preference informa­
tion of the decision-makers, and ‘G’ signifies the decision-maker’s state transition graph model [36,43,44]. GMCR resolves conflict 
problems by analyzing the conflict context, identifying decision-makers and their strategies, eliminating infeasible states, determining 
feasible states and their transitions, analyzing preference information, and conducting stability analysis to derive global equilibrium 
solutions. The stability analysis outcomes can provide decision-makers with valuable support in navigating conflict-resolution 
processes. 
In GMCR theory, preference [37,38,45,46] refers to the pros and cons of the states obtained by DMs according to their own desired 
goals and judgment of conflicts. We express the simple preference structure of decision-maker I as follows: P = {∼i,≻i}, “≻”and “~” 
represent information about a DMs’ preferences for different states, respectively. For example, for any two possible states s,q ∈S, s≻iq 
denotes for decision maker i, the state ‘s’ is better than state q, q≻is said state q is better than state ‘s’,’ s∼iq denotes for decision maker 
i, states is equivalent to state q. For any two feasible states s,q ∈S, the following properties are satisfied [47]: 
First property: ≻i satisfies the asymmetry. For s,q ∈S, both s≻iq and q≻is cannot be true. 
Second property: ∼i satisfies the reflexivity and symmetry. For s,q ∈S, s∼is is true and is called reflexivity. 
If s∼iq, so q∼is, called symmetry. 
Third property: {∼i, ≻i} satisfies the completeness. For , q ∈S , s≻iq, s∼iq, and q≻is must satisfy one of them. 
At the same time, s≻iq is the same thing as either s≻iq or s∼iq, and s≺iq is the same thing as q≻is. 
The four basic stability types commonly used in GMCR are Nash stability, General Metarational stability (GMR), Symmetric 
Metarational stability (SMR), and Sequential stability (SEQ). To facilitate the calculation, using the logical definitions of the conflict 
analysis diagram model, Xu et al. [48,49] presented four matrix definitions of basic stability.

4. Conflict analysis modeling solution 
4.1. Conflict background analysis 
China transitioned to an aging society in 1999, and this demographic shift has persisted for over 20 years. To address the challenges 
posed by the aging population, the combined medical and elderly care model has emerged as an integral approach. This integration has 
played a vital role in alleviating the pressures associated with an aging society and in advancing elderly care services in China. 
However, the current state of policy implementation presents several challenges. First, relevant government departments must fulfill 
their roles effectively. Numerous government bodies are involved in the medical sector, serving people and their interests in various 
capacities [50,51]. However, in their operations, it becomes challenging for them to avoid pursuing their interests and adopting 
strategies that favor the establishment of specific institutions, referred to as "keep institutions." These institutions tend to impede the 
timely examination and approval of qualifications and fail to provide timely feedback, resulting in ineffective problem-solving. While 
coordination may exist among departments such as the Commission on Aging, more administrative powers within its internal in­
stitutions are needed to ensure their ability to address complex issues that impact the integration of medical and pension resources [3]. 
This situation also affects the success or failure of medical policies and significantly affects the market’s enthusiasm for providing 
medical nursing services. Moreover, integrated care for the elderly weakens the links with necessary reforms. The current combination 
of government-dominated institutions relies on something other than market operations, as China’s social governance mechanisms 
tend to follow a top-down approach [52]. Consequently, the participation of stakeholders beyond the immediate government de­
partments could be higher and more active, leading to a limited expression of their interests [53]. 
Third, there is a need for more enthusiasm for cooperation among medical institutions. Extensive healthcare facilities focus pri­
marily on providing routine medical services. Owing to the scarcity of medical resources, these institutions face high service costs. 
Furthermore, the nature of welfare-oriented medical care limits its ability to generate substantial profit. As a result, large medical 
institutions need more initiative and enthusiasm to promote policies related to combined medical care and nursing. Most primary 
healthcare institutions are publicly funded and lack performance incentive mechanisms. Additionally, the elderly, as a demographic 
group, are more susceptible to medical disputes and associated with lower profits. Consequently, primary medical and health in­
stitutions demonstrate limited enthusiasm for catering to the needs of elderly patients and resist the integration of medical care with 
nursing. 
Fourth, there is a misalliance between supply and demand for integrated care for the elderly. With the government’s policy of 
combining medical and nursing care, many small pension institutions have ventured to establish medical facilities. However, their 
limited capacity and funding constraints hinder their ability to address complex medical issues, such as hospitalization. This lack of 
clarity regarding the role of medical care exacerbates resource waste. Additionally, integrating high-end medical services into large 
pension institutions contributes to resource inefficiencies due to the high fees. 
Fifth, it is challenging to translate the individual needs of the elderly into social needs. Nursing services in medical institutions are 
driven by economic considerations, which result in high costs. Consequently, many elderly individuals with limited financial resources 
cannot afford these services and are reluctant to bear the burden of high charges. Moreover, medical institutions cannot recover costs 
through medical insurance reimbursement or basic annuities, which are insufficient to alleviate economic pressure or transform the 
individual needs of the elderly for medical nursing services into a societal need. This leads to a surplus of available beds, wasting 
institutional resources and diminishing social welfare. Such outcomes are considered a deviation from the original intention of the 
policy of combining medical and nursing care, hindering its progress [25]. 
Sixth, issues are related to low and unequal coverage of long-term care insurance policies. These policies aim to address the nursing 
care needs of disabled and elderly individuals and to alleviate the challenges they and their families face. However, the actual 
implementation of these policies extends only to urban and rural residents. Moreover, assessment standards vary significantly from 
location to location, resulting in severe inequalities and inefficient utilization of medical insurance funds, even posing a risk of 
overdrafts. 
Seventh, the traditional concepts of aging and family play a significant role. Many elderly individuals strongly adhere to traditional 
beliefs that place the responsibility of caring for their children. Consequently, they are unwilling to accept services from pension 
institutions including medical care facilities. This mindset discourages governments from fully implementing policies that combine 
medical and nursing care. 
Integrated care for the elderly involves various stakeholders with diverse demands that have yet to converge into a consensus for 
the implementation process. This situation poses a dilemma in this field. Constructing a comprehensive mechanism for combined

medical and nursing care is essentially a process of balancing the interests of all stakeholders [25]. Therefore, it is imperative to seek an 
optimal strategy that effectively balances all relevant parties’ interests and ensures the successful and efficient implementation of the 
best policy. 
4.2. Definition of integrated care for the elderly with stakeholders and the analysis of interest demand 
While developing an integrated care system for the elderly, several vital stakeholders play crucial roles, including the government, 
medical institutions, pension institutions, representative elderly groups, and families [25,54]. The government encompasses various 
departments such as the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), Ministry of Civil Affairs and Social Security (MOCA), 
Ministry of Finance (MOF), Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security (MOHRSS) (The People Club Department), National 
Health Commission (NHC), Ministry of Land and Resources, Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development, Elders’ Office, Bureau 
of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Commission on Aging (COA), and Office of Aging. By applying stakeholder theory, this study employs 
the Mitchell scoring method to classify stakeholders involved in the integrated care system for the elderly. The stakeholders were 
grouped into three categories. We have classified DMs into three groups, including defined stakeholders, prospective stakeholders, and 
potential stakeholders. Moreover, each type of grouping is a set of DMs with the same properties but different numbers. Then, we 
assign scores to any type of decision-maker from four aspects, including legitimacy, urgency, power, and position. It is obvious that the 
assignment of scores to a certain aspect is not a specific numerical value, but is described using different levels of language. 
Government departments are responsible for implementing medical care and catering to aging citizens, including the NDRC, 
MOCA, MOF, MOHRSS, NHC, COA, and Office of Ageing. Prospective stakeholders include medical institutions at all levels, pension 
institutions, representative elderly groups, and families. Potential stakeholders include health products and drug manufacturers, 
sellers of auxiliary devices, commercial insurance companies, and other for-profit organizations. While some entities may fulfill 
multiple functions and assume multiple roles, for clarity, this study focuses on analyzing the primary roles of stakeholders, as outlined 
in Table 1. The research data in this article mainly comes from public information, such as government announcements, research 
reports, etc. [25,51,54]. 
The attitudes of various stakeholders towards integrating medical and nursing care policies are pivotal in either facilitating or 
impeding policy implementation. Stakeholders’ positions and attitudes are influenced by their interest in and satisfaction with policy 
execution. As the guardian of citizens’ rights and interests, the government assumes the roles of policymakers, promoters, and 
overseers in the combination of medical and elderly care. The government aims to alleviate the pressure of an aging population and 
foster the integration of medical and elderly care resources through comprehensive policy measures. Whether driven by safeguarding 
citizens’ rights and interests or by enhancing the utilization of social resources, government departments generally support policies 
that integrate medical and nursing care. 
Medical institutions and pension service providers are direct providers of integrated medical and nursing care. As profit-oriented 
entities, medical institutions and pension service providers seek to maximize their benefits. They strive to secure favorable policies and 
financial subsidies while also attempting to increase the pricing of medical services as recipients and ultimate beneficiaries of medical 
care services. The elderly and their families aspire to fulfill the needs of the elderly population by advocating for the policy of 
combining medical and nursing care, which ensures continuous and high-quality medical services. 
Potential stakeholders, such as drug manufacturers, auxiliary device manufacturers, and commercial insurance institutions, pri­
marily aim to gain a larger market share and augment their profits by implementing relevant policies. This perspective is detailed in 
Table 2, which highlights the interests and motivations of these stakeholders.

5. The analysis 
5.1. Analysis of decision makers and their strategies 
In the context of the implementation challenges faced in combining medical and nursing care, the term "Decision Maker" (DM) 
refers to individuals or groups who can make decisions independently. A conflict event requires the presence of at least two DMs with 
distinct interests. This study identified three primary stakeholders as decision-makers in the conflict surrounding the combination of 
medical and nursing care. These stakeholders included the government (DM1), medical care and nursing institutions (DM2), and the 
elderly group (DM3). The interrelationships among these DMs are illustrated in Fig. 1. Considering the conflict’s backdrop, each DM 
has three strategy choices available, as outlined in Table 3. 
5.2. Feasible state and state transition diagram construction 
The conflict diagram model consists of three DMs and nine strategies. Table 4 presents the selection status of each strategy using "Y"

to indicate the selection, "N" for non-selection, and "-" for strategies that can be either selected or not. The strategies selected by all 
decision makers form various permutations and combinations, represented by feasible and infeasible states in the graphical model (e. 
g., —Y—N——YY—). In this study, there are nine options, resulting in a theoretical total of 29 states that reflect the conflicting 
outcomes of decision-maker strategies. 
However, in reality, certain strategies may contradict or depend on one another, rendering some of the 29 states impossible or 
infeasible. The infeasible states must be identified and eliminated. For instance, the elderly population can only choose either strategy 
⑦ or strategy ⑧, making the state (——————YY—) invalid. By incorporating a rejection state and utilizing GMCR II software, it is 
possible to eliminate the remaining 16 possible states, as shown in Table 4. 
In some cases, DMs may modify their strategies to safeguard their interests or expedite conflict resolution. However, while some 
DMs retain their strategies, this change from one DM alters the conflict dynamics and transitions the current state to a different state. 
This phenomenon is known as a state transition. For instance, if the government (DM1) and medical care institutions (DM2) maintain 
their previous strategies while the elderly population (DM3) adopts a new strategy to shift from traditional pension concepts and 
emphasize the importance of healthy aging, the conflict may transition from state S1 to state S2. 
The feasibility states of the conflict and the state transitions of the decision makers are represented by a comprehensive directed 
graph called the graph model (Fig. 2). This model illustrates a three-state transition diagram for each decision-maker. Feasible and 
infeasible states are depicted as solid black dots in the graph. Sixteen feasible states exist within the state transition graph model. The 
arrows indicate the direction of transition from the initial state to the accessible state. A single arrow represents one-way transfer, 
whereas a double arrow indicates reversible state transition. Different line types correspond to different DMs in the model. 
5.3. Policymakers’ preferences and strategy statements 
The Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) [55–57] is a practical decision-making method that enables the evaluation of multiple 
schemes or objectives. It effectively integrates qualitative and quantitative analyses, thereby facilitating a hierarchical and quanti­
tative decision-making process. Using the AHP method, decision indicators were structured into a hierarchical model, expert ratings 
were collected, and judgment matrices were constructed. This article is a preference evaluation of six different strategies in conflict 
problems and the evaluation criteria are based on the preference criteria of the decision-maker’s background and status. We evaluate 
the six strategies based on the individual criteria of DMs. The YAahp software was utilized to compute and finalize hierarchical 
rankings, along with conducting tests for consistency. The derived ranking of strategy weights is showcased in Table 5, offering a 
definitive basis for decision-making grounded in the AHP methodology. 
5.4. Stability analysis to find equilibrium solution 
Conflict stability refers to a decision maker’s behavioral pattern in a conflict situation. When a player does not transition unilat­
erally to a better state at a particular point, that state is considered stable for that decision-maker. If a state exists that is stable for all 
decision-makers, it is considered a conflict equilibrium solution. Table 6 shows that under GMR, SMR, and SEQ, the ultimate equi­
librium points are S2, S4, S6, S8, S12, and S16. Under the Nash equilibrium, S16 is the ultimate equilibrium point. It is generally 
believed that a solution that satisfies the Nash equilibrium, GMR, SMR, and SEQ simultaneously is a global equilibrium solution [43, 
44,49,58]. Therefore, in this conflict event, the global equilibrium solution is State 16 (YYNYYNYNY). 
This solution implies that the government needs to overcome the institutional dilemma posed by bureaucratic organizational 
structures. It should enhance coordination and cooperation among various departments, streamline administration, delegate power, 
optimize the qualification approval process for medical care institutions, and improve the medical insurance system. Such governance 
structure could be developed by adopting ICT technologies in the governance structure. Cordella and Tempini [59] support this 
adoption by suggesting e-government and organizational change in bureaucracy in public service delivery. Furthermore, shared

decision-making could be productive in dealing with the issues related to complex needs of older people [60]. Additionally, the 
establishment and improvement of long-term care insurance should go beyond just maintaining the status quo. This findings is also 
supported by the findings of [61,62]. Medical and nursing institutions should adopt a strategy for forming consortia, increasing the 
availability of middle-end medical and nursing facilities to meet public needs, diversifying financing channels, and enriching funding 
sources. They need to prioritize the provision of quality care rather than solely pursuing economic benefits or indiscriminately raising 
charges. The elderly population should consider purchasing medical care services and long-term care insurance while also challenging 
traditional pension concepts and actively promoting awareness of healthy aging. Instead of opting for conventional pension in­
stitutions with high fees, they should explore alternatives as outlined in Table 6. 
5.5. Analysis of conflict evolution path 
Table 7 presents the optimal evolution path of the conflict event, following the principles of resource conservation, from initial state 
S1 (NNYNNYNYN) to equilibrium state S16 (YYNYYNYNY). The arrows indicate unilateral strategy changes by DMs, leading to state 
transitions. In response to the conflict and dilemma, the government, serving as the policy maker, implementer, and regulator of the 
medical-care integration policy and the representative and protector of people’s interests, takes an active leadership role. 
The government breaks through hierarchical organizational structures and enhances coordination among various departments. It 
streamlines administration, delegates power, optimizes the qualification approval process for medical institutions, and improves the

systems of medical and long-term care insurance, moving the state from S1 to S5. Simultaneously, medical and nursing institutions 
abandoned their blind pursuit of economic benefits and established a consortium of medical and nursing institutions. 
By increasing the availability of middle-end medical and nursing facilities to cater to public needs, they broaden their financing 
channels and diversify their funding sources. This transition progressed from S5 to S13. In response to the changes made by the 
government and medical institutions, the elderly gradually alter their traditional notions of endowment, strengthen their awareness of 
healthy aging, and choose to purchase medical services. This prompts the transition from state S13 to state S16, ultimately reaching a 
global equilibrium. 
In this state, conflicts among the decision-makers are resolved, maximizing the interests of all parties involved. An equilibrium 
situation can be achieved by navigating through conflicts. 
5.6. Limitations of research 
The limitation of this study lies in the complexity of conflict and promoting coordination for an integrated old-age healthcare 
service system in China. However, the decision-maker options summarized by existing graph models may be too vague, resulting in 
discrepancies between the analysis results and the actual situation. This is also a major research direction in the future, how to 
characterize the fuzzy preference relationships of decision-makers within graph models. 
5.7. Comparative analysis between GMCR and existing consensus creation methods  
(1) As shown in original GMCR definitions, it includes two different stages: modeling and analysis. Considering the shortcomings of 
the current preference ranking methods in the analysis stage, this paper first considers using AHP to obtain each DM’s pref­
erence ranking methods over all states. In other words, quantitative consensus creation methods such as AHP and other 
quantitative consensus creation methods are just used to determine DM’s real preference ranking in the modeling stage of 
GMCR. As for quantitative consensus creation tools, their effects are also the same. Thus, compared with existing research 
methods, the proposed method in this paper not only has the advantages of GMCR but also has the advantages of consensus 
creation tools.  
(2) Compared to other quantitative existing consensus creation, the proposed method in this paper can be used to model and 
analyze real-life conflict. However, quantitative existing consensus creation is just used to rank all states for each DM in the 
framework of GMCR. Thus, the proposed method is more professional and scientific in handling conflicts. Particularly, to 
resolve conflict and promote coordination for an integrated old-age healthcare service system in China, this paper first uses the 
quantitative existing consensus method called AHP to determine the preference in the framework of GMCR. 
6. Conclusions and future works 
6.1. Research conclusions 
Achieving a global equilibrium solution for resolving conflicts in integrated care for the elderly and promoting its development 
requires coordinated efforts from multiple stakeholders, including government departments, medical institutions, elder care in­
stitutions, and the elderly. Market regulation and collaboration among these entities are crucial. Government departments should 
enhance coordination and cooperation among different departments, streamline administrative processes, delegate power effectively, 
and optimize the examinations and approval procedures of medical care institutions. Additionally, improvements in the medical in­
surance system and the establishment and enhancement of long-term care insurance are essential priorities. Medical and pension 
service institutions should collaborate actively by forming medical and nursing associations. This collaboration enables them to in­
crease the availability of middle-end medical and nursing care services, aligning with the needs of the public. These institutions need to 
diversify their construction and operational channels while enriching their funding sources. It is equally crucial for them to avoid 
arbitrary fee increases and to focus on providing quality care. The elderly population plays a significant role in this regard. They should 
actively work towards transforming the traditional concepts of elderly care. By strengthening their awareness of healthy aging, they 
can generate demand for medical care services and overcome the challenges of combining medical and nursing care. By collectively 
addressing these aspects, stakeholders can contribute to resolving conflicts and dilemmas in integrated care for the elderly, paving the 
way for successful development and implementation. 
Compared with existing research methods, the method proposed in this article quantitatively analyzes conflict and promoting 
coordination for an integrated old-age healthcare service system in China, the research process is simple and effective, and the research 
conclusions are more reliable. The research results of this article can be directly and effectively applied to obtaining solutions to real- 
life conflicts.  
(1) Promote coordination and cooperation to break through the institutional difficulties of the bureaucratic organizational 
structure. 
Creating a scientific and practical institutional mechanism is crucial for the successful implementation of integrated care for the 
elderly. The current fragmented management approach with limited authority and overlapping responsibilities must be addressed by 
mobilizing cooperative enthusiasm among all departments. This requires breaking through hierarchical organizational structures and 
Y. Kong et al.

striving for a balanced interest among departments. To truly serve the people and achieve the strategic objectives of a healthy China 
and an aging population, superficial efforts must be replaced by substantive cooperation between pension services and medical in­
stitutions. Consideration of stakeholders’ appeals and requirements is essential for meaningful collaboration. Each department should 
clearly understand its responsibilities, and delineate its powers and obligations within the integrated mechanism. Collaboration and 
efficiency principles should guide the optimization of powers and responsibilities, ensuring clear boundaries and avoiding conflicts. A 
guided responsibility system should be established to allow government departments to collaborate, seek appropriate powers and 
responsibilities, and find a balance among themselves. Legal norms related to elderly policies, such as qualification examination and 
approval of medical institutions, healthcare, supervision, law enforcement powers, and ownership responsibilities, should be clarified 
to establish robust legal safeguards with distinct boundaries. Implementing these measures will establish a robust institutional 
framework that enables efficient and effective integrated healthcare for the elderly while upholding legal standards and fostering 
collaboration among all relevant departments.  
(2) Simplification of administrative procedures, empowered decision-making, and enhancement of the qualification inspection and 
approval process for medical care institutions 
The role of the government in the approval, management, and supervision of healthcare institutions is important for an effective 
and efficient healthcare service system. For this purpose, the government should focus on streamlining the policies and their objectives 
to formulate administrative structure, delegate power, introduce rules and regulations, and optimize the services. In this regard, the 
government should ensure the participation and engagement of the social and healthcare institutions including medical facility 
centers, pension and insurance institutions, and community centers. Furthermore, the facilitation of coordination of the institutions, 
and grading of referral systems along information-sharing platforms would add to the efforts to develop an integrated old-age 
healthcare service system. The responsibilities of the stakeholders need to be defined. These stakeholders include financing, land 
planning, taxation and subsidies, fees, availability of beds, and demographic databases of the aged population. 
Simplifying transactions and leveraging the strengths of different institutions will enhance resource integration. Additionally, the 
government should strengthen its supervision while streamlining administrative processes and delegating power. This ensures that 
institutions combining medical and nursing care can fulfill their roles effectively, focusing on medical functions and ensuring the 
quality of life and dignity of the elderly. By implementing these measures, the government can establish a robust framework that 
promotes efficiency, coordination, and accountability in integrated care. This will lead to improved healthcare services and higher 
quality of life for the elderly.  
(3) Improve the medical insurance system and establish and improve long-term care insurance 
Enhancing the medical insurance system and establishing comprehensive long-term care insurance can positively affect the elderly 
population. These measures can reduce economic burden, increase willingness to seek combined medical and nursing care, and 
stimulate overall consumption. They also attract social capital and market forces, expand funding sources for medical care institutions, 
and relieve the financial strain on the government. On the demand side, focusing on improving care for disabled and elderly in­
dividuals is crucial. It involves scientifically evaluating care needs and adjusting the eligibility criteria for long-term care insurance. 
Similar to those implemented in Beijing and Shanghai, standardized evaluation requirements can serve as models for other regions. On 
the supply side, expanding the scope of long-term care insurance services to cover both urban and rural residents helps bridge the 
urban-rural gap and ensure equitable access to care. Balancing in-home and institutional care within the insurance framework is also 
essential. While institutional care provides standardized regulations and better-quality care, it is necessary to address the short-term 
financing challenges faced by medical care institutions and the government. Standards, careful transition ratios, and speed must be 
established. Leveraging social and market forces is therefore crucial. Encouraging commercial insurance institutions to offer diverse 
long-term care insurance options helps to share the burden and meet the diverse pension needs of the population. This approach 
provides a range of choices that cater to different preferences and requirements, thus alleviating pressure on the government.  
(4) To build medical and nursing consortiums and increase the middle-end supply to meet the needs of the public. 
Ensuring the effective advancement of integrated care for the elderly population requires addressing their needs, adhering to 
supply-side reform principles, and optimizing strategies. The supply of integrated care services should cater to the diverse re­
quirements of the elderly, including different age groups, disabilities, chronic illnesses, and general health needs. One approach is to 
enhance the integration of medical and nursing care services and to expand their availability. This can be achieved by integrating 
medical care into existing pension services, incorporating pension care into existing medical services, or establishing collaborative 
models between medical and pension institutions. Transforming general hospitals into comprehensive pension service centers and 
developing new medical institutions within elder care facilities can promote resource efficiency and cater to specific needs. Prioritizing 
the demands and preferences of the elderly is crucial. Considering their ability to pay, health conditions, and personal preferences 
helps optimize resource allocation. It involves reducing low- and high-end services and increasing the availability of middle-end in­
tegrated care options that align with public demand. By aligning supply with these factors, the development of integrated care services 
can be more efficient and responsive to the needs of the elderly population. Addressing the specific needs of the elderly population and 
optimizing the supply of integrated care services ensures that the development of this field is in line with their requirements and 
contributes to their overall well-being. This promotes efficient resource allocation and enhances the quality and accessibility of 
Y. Kong et al.

integrated care services for the elderly population.  
(5) Strengthening awareness of healthy aging and stimulating potential demand for medical and nursing services 
The influence of traditional culture has shaped the perception that supporting the elderly is primarily the responsibility of inter­
generational relationships, thus impacting the utilization of institutional elder care services. Proactive measures are necessary to 
promote a broader understanding of support for the elderly. A clear definition of the target population, focusing on the elderly 
population, is crucial. Promotional efforts should consider the level of acceptance and employ emotionally compelling messages. Using 
vivid examples and diverse formats can effectively convey the importance of medical and elderly care concepts, enhancing engage­
ment and understanding among the elderly. Governments can facilitate the development of community-based integrated care models. 
In rural areas, existing grassroots medical institutions, such as township health centers and village clinics, can be tailored to meet the 
specific needs of the aging population. In urban areas, community health service institutions, such as elderly day-care centers and 
home care services, play a crucial role in providing comprehensive support for the elderly, enabling them to maintain their quality of 
life at home. By actively addressing cultural perspectives and employing targeted promotion strategies, societal attitudes toward elder 
care can be reshaped. This encourages the adoption of integrated care approaches that cater to the needs and preferences of the elderly. 
6.2. Future research prospects 
MAMCA (multi-attribute and multi-criteria analysis) [63] was created specifically for stakeholder groups with different objectives, 
motivations, and information. At the same time, consensus creation is a less subjective method, does not need further stakeholder 
participation but requires more mathematical calculations. However, these two preference acquisition methods have not yet been 
considered in the theoretical framework of graph models. Thus, in future research work, these two types of methods can be considered 
in the graph model framework to obtain preferences.

 Introduction
Mixed
 public
 and
 private
 ﬁnance
 is
 widespread
 in
 health
 systems
 internationally.
 Public
 ﬁnance
 predominates
 in
 most
countries
 (even
 in
 the
 US
 if
 tax
 expenditures
 associated
 with
 the
 tax
 treatment
 of
 private
 health
 care
 insurance
 are
 included),
while
 private
 ﬁnance
 plays
 a
 variety
 of
 (often
 controversial)
 roles
 that
 depend
 on
 the
 design
 of
 the
 ﬁnancing
 system.
 Private
ﬁnance
 can
 complement
 or
 substitute
 for
 public
 ﬁnance.
 Complementary
 private
 ﬁnance
 arises
 in
 all
 countries
 and
 includes,
for
 instance,
 private
 insurance
 for
 services
 not
 covered
 by
 the
 public
 plan
 or
 private
 purchases
 to
 “top-up”
 public
 cover-
age
 (e.g.,
 privately
 purchasing
 physiotherapy
 visits
 or
 home
 care
 beyond
 the
 amount
 covered
 by
 the
 public
 plan).
 Private
ﬁnance
 as
 a
 substitute
 for
 public
 ﬁnance
 take
 two
 basic
 forms:
 “opt-out,”
 whereby
 an
 individual
 purchases
 duplicate
 private
insurance
 for
 publicly
 insured
 services
 while
 still
 contributing
 taxes
 to
 support
 the
 public
 system,
 and
 “exit,”
 whereby

individual
 wholly
 withdraws
 from
 the
 public
 system,
 forfeiting
 both
 the
 right
 to
 obtain
 public
 care
 and
 the
 obligation
 to
contribute
 to
 ﬁnancing
 the
 public
 plan.
 Opting-out
 is
 allowed
 in
 most
 countries
 and
 plays
 a
 large
 role
 in
 countries
 such
 as
Australia,
 Portugal,
 Spain,
 and
 Ireland.
 Exit
 is
 less
 common,
 but
 played
 a
 prominent
 role
 in
 the
 Netherlands
 prior
 to
 its
 2006
reforms,
 is
 a
 prominent
 feature
 of
 the
 German
 system
 of
 health
 care
 ﬁnancing,
 and
 plays
 a
 smaller
 role
 in
 countries
 such
 as
Austria.
 Germany
 and
 Austria
 provide
 a
 conditional-exit
 option:
 only
 those
 individuals
 who
 satisfy
 speciﬁed
 conditions
 can
choose
 to
 exit,
 though
 the
 conditions
 differ
 by
 country.
 Germany
 speciﬁes
 an
 income
 condition
 whereby
 only
 those
 with
an
 annual
 income
 greater
 than
 the
 speciﬁed
 threshold
 (D
 54,900
 in
 2015)
 are
 eligible
 to
 exit
 the
 public
 system.
 In
 contrast,
Austria
 speciﬁes
 an
 occupation-based
 condition
 whereby
 only
 certain
 self-employed
 professionals
 are
 eligible
 to
 exit.
Mixed
 systems
 of
 public
 and
 private
 ﬁnance
 characterized
 by
 one
 or
 more
 of
 top-up,
 opt-out
 or
 exit
 are
 not
 unique
 to
health
 care.
 They
 also
 exist
 for
 other
 publicly
 provided
 private
 goods
 such
 as
 education,
 social
 services
 and
 garbage
 collection.
For
 this
 reason,
 they
 have
 been
 the
 focus
 of
 considerable
 theoretical
 analysis
 and,
 increasingly,
 empirical
 investigation
 (e.g.,
Cohen-Zada
 and
 Justman,
 2003;
 Bearse
 et
 al.,
 2013).
 The
 standard
 theoretical
 political
 economy
 models
 (e.g.,
 Stiglitz,
 1974;
Epple
 and
 Romano,
 1996a,b;
 Gouveia,
 1997;
 Glomm
 and
 Ravikumar,
 1998)
 focus
 on
 only
 two
 types
 of
 private
 ﬁnance
 options
noted
 above—top-up
 and
 opt-out—both
 of
 which
 require
 individuals
 to
 continue
 to
 ﬁnance
 public
 provision
 of
 the
 good
even
 while
 privately
 topping
 up
 or
 opting
 out.
 More
 recently,
 Myers
 and
 Lülfesmann
 (2009)
 consider
 the
 case
 in
 which
 any
household,
 regardless
 of
 income,
 can
 choose
 to
 exit
 the
 public
 system.
 Such
 an
 option
 can
 be
 characterized
 as
 universal-exit.
Such
 theoretical
 models
 provide
 valuable
 insight
 into
 outcomes
 under
 mixed
 systems
 of
 ﬁnance,
 but
 given
 the
 controversy
regarding
 mixed
 public
 and
 private
 ﬁnance
 in
 sectors
 such
 as
 health
 care,
 it
 is
 important
 to
 empirically
 test
 the
 predictions
of
 these
 models.
In
 this
 paper,
 we
 modify
 the
 political
 economy
 models
 of
 mixed
 ﬁnancing
 of
 private
 goods
 to
 allow
 for
 either
 a
 universal-
exit
 option
 or
 a
 conditional-exit
 option
 and
 use
 controlled
 laboratory
 experiments
 to
 empirically
 investigate
 the
 predictions
of
 these
 two
 exit
 models.
 Our
 objectives
 are
 to
 test
 the
 predictions
 of
 these
 political
 economy
 models
 in
 a
 controlled
 laboratory
environment,
 including
 both
 non-health
 and
 health
 frames
 and,
 based
 on
 the
 observed
 outcomes,
 draw
 implications
 for
mixed
 systems
 of
 health
 care
 ﬁnance.
In
 the
 standard
 top-up
 and
 opt-out
 models,
 uniform
 public
 provision
 of
 a
 private
 good
 is
 ﬁnanced
 with
 a
 proportional
income
 tax.
 Individuals
 ﬁrst
 vote
 on
 the
 proportional
 tax
 rate,
 which
 establishes
 the
 level
 of
 public
 provision
 of
 the
 good,
and
 then
 decide
 whether
 and
 how
 much
 of
 the
 good
 to
 purchase
 privately
 in
 addition
 to,
 or
 in
 place
 of,
 the
 public
 provision.
Regardless
 of
 their
 private
 purchases
 decision,
 individuals
 continue
 to
 ﬁnance
 public
 provision.
 Buckley
 et
 al.
 (2015)
 inves-
tigate
 the
 behavioral
 predictions
 of
 such
 top-up
 and
 opt-out
 models.
 This
 paper
 extends
 this
 previous
 work
 to
 consider
 an
environment
 in
 which
 individuals
 can
 exit
 the
 public
 system,
 withdrawing
 their
 ﬁnancial
 contributions
 while
 obtaining
 the
good
 privately.
 Allowing
 for
 a
 universal-exit
 option
 is
 predicted
 to
 result
 in
 a
 complete
 unraveling
 of
 the
 public
 system
 as
all
 individuals,
 save
 the
 lowest
 income
 individual,
 will
 have
 incentive
 to
 exit.
 Under
 conditional-exit,
 which
 limits
 the
 exit
option
 to
 high-income
 individuals
 only,
 those
 with
 high
 incomes
 are
 predicted
 to
 exit
 and
 consequently
 the
 per-capita
 level
of
 public
 provision
 will
 be
 below
 that
 provided
 in
 the
 absence
 of
 an
 exit
 option.
To
 test
 these
 theoretical
 predictions
 of
 mixed
 systems
 of
 ﬁnance
 with
 exit
 options,
 we  use
 controlled
 laboratory
 exper-
iments.
 Laboratory
 experiments
 are
 well
 suited
 for
 empirically
 testing
 predictions
 of
 such
 models,
 and
 are
 especially
important
 given
 that
 observational
 data
 are
 often
 either
 not
 available
 or
 are
 ill-suited
 for
 such
 testing.
 While
 our
 base-
line
 experiment
 uses
 a
 neutral
 investment
 decision-making
 context,
 we
 also
 provide
 a
 sensitivity
 analysis
 comparing
 these
experimental
 results
 to
 sessions
 run
 with
 an
 explicit
 health
 care
 frame.1 Our
 experiments
 include
 three
 ﬁnancing
 conﬁgura-
tions:
 public-ﬁnance-only,
 mixed
 ﬁnancing
 with
 universal-exit,
 and
 mixed
 ﬁnancing
 with
 conditional-exit.
 The
 design
 uses
a
 combination
 of
 within-subject
 and
 between-subject
 designs.
 All
 subjects
 experience
 a
 baseline
 treatment
 of
 10
 periods
of
 a
 public-only
 ﬁnancing
 system,
 followed
 by
 10
 periods
 in
 one
 of
 the
 two
 mixed
 systems
 with
 exit
 (universal-exit
 or
conditional-exit).
 Comparison
 of
 the
 baseline
 public-ﬁnance-only
 scheme
 and
 each
 of
 the
 two
 mixed
 ﬁnancing
 schemes
relies
 on
 within-subject
 variation,
 while
 the
 comparison
 of
 the
 two
 mixed
 ﬁnancing
 schemes
 relies
 on
 between-subject
variation.
 Any
 ordering/persistence
 effect
 is
 addressed
 by
 reversing
 the
 ordering
 of
 the
 public-only
 and
 mixed
 ﬁnancing
(with
 exit)
 treatment
 pairings
 so
 that
 half
 the
 subjects
 experience
 the
 mixed
 ﬁnancing
 system
 ﬁrst,
 followed
 by
 the
 public-
ﬁnance-only
 treatment.
 In
 each
 decision
 period
 of
 all
 treatments
 individuals
 are
 assigned
 an
 exogenous
 income.
 In
 the
public-only
 treatment
 individuals
 must
 choose
 their
 preferred
 proportional
 income
 tax
 rate.
 In
 the
 exit
 treatments
 individ-
uals
 who
 are
 permitted
 to
 exit
 must
 choose
 whether
 to
 exit.
 If
 they
 choose
 to
 exit,
 they
 then
 have
 to
 choose
 the
 amount
 of
the
 private
 good
 they
 will
 consume.
 All
 individuals
 who
 do
 not
 exit
 (either
 by
 choice
 or
 design)
 must
 choose
 their
 preferred
proportional
 income
 tax
 rates.
 The
 proportional
 tax
 rate
 used
 to
 ﬁnance
 the
 public
 provision
 of
 the
 private
 good
 is
 deter-
mined
 by
 the
 median
 tax
 rate
 among
 the
 preferred
 rates
 submitted
 by
 the
 participants
 in
 a
 laboratory
 session.
 This
 captures
the
 outcome
 of
 commonplace
 majority-rule
 voting
 due
 to
 the
 median
 voter
 theorem,
 which
 states
 that
 when
 individuals
have
 single-peaked
 preferences
 a
 majority-rule
 voting
 system
 will
 result
 in
 the
 outcome
 most
 preferred
 by
 the
 median
 voter
(Black,
 1948).
The
 experimental
 results
 reveal
 some
 noteworthy
 differences
 in
 behavior
 under
 the
 different
 exit
 options.
 First,
 we  ﬁnd
that
 in
 the
 conditional-exit
 treatment
 both
 the
 exit
 behavior
 of
 high-income
 individuals
 and
 the
 tax
 rates
 selected
 by
 those
1 Ahlert
 et
 al.
 (2012)
 and
 Kesternich
 et
 al.
 (2015)
 also
 investigate
 health
 versus
 neutral
 framing
 of
 experiments,
 although
 neither
 study
 focuses
 on
 health
care
 ﬁnance.

who
 remain
 in
 the
 public
 system
 are
 consistent
 with
 the
 theoretical
 predictions.
 In
 the
 universal-exit
 treatment,
 however,
high-income
 individuals
 are
 less
 likely
 to
 exit
 than
 predicted
 by
 theory
 and
 consequently,
 more
 people
 contribute
 to
 public
provision
 of
 the
 private
 good
 than
 is
 predicted.
 Even
 though
 the
 incentives
 for
 high-income
 individuals
 to
 exit
 are
 identical
under
 both
 the
 universal
 and
 income-conditional
 schemes,
 high-income
 individuals
 are
 less
 likely
 to
 exit
 when
 the
 exit
option
 is
 universal.
 Making
 exit
 conditional
 on
 high-income
 appears
 to
 give
 the
 high-income
 individuals
 “permission”
 to
 exit.
Attempts
 to
 identify
 the
 source
 of
 differences
 in
 behavior
 by
 high-income
 individuals
 under
 the
 two
 schemes
 suggest
 that
 a
number
 of
 factors
 may
 be
 at
 play
 including
 learning
 effects
 and
 a
 type
 of
 priming
 effect,
 but
 other-regarding
 preferences
 do
not
 appear
 to
 be
 an
 important
 factor.
 Also,
 tax-
 and
 exit-rate
 decisions
 are
 found
 to
 be
 more
 consistent
 with
 the
 theoretical
predictions
 when
 the
 decision-making
 environment
 is
 framed
 in
 terms
 of
 health
 care
 rather
 than
 a
 neutral
 investment
decision.
In
 the
 next

 we
 outline
 our
 theoretical
 framework.

 the

 of
the

 framework
We  develop
 a
 simple
 discrete
 version
 of
 a
 commonly
 used
 majority-rule
 voting
 model
 of
 tax-ﬁnanced
 public
 provision
 of
a
 private
 good
 (see
 e.g.,
 Glomm
 et
 al.,
 2011)
 that
 allows
 for
 an
 exit
 option.2 There
 are
 N
 individuals
 or
 households
 who
 differ
 in
their
 ﬁxed
 income
 (or
 endowment
 of
 a
 numeraire
 consumption
 good)
 denoted
 by
 y.
 The
 mean
 income
 in
 the
 population
 is
 y,
the
 median
 income,
 ym,
 and
 the
 median
 is
 assumed
 to
 be
 less
 than
 the
 mean.
 Households
 have
 preferences
 over
 consumption
of
 a
 numeraire
 good,
 given
 by
 c,
 and
 of
 a
 speciﬁc
 private
 good
 that
 may
 be
 publicly
 provided
 or
 purchased
 privately,
 given
by
 H.
 Household
 preferences
 are
 represented
 by
 the
 following
 utility
 function3:
U(c,
 H)
 =
 ac +
 bH
(1)
where
 a,
 b
 >
 0
 and
 
 ∈
 (0,
 1).
 The
 private
 good
 H
 is
 produced
 using
 the
 numeraire
 good.
 Following
 the
 literature,
 it
 takes
 one
unit
 of
 the
 numeraire
 good
 to
 produce
 one
 unit
 of
 H
 independent
 of
 whether
 H
 is
 publicly
 or
 privately
 ﬁnanced.
Consider
 ﬁrst
 the
 decision
 of
 a
 household
 who
 chooses
 to
 exit
 the
 public
 system.
 Because
 the
 household
 is
 not
 ﬁnancing
the
 public
 provision
 of
 the
 private
 good
 and
 is
 ﬁnancing
 its
 own
 consumption
 of
 the
 private
 good,
 the
 household
 maximizes
(1)
 subject
 to
 the
 following
 budget
 constraint4
c
 +
 h
 =
 y
 
(2)
where
 h
 denotes
 the
 amount
 of
 H
 purchased
 privately.
 This
 problem
 yields
 the
 household’s
 optimal
 demand
 for
 the
 private
good
h(y)
 =
y

 +
 1
(3)
where
 
 = 
a/b(1/1−) >
 0
 and
 h′(y)
 >
 0.
Theoretical
 Prediction
 1.
 
For
 households
 that
 choose
 to
 exit
 the
 public
 system,
 their
 optimal
 purchases
 of
 the
 private
 good
will
 be
 given
 by
 (3)
 and
 will
 be
 increasing
 in
 their
 income.
Next
 we
 characterize
 the
 public
 system
 and
 exit
 behavior
 in
 each
 of
 the
 three
 treatments
 we
 consider:
 public
 ﬁnance
only,
 mixed
 ﬁnancing
 with
 a
 universal-exit
 option,
 and
 mixed
 ﬁnancing
 with
 a
 conditional-exit
 option.
2.1.
 Public
 ﬁnance
 only
In
 a
 public-only
 ﬁnance
 system,
 the
 provision
 of
 H
 is
 ﬁnanced
 solely
 through
 a
 proportional
 income
 tax,
 denoted
 by
 t
which
 is
 determined
 by
 majority-rule.
 The
 government
 provides
 a
 uniform
 amount
 of
 the
 private
 good,
 denoted
 by
 gH,
 to
each
 household.
 The
 government’s
 budget
 constraint
 is
ty
 =
 gH.
 
(4)
Using
 the
 government’s
 budget
 constraint
 (4),
 the
 household’s
 budget
 constraint
 can
 be
 written
 as
c
 =
 y
 −
 y
y

gH
(5)
where
 T(y)
 =
 y/y
 is
 the
 household’s
 relative
 tax
 price
 for
 the
 private
 good.
2 These
 standard
 political
 economy
 models
 typically
 assume
 a
 continuous
 population
 distribution
 and
 general
 individual
 preferences.
 To
 implement
 the
theoretical
 environment
 in
 a
 laboratory
 setting
 we
 adopt
 a
 discrete
 income
 distribution
 and
 a
 speciﬁc
 utility
 function
 to
 obtain
 closed-form
 solutions.
3 The
 speciﬁc
 utility
 function
 and
 the
 assumed
 parameter
 values
 we  use
 are
 based
 on
 Buckley
 et
 al.
 (2015).
4 The
 household’s
 problem
 is
 well-behaved.

Substituting
 the
 household’s
 budget
 constraint
 (5)
 into
 (1)
 with
 H
 =
 gH,
 yields
 the
 household’s
 induced
 utility
 function
over
 the
 public
 provision
 of
 the
 private
 good
V(g)
 ≡
 max
gH≥0
a(y
 −
 T(y)gH) +
 bg
H
(6)
which
 is
 strictly
 concave
 in
 gH.
 Therefore,
 each
 household
 has
 a
 unique
 preferred
 level
 of
 public
 provision,
 denoted
 by
 gH(y),
and
 a
 unique
 preferred
 tax
 rate,
 denoted
 by
 t(y),
 which
 are
 both
 strictly
 decreasing
 in
 household
 income.
 It
 follows
 directly
from
 the
 median
 voter
 theorem
 that
 the
 equilibrium
 outcome
 under
 majority
 rule
 will
 be
 given
 by
 the
 preferred
 tax
 rate
 of
the
 median
 income
 household
t(ym)
 =
1
T(ym)(/1−) +
 1
.
 
(7)
The
 amount
 of
 public
 provision
 in
 equilibrium
 will
 be
gH(ym)
 =
ym
T(ym)(1/1−) +
 T(ym)
.

Theoretical
 Prediction
 2.
 
In
 a
 public-only
 ﬁnancing
 system,
 preferred
 tax
 rates
 are
 strictly
 decreasing
 in
 income
 and
 the
equilibrium
 outcome
 with
 majority-rule
 will
 be
 determined
 by
 the
 preferred
 tax
 rate
 of
 the
 median-income
 household.
In
 a
 public-only
 ﬁnancing
 system,
 all
 households
 receive
 the
 same
 amount
 of
 H,
 but
 face
 different
 relative
 tax
 prices
 for
the
 private
 good
 that
 are
 increasing
 in
 income.
 The
 household
 with
 the
 mean
 income
 faces
 the
 same
 price
 for
 the
 private
good
 whether
 the
 good
 is
 ﬁnanced
 publicly
 or
 privately.
 Consequently,
 public
 provision
 of
 the
 good
 effectively
 redistributes
resources
 from
 households
 with
 incomes
 above
 the
 mean
 (who
 face
 higher
 relative
 tax
 prices)
 to
 households
 with
 incomes
below
 the
 mean
 (who
 face
 lower
 relative
 tax
 prices).
Now
 consider
 what
 happens
 to
 the
 public
 provision
 of
 the
 private
 good
 when
 households
 can
 choose
 to
 not
 pay
 taxes
 to
ﬁnance
 the
 public
 provision
 of
 H,
 and
 instead
 purchase
 H
 privately.
 We  consider
 two
 cases:
 universal-exit
 and
 conditional-
exit.
2.2.
 Mixed
 ﬁnancing:
 universal-exit
 option
Consider
 ﬁrst
 the
 universal-exit
 option
 in
 which
 all
 households
 can
 choose
 to
 exit.
 A
 household
 who
 exits
 the
 public
system
 pays
 no
 taxes
 to
 support
 public
 provision
 and
 has
 its
 full
 income
 available
 when
 choosing
 how
 much
 of
 H
 to
 purchase
privately.
 The
 timing
 of
 this
 treatment
 is
 as
 follows:
1.
 Households
 decide
 whether
 to
 exit
 the
 public
 system.
 Households
 who
 choose
 not
 to
 exit
 the
 public
 system
 vote
 on
 the
level
 of
 public
 provision,
 i.e.,
 vote
 on
 the
 proportional
 income
 tax
 to
 be
 applied
 to
 all
 those
 households
 who
 remain
 in
 the
public
 system.
 The
 voting
 outcome
 is
 determined
 by
 majority
 rule.
2.
 Households
 who
 exit
 choose
 how
 much
 H
 to
 purchase
 privately.
Only
 households
 who
 have
 chosen
 to
 remain
 in
 the
 public
 system
 are
 allowed
 to
 vote
 for
 the
 public
 tax
 rate.5 Since
 households
who
 exit
 do
 not
 pay
 any
 taxes,
 they
 should
 be
 indifferent
 across
 all
 possible
 tax
 rates.
 Allowing
 these
 households
 to
 vote
on
 the
 tax
 rate
 could
 result
 in
 a
 situation
 in
 which
 a
 majority-preferred
 tax
 rate
 does
 not
 reﬂect
 the
 preferences
 of
 the
households
 that
 remain
 in
 the
 public
 system,
 to
 which
 the
 tax
 rate
 applies.
 Second,
 households
 vote
 on
 the
 tax
 rate
 before
knowing
 which
 households
 have
 exited;
 that
 is,
 households
 play
 a
 simultaneous-move
 game.
Public
 provision
 redistributes
 income
 from
 high-
 to
 low-income
 households.
 Therefore,
 the
 highest-income
 household
is
 worse
 off
 in
 a
 public
 system
 than
 in
 a
 private-ﬁnance
 only
 system.
 Hence,
 the
 highest-income
 household
 has
 a
 strictly
dominant
 strategy
 to
 exit.
 Consider
 the
 next
 highest
 income
 household.
 Recognizing
 that
 the
 highest-income
 household
 will
exit,
 this
 household
 now
 also
 has
 a
 strictly
 dominant
 strategy
 to
 exit
 the
 public
 system.
 By
 the
 continued
 iterated
 deletion
 of
strictly
 dominated
 strategies,
 all
 households,
 except
 the
 household
 with
 the
 lowest
 income
 (denoted
 by
 ymin),
 will
 choose
 to
exit
 the
 public
 system.
 The
 lowest-income
 household
 will
 be
 indifferent
 between
 exiting
 or
 not
 since
 a
 public
 system
 with
only
 one
 household
 is
 equivalent
 to
 a
 private-ﬁnance
 only
 system.
 The
 amount
 of
 private
 good
 consumed
 by
 each
 household
will
 be
 given
 by
 (3).
 Allowing
 for
 universal-exit
 is
 predicted
 to
 result
 in
 a
 system
 of
 private-ﬁnance
 only.
Theoretical
 Prediction
 3.
 
In
 a
 mixed
 ﬁnancing
 system
 with
 an
 universal-exit
 option,
 all
 households
 will
 choose
 to
 exit
except
 the
 lowest-income
 household,
 who
 will
 be
 indifferent
 between
 exiting
 and
 not
 exiting.
5 An
 example
 of
 a
 situation
 in
 which
 those
 who
 exit
 are
 removed
 from
 voting
 is
 provided
 by
 the
 Canada
 Elections
 Act,
 which
 currently
 prohibits
 Canadian
citizens
 who
 have
 lived
 abroad
 for
 more
 than
 5
 years
 from
 participating
 in
 Canadian
 federal
 elections.

2.3.
 Mixed
 ﬁnancing:
 conditional-exit
 option
Consider
 a
 conditional-exit
 option
 that
 allows
 a
 household
 to
 exit
 the
 public
 system
 only
 if
 the
 household’s
 income
 is
above
 a
 speciﬁed
 income
 threshold.
 The
 timing
 of
 the
 exit
 decision
 is
 the
 same
 as
 in
 the
 universal-exit
 treatment,
 but
 only
those
 with
 incomes
 above
 the
 threshold
 can
 choose
 to
 exit.
 It
 is
 straightforward
 to
 see
 that
 again
 by
 iterated
 deletion
 of
dominated
 strategies
 all
 households
 with
 incomes
 at
 or
 above
 the
 threshold
 will
 optimally
 exit.
 The
 public
 system
 will
consist
 of
 all
 households
 with
 incomes
 below
 the
 threshold
 income
 level,
 denoted
 by ˆ
N <
 N,
 and
 the
 analysis
 of
 this
 public
system
 is
 the
 same
 as
 the
 one
 described
 in
 Section
 2.1
 with
 N
 replaced
 by ˆ
N.
 Again,
 privately
 purchased
 amounts
 of
 H
 by
those
 who
 exit
 the
 public
 system
 are
 given
 by
 (3).
Theoretical
 Prediction
 4.
 
In
 a
 mixed
 ﬁnancing
 system
 with
 an
 income-conditioned
 exit
 option,
 all
 those
 households
with
 income
 above
 the
 income
 threshold
 will
 exit
 the
 public
 system.
 The
 equilibrium
 tax
 rate
 in
 the
 public
 system
 will
 be
determined
 by
 the
 preferred
 tax
 rate
 of
 the
 household
 with
 the
 median
 income
 among
 those
 households
 remaining
 in
 the
public
 system.
In
 summary,
 under
 public-only
 ﬁnance
 all
 individuals
 will
 be
 in
 the
 public
 system,
 under
 universal-exit
 there
 is
 predicted
to
 be
 only
 private
 provision
 and
 under
 conditional-exit
 high-income
 individuals
 are
 predicted
 to
 be
 in
 the
 private
 system
and
 low-income
 individuals
 are
 predicted
 to
 be
 in
 the
 public
 system.
 Thus,
 the
 alternative
 systems
 of
 ﬁnance
 considered
are
 expected
 to
 give
 rise
 to
 differing
 demands
 for
 H.
 In
 Section
 5,
 we
 discuss
 the
 predicted
 total
 demand
 for
 H
 under
 the
different
 ﬁnancing
 systems
 given
 the
 speciﬁc
 parameter
 values
 we  implement
 in
 the
 experiment.6
3.
 Laboratory
 implementation
We  use
 a
 controlled
 laboratory
 experiment
 to
 test
 the
 above
 theoretical
 predictions
 regarding
 the
 equilibrium
 outcomes
of
 majority-rule
 voting
 over
 the
 tax-ﬁnanced
 public
 provision
 of
 a
 private
 good
 under
 public-only
 ﬁnancing
 and
 mixed
ﬁnancing
 with
 either
 a
 universal-exit
 option
 or
 with
 a
 conditional-exit
 option.
 Following
 standard
 experimental
 economic
methodology,
 household
 or
 individual
 decision-makers,
 i.e.,
 subjects,
 in
 the
 experiment
 are
 incentivized
 with
 real
 monetary
payoffs.
 The
 main
 experiment
 is
 framed
 in
 an
 investment
 context
 to
 reﬂect
 the
 neutral
 consumption
 setting
 of
 the
 theoretical
models
 of
 public
 provision
 of
 private
 goods
 and
 a
 context
 that
 is
 commonly
 used
 in
 the
 experimental
 economics
 literature
(Alm
 and
 Jacobson,
 2007).
 Subject
 decisions
 are
 framed
 as
 choices
 over
 how
 much
 to
 invest
 in
 alternative
 investment
 funds,
including
 a
 collective
 group
 fund
 and
 an
 individual
 private
 fund.
 We  recognize
 that
 a
 decision
 made
 between
 an
 individual
fund
 and
 a
 group
 fund
 is
 not
 strictly
 neutral
 (Dufwenberg
 et
 al.,
 2011),
 but
 this
 terminology
 is
 used
 to
 facilitate
 subject
comprehension
 of
 the
 decision-making
 environment.
 The
 impact
 of
 a
 neutral
 investment
 frame
 rather
 than
 a
 health
 care
frame
 is
 tested
 by
 comparing
 results
 from
 the
 neutral
 investment
 frame
 sessions
 with
 results
 from
 sessions
 that
 use
 an
explicit
 health
 care
 frame.
 This
 sensitivity
 analysis
 is
 presented
 in
 Section
 6
 below.
 The
 complete
 set
 of
 instructions
 used
 in
the
 experiment
 can
 be
 found
 in
 the
 Appendix.
Each
 session
 was
 run
 with
 10
 subjects
 who
 were
 told
 that
 they
 would
 be
 randomly
 assigned
 to
 be
 a
 member
 of
 a
 group
 of
ﬁve
 people,
 but
 were
 not
 told
 who
 was
 in
 their
 group.
 Each
 group
 remained
 together
 through
 the
 session
 (following
 Buckley
et
 al.,
 2015;
 Kroll
 et
 al.,
 2007;
 Margreiter
 et
 al.,
 2005)
 so
 that
 the
 two
 groups
 in
 each
 session
 represented
 independent
observations.
 Subjects
 were
 told
 that,
 at
 the
 beginning
 of
 each
 decision
 period,
 each
 member
 of
 their
 group
 would
 randomly
be
 assigned
 an
 income,
 expressed
 in
 laboratory
 dollars
 (L$),
 from
 the
 following
 set
 of
 ﬁve
 income
 levels
 (125,
 275,
 640,
700,
 1500),
 and
 that
 each
 individual
 would
 be
 assigned
 each
 of
 the
 income
 levels
 twice
 over
 the
 course
 of
 the
 10
 periods
of
 the
 treatment.
 The
 income
 distribution
 was
 chosen
 to
 ensure
 that
 the
 median
 income
 was
 below
 the
 mean
 (consistent
with
 the
 theoretical
 assumption).7 To
 keep
 subjects
 actively
 thinking
 about
 their
 decisions,
 incomes
 were
 assigned
 in
 a
pre-determined
 pseudo-random
 order
 such
 that
 in
 each
 treatment
 subjects
 experienced
 each
 of
 the
 ﬁve
 income
 levels
 in
the
 ﬁrst
 ﬁve
 periods
 and
 then
 again
 in
 the
 last
 ﬁve
 periods,
 but
 in
 a
 different
 order.
 The
 effect
 of
 randomizing
 incomes
 is
tested
 below
 in
 Section
 5,
 which
 presents
 results
 from
 sessions
 in
 which
 each
 subject’s
 income
 was
 held
 ﬁxed
 over
 the
 entire
session.
As
 noted
 earlier,
 the
 experiment
 used
 a
 combination
 of
 within-subject
 and
 between-subject
 designs.
 All
 subjects
 expe-
rienced
 10
 decision
 periods
 of
 a
 public-only
 ﬁnancing
 treatment
 and
 10
 decision
 periods
 of
 one
 of
 the
 two
 mixed
 ﬁnancing
systems,
 where
 the
 order
 of
 the
 two
 treatments
 (public/mixed)
 was
 randomized
 across
 experimental
 sessions
 to
 control
 for
potential
 order
 effects.
 Comparison
 of
 the
 baseline
 public-only
 ﬁnancing
 system
 and
 the
 two
 mixed
 ﬁnancing
 systems
 relies
on
 within-subject
 variation,
 while
 the
 comparison
 of
 the
 two
 mixed
 ﬁnancing
 systems
 (universal-exit
 and
 conditional-exit)
relies
 on
 between-subject
 variation.
At
 the
 beginning
 of
 each
 decision
 period
 of
 the
 public-only
 ﬁnance
 treatment,
 subjects
 were
 told
 that
 their
 income
 must
be
 divided
 between
 two
 Investment
 Funds:
 a
 Group
 Investment
 Fund
 (GIF)
 and
 a
 Private
 Investment
 Fund
 (PIF).
 Subjects
6 Following
 the
 literature
 we  assume
 that
 provision
 of
 H
 is
 subject
 to
 constant
 marginal
 costs.
 This
 assumption
 could
 be
 relaxed
 to
 incorporate
 increasing
marginal
 costs
 provided
 that
 preferences
 remain
 single-peaked
 in
 public
 provision
 and
 preferred
 public
 provision
 is
 decreasing
 in
 income.
 Total
 demand
for
 H
 under
 the
 different
 ﬁnancing
 systems
 would
 then
 be
 affected
 by
 the
 assumed
 underlying
 cost
 function.
7 This
 distribution
 of
 income
 is
 roughly
 representative
 of
 the
 incomes
 at
 the
 10th,
 30th,
 50th,
 70th
 and
 90th
 percentiles
 in
 Canada
 in
 2013.

were
 told
 that
 everyone
 in
 their
 group
 must
 contribute
 the
 same
 ﬁxed
 percentage
 of
 their
 income
 to
 the
 GIF
 and
 that
 this
percentage
 would
 be
 determined
 by
 the
 group.
 The
 total
 amount
 contributed
 to
 the
 GIF
 would
 be
 divided
 into
 ﬁve
 equal
shares.
 Each
 share
 would
 be
 invested
 in
 Market
 A
 and
 the
 subject
 would
 earn
 a
 return
 from
 this
 investment.
 The
 subject’s
remaining
 income
 after
 contributing
 to
 the
 GIF
 would
 go
 into
 the
 subject’s
 PIF
 and
 be
 invested
 in
 Market
 B
 where
 it
 would
earn
 a
 return
 for
 the
 subject.
 The
 returns
 earned
 on
 the
 investments
 were
 calculated
 using
 the
 payoff
 function
 given
 by
 (1),
where
 the
 GIF
 investment
 in
 Market
 A
 is
 for
 the
 private
 good
 H
 and
 the
 PIF
 investment
 in
 Market
 B
 is
 for
 the
 numeraire
 good
c
 with
 the
 following
 parameter
 values:
 a
 =
 20,
 b
 =
 22
 and
 
 =
 0.6.8
In
 each
 of
 the
 decision
 periods
 of
 the
 public-only
 treatment,
 subjects
 were
 asked
 to
 submit
 their
 preferred
 mandatory
 GIF
contribution
 rate.
 To
 replicate
 the
 outcome
 of
 majority-rule
 voting
 in
 a
 laboratory
 environment,
 subjects
 were
 told
 that
 the
submitted
 GIF
 contribution
 rates
 would
 be
 ranked
 from
 highest
 to
 lowest
 and
 that
 the
 median
 contribution
 rate
 would
 be
implemented.9 It
 was
 explained
 to
 them
 why
 there
 was
 no
 incentive
 to
 submit
 a
 contribution
 rate
 other
 than
 their
 preferred
rate.
 Subjects
 were
 provided
 with
 tables
 and
 tutorial
 examples
 to
 illustrate
 how
 the
 returns
 worked
 in
 the
 markets
 and
 an
onscreen
 calculator
 that
 allowed
 them
 to
 determine
 their
 returns
 in
 both
 markets
 as
 well
 as
 their
 total
 return
 for
 different
income
 levels
 and
 different
 GIF
 contribution
 rates.
 Subjects
 were
 able
 to
 access
 the
 calculator
 throughout
 the
 session.
In
 the
 universal-exit
 treatment,
 subjects
 were
 provided
 the
 same
 information
 as
 in
 the
 public-only
 treatment
 as
 described
above,
 but
 were
 also
 told
 that
 they
 could
 decide
 whether
 or
 not
 to
 participate
 in
 the
 group
 investment
 fund.
 Subjects
 were
told
 that
 if
 they
 choose
 not
 to
 participate
 in
 the
 GIF,
 then
 they
 would
 not
 make
 any
 contribution
 to
 the
 GIF
 and
 would
not
 receive
 any
 share
 of
 the
 GIF.
 The
 subjects
 would,
 however,
 be
 able
 to
 choose
 how
 much
 of
 their
 income
 to
 invest
 in
 a
different
 market,
 Market
 C,
 where
 the
 returns
 to
 investment
 in
 Market
 C
 are
 the
 same
 as
 in
 Market
 A.
 Whatever
 amount
not
 invested
 in
 Market
 C,
 would
 then
 be
 automatically
 invested
 in
 Market
 B
 on
 behalf
 of
 the
 subject.
 The
 subjects’
 total
returns
 for
 each
 period
 if
 they
 choose
 not
 to
 participate
 in
 the
 GIF
 is
 the
 sum
 of
 the
 returns
 of
 their
 investments
 in
 Markets
B
 and
 C.
 Subjects
 were
 told
 that
 if
 they
 choose
 not
 to
 exit,
 everyone
 who
 remained
 in
 the
 GIF
 would
 be
 asked
 to
 submit
 their
preferred
 GIF
 contribution
 rates.
 The
 submitted
 GIF
 contribution
 rates
 would
 be
 ranked
 from
 highest
 to
 lowest.
 In
 the
 case
of
 an
 odd
 number
 of
 subjects
 remaining
 in
 the
 GIF,
 the
 middle-ranked
 contribution
 rate
 would
 be
 implemented.
 In
 the
 case
of
 an
 even
 number
 of
 subjects
 remaining
 in
 the
 GIF
 one
 of
 the
 two
 middle-ranked
 submitted
 GIF
 rates
 would
 be
 randomly
chosen
 and
 implemented.
The
 conditional-exit
 treatment
 was
 described
 similarly
 to
 the
 universal-exit
 treatment
 except
 only
 subjects
 with
 the
 two
highest
 income
 levels
 (700,
 1500)
 were
 given
 the
 choice
 of
 participating
 in
 or
 exiting
 from
 the
 GIF.
 Subjects
 with
 incomes
 of
125,
 275
 and
 640
 automatically
 remained
 in
 the
 GIF.
 At
 the
 end
 of
 each
 of
 the
 10
 periods
 of
 both
 exit
 treatments,
 all
 subjects
were
 told
 the
 total
 number
 of
 subjects
 who
 participated
 in
 the
 GIF,
 the
 implemented
 GIF
 contribution
 rate,
 the
 total
 amount
contributed
 to
 the
 GIF,
 their
 own
 investments
 and
 returns
 in
 Markets
 A
 and
 B
 (if
 the
 subjects
 participated
 in
 the
 GIF)
 or
 in
Markets
 C
 and
 B
 (if
 the
 subjects
 did
 not
 participate
 in
 the
 GIF)
 and
 ﬁnally
 their
 own
 total
 returns
 for
 the
 period.
In
 both
 exit
 treatments,
 each
 subject
 was
 provided
 with
 examples
 to
 illustrate
 how
 her
 returns
 were
 determined
 depend-
ing
 on
 which
 subjects
 participated
 in
 the
 GIF,
 including
 the
 cases
 when
 all
 subjects
 participated
 in
 the
 GIF,
 the
 subject
remained
 in
 the
 GIF
 but
 other
 subjects
 exited,
 and
 when
 the
 subject
 herself
 exited
 the
 GIF.
 Subjects
 were
 also
 given
 a
 tutorial
in
 the
 use
 of
 an
 onscreen
 calculator
 that
 allowed
 them
 to
 determine
 their
 total
 returns
 for
 different
 income
 levels,
 GIF
 con-
tribution
 rates,
 and
 different
 exit
 decisions
 made
 by
 themselves
 and
 others.
 Subjects
 were
 given
 a
 few
 minutes
 to
 practice
using
 the
 calculator
 and
 were
 able
 to
 access
 the
 calculator
 whenever
 they
 were
 asked
 to
 make
 a
 decision.
All
 subjects
 were
 recruited
 using
 an
 online
 recruitment
 system
 for
 controlled
 laboratory
 experiments
 (ORSEE,
 Greiner,
2015)
 and
 the
 experiment
 was
 administered
 in
 the
 McMaster
 Experimental
 Economics
 Laboratory.
 Our
 main
 experimental
design
 involves
 ﬁve
 groups
 of
 ﬁve
 subjects
 each
 experiencing
 one
 of
 the
 following
 treatment
 pairs:
 public-only
 followed
by
 universal-exit,
 universal-exit
 followed
 by
 public-only,
 public-only
 followed
 by
 conditional-exit
 and
 conditional-exit
followed
 by
 public-only.
 Additional
 treatments
 were
 also
 run
 as
 part
 of
 a
 sensitivity
 analysis.
 Each
 session
 had
 20
 decision
periods
 (10
 decision
 periods
 for
 each
 treatment)
 and
 lasted
 approximately
 70
 min.10 The
 average
 subject
 payoff
 was
 $23
including
 a
 $5
 show-up
 fee.
 Subjects
 were
 individually
 paid
 their
 cash
 earnings
 in
 private.
 The
 experiment
 was
 conducted
using
 z-Tree
 software
 (Fischbacher,
 2007)
 and
 the
 laboratory
 protocol
 was
 approved
 by
 the
 McMaster
 University
 Research
Ethics
 Board.
 Table
 1
 summarizes
 the
 experimental
 design
 for
 all
 treatments
 presented
 below.

 Experimental
 results
We  begin
 by
 testing
 for
 learning
 effects
 between
 the
 ﬁrst
 ﬁve
 decision
 periods
 and
 the
 second
 ﬁve
 decision
 periods
of
 the
 main
 design
 presented
 in
 Table
 1
 with
 respect
 to
 the
 mean
 implemented
 GIF
 rate
 (hereafter
 referred
 to
 as
 the
 tax
8 These
 parameter
 values
 were
 chosen
 to
 assure
 the
 saliency
 of
 subject
 decisions
 in
 the
 experiment
 and
 are
 based
 on
 values
 used
 by
 Buckley
 et
 al.
 (2015).
9 Differing
 voting
 processes
 have
 been
 implemented
 experimentally.
 The
 seminal
 work
 by
 Fiorina
 and
 Plott
 (1978)
 uses
 a
 sequential
 amendment-driven
voting
 protocol
 while
 more
 recent
 papers
 use
 either
 simultaneous
 voting
 protocols
 (e.g.,
 Margreiter
 et
 al.,
 2005;
 Kroll
 et
 al.,
 2007)
 or
 a
 binary
 yes/no
 vote
on
 a
 given
 tax
 proposal
 (e.g.
 Sutter
 and
 Weck-Hannemann,
 2003).
 Another
 approach
 is
 to
 allow
 each
 individual
 to
 propose
 a
 tax
 rate
 and
 to
 implement
the
 median
 tax
 rate
 (e.g.
 Buckley
 et
 al.,
 2015;
 Norton
 and
 Isaac,
 2010).
 We  adopt
 the
 latter
 voting
 process
 since
 it
 most
 closely
 resembles
 the
 theoretical
environment
 that
 was
 being
 implemented
 in
 the
 lab.
10 All
 treatments
 used
 a
 repeated
 game
 design
 for
 the
 20
 periods,
 so
 decisions
 made
 in
 any
 one
 period
 did
 not
 have
 consequences
 for
 other
 periods.
 For
example,
 if
 a
 subject
 exited
 in
 period
 12,
 in
 period
 13
 they
 faced
 a
 new
 decision
 whether
 to
 exit.

 There
 is
 evidence
 of
 marginal
 learning
 effects
 with
 respect
 to
 the
 mean
 implemented
 GIF
 rate
 when
the
 universal-exit
 treatment
 was
 experienced
 ﬁrst.11 We
 next
 test
 for
 order
 effects
 to
 determine
 if
 there
 are
 any
 differences
in
 the
 mean
 implemented
 GIF
 rates,
 mean
 exit

 and
 mean
 private

 depending
 on
 whether
 the
 universal-
exit
 treatment
 or
 the
 conditional-exit
 treatment
 appears
 ﬁrst
 or
 second
 in
 the
 session.
 Our
 tests
 show
 no
 evidence
 of
 order
effects.12 For
 the
 analysis
 presented
 below
 we
 focus
 on
 the
 last
 ﬁve
 decision
 periods
 of
 each
 treatment
 to
 account
 for
 any
marginal
 learning
 effects.
We
 create
 an
 independent
 observation
 for
 each
 group
 of
 ﬁve
 subjects
 in
 each
 session
 of
 each
 treatment
 by
 computing
 the
mean
 value
 across
 the
 last
 ﬁve
 decision
 periods
 for
 each
 of
 the
 mean
 implemented
 tax
 rate,
 mean
 exit
 decisions
 and
 mean
private
 purchases.
 Because
 there
 are
 no
 order
 effects,
 this
 provides
 10
 independent
 observations
 of
 each
 variable
 for
 the
following
 treatments:
 public-only
 (paired
 with
 universal-exit),
 public-only
 (paired
 with
 conditional-exit),
 universal-exit
 and
conditional-exit.
 Any
 differences
 from
 null
 hypotheses
 are
 judged
 statistically
 signiﬁcant
 if
 the
 p-value
 is
 not
 greater
 than
the
 signiﬁcance
 level
 of
 0.10.
 All
 hypothesis
 tests
 are
 conducted
 using
 parametric
 paired
 or
 unpaired
 t-tests
 (as
 appropriate)
and
 non-parametric
 Mann–Whitney
 or
 Wilcoxon
 Signed-Ranks
 tests
 (as
 appropriate).
 We  only
 identify
 the
 speciﬁc
 tests
that
 are
 used
 if
 there
 is
 a
 difference
 between
 the
 results
 using
 parametric
 and
 non-parametric
 tests.
4.1.
 Exit
 decisions
Exit
 behavior
 differed
 substantially
 between
 the
 universal-exit
 and
 conditional-exit
 treatments
 as
 shown
 in
 Tables
 2
 and
 3.
The
 rates
 of
 exit
 in
 the
 universal-exit
 treatment
 were
 notably
 lower
 than
 predicted
 for
 all
 income
 levels,
 although,
 as
 expected,
they
 were
 increasing
 in
 income.
 In
 contrast,
 in
 the
 conditional-exit
 treatment
 although
 exit
 rates
 of
 0.940
 for
 individuals
with
 incomes
 of
 700
 and
 1500
 are
 statistically
 signiﬁcantly
 different
 from
 a
 rate
 of
 1.000,
 they
 are
 quite
 close
 to
 the
 predicted
value
 of
 1.0.
In
 the
 conditional-exit
 treatment
 individuals
 with
 the
 two
 highest
 incomes
 appear
 to
 have
 understood
 the
 beneﬁt
 to
them
 of
 exiting;
 in
 the
 universal-exit
 treatment,
 however,
 either
 they
 did
 not
 have
 this
 same
 degree
 of
 understanding
11 As
 the
 same
 subjects
 make
 decisions
 in
 both
 the
 ﬁrst-
 and
 second-half
 of
 each
 treatment,
 we
 use
 a
 non-parametric
 Wilcoxon
 Signed
 Rank
 test
 to
obtain
 ﬁve
 independent
 observations
 for
 each
 treatment.
 We  cannot
 reject
 the
 null
 hypotheses
 that
 there
 are
 no
 differences
 in
 the
 mean
 implemented
GIF
 rates,
 subjects’
 mean
 exit
 decisions
 or
 mean
 private
 purchases
 of
 those
 who
 choose
 to
 exit
 between
 the
 ﬁrst
 ﬁve
 and
 the
 last
 ﬁve
 periods
 of
 each
treatment
 when
 the
 public-ﬁnance-only
 treatment
 was
 seen
 ﬁrst.
 We  also
 conducted
 parametric
 paired
 t-tests
 and
 found
 similar
 results.
 Comparisons
between
 within-subject
 treatments
 reported
 in
 Subsections
 4.1–4.6
 below
 also
 use
 these
 same
 non-parametric
 and
 parametric
 signiﬁcance
 tests.
12 Because
 ordering
 of
 treatments
 was
 varied
 between
 subjects,
 the
 mean
 observations
 are
 independent;
 we
 therefore
 test
 for
 order
 effects
 using
both
 Mann–Whitney
 and
 Fisher–Pitman
 randomization
 nonparametric
 tests
 (Moir,
 1998).
 The
 p-values
 are

 above
 0.10
 and
 we
 cannot
 reject
 the
 null
hypotheses
 of
 no
 differences
 in
 these
 mean
 outcomes
 across
 the
 three
 treatments.
 These
 results
 are
 also
 supported
 by

or,
 if
 they
 did,
 they
 chose
 not

 act
 on
 it,
 because
 individuals
 with
 incomes
 of
 700
 and
 1500
 had
 exit
 rates
 of
 0.720
 and
0.760,
 respectively.
 Further,
 given
 that
 higher-income
 individuals
 did
 not
 exit
 as
 expected,
 lower-income
 individuals
 had
 an
incentive
 to
 remain
 in
 the
 public
 system
 because
 they
 receive
 income
 transfers
 from
 the
 higher-income
 individuals
 through
the
 public
 provision
 of
 the
 private
 good.
 Hence,
 their
 exit
 rates
 are
 low
 and
 the
 public
 system
 does
 not
 unravel
 as
 predicted
for
 the
 universal-exit
 treatment.
Result

Participants
 in
 the
 conditional-exit
 treatment
 exited
 as
 predicted
 but
 participants
 in
 the
 universal-exit

exited
 less
 often
 than
 predicted,
 with
 higher-income
 individuals
 exiting
 more
 frequently
 than
 lower-income
 individuals.
4.2.
 Private-purchase
 decisions
As
 also
 shown
 in
 Tables
 2
 and
 3,
 the
 average
 amounts
 of
 private
 purchases
 made
 by
 subjects
 who
 chose
 to
 exit
 in
 the
universal-exit
 treatment
 track
 the
 predicted
 values
 quite
 well,
 and
 none
 of
 the
 differences
 are
 statistically
 different.
 There
is,
 however,
 a
 tendency
 for
 lower-income
 individuals
 to
 over-invest
 (by
 17
 and
 11%
 for
 individuals
 with
 incomes
 125
 and
275,
 respectively)
 and
 for
 higher-income
 individuals
 to
 under-invest
 (by
 5%
 for
 individuals
 with
 incomes
 700
 and
 1500).
For
 the
 conditional-exit
 treatment,
 individuals
 with
 incomes
 of
 700
 or
 1500
 who
 choose
 to
 exit
 invest
 about
 9%
 less
 than
predicted.
Result
 2.
 
In
 both
 of
 the
 universal-
 and
 conditional-exit
 treatments
 the
 private
 purchases
 by
 those
 individuals
 who
 chose
to
 exit
 are
 close
 to
 the
 amounts
 predicted
 by
 the
 theoretical
 model.
4.3.
 Mean
 preferred
 tax
 rates
Table
 4
 presents
 a
 comparison,
 by
 income,
 of
 the
 observed
 mean
 preferred
 (i.e.,
 submitted)
 tax
 rates
 and
 the
 theoreti-
cally
 predicted
 values.13 In
 the
 public-only
 treatment
 the
 observed
 mean
 preferred
 tax
 rates
 are
 decreasing
 in
 income
 (as
predicted),
 but
 they
 are
 slightly
 less
 (by
 less
 than
 10%)
 than
 predicted
 for
 incomes
 125,
 275,
 640
 and
 700
 and
 slightly
 greater
(by
 less
 than
 10%)
 than
 predicted
 for
 individuals
 with
 income
 of
 1500.14
Because
 the
 model
 for
 the
 universal-exit
 treatment
 predicts
 that
 individuals
 with
 income
 greater
 than
 125
 will
 exit,
 there
are
 no
 predicted
 tax
 rates
 for
 the
 universal-exit
 treatment,
 except
 for
 the
 lowest-income
 subjects,
 who
 prefer
 a
 tax
 rate
 of
0.559
 if
 they
 remain
 in
 the
 public
 system.
 Many
 of
 the
 lowest-income
 subjects
 did
 remain
 in
 the
 public-system
 and
 their
mean
 submitted
 rate
 was
 substantially
 higher
 than
 the
 predicted
 value.
 This
 is

between
 the
 rates
 predicted
 for

in

 individuals

 Overall,
 the
 behavior
 of

 in

In

 for

 the

 Mean
 implemented
 tax
 rates
We  now
 compare
 the
 observed
 mean
 implemented
 tax
 rates
 against
 the
 theoretically
 predicted
 values
 for
 each
 of
 the
three
 treatments
 as
 shown
 in
 Table
 5.
 The
 predicted
 tax
 rate
 in
 the
 public-only
 treatment
 is
 0.564
 and
 the
 actual
 mean
implemented
 tax
 rates
 in
 the
 public-only
 treatments
 (when
 paired
 with
 either
 exit
 treatment)
 do
 not
 differ
 from
 this
prediction.
 In
 addition,
 the
 actual
 mean
 implemented
 tax
 rate
 in
 the
 conditional-exit
 treatment
 did
 not
 differ
 from
 its
predicted
 tax
 rate.
 In
 the
 universal-exit
 treatment,
 when
 all
 subjects
 can
 choose
 to
 exit,
 there
 is
 no
 prediction
 for
 the
 tax
rate
 as
 all
 subjects,
 save
 the
 lowest
 income
 subject,
 are
 predicted
 to
 exit.
 If
 only
 the
 lowest
 income
 individual
 remained
 to
participate
 in
 the
 public
 system,
 then
 the
 predicted
 tax
 rate
 is
 0.559.
 The
 actual
 mean
 implemented
 tax
 rate
 in
 universal-exit
treatment
 differs
 statistically
 from
 the
 predicted
 tax
 rate
 and
 is
 consistent
 with
 an
 environment
 in
 which
 individuals
 with
incomes
 greater
 than
 125
 choose
 to
 participate
 in
 the
 public
 system.
We
 next
 test
 for
 differences
 in
 mean
 implemented
 tax
 rates
 across
 the
 three
 treatments.
 There
 is
 no
 signiﬁcant
 dif-
ference
 between
 the
 mean
 implemented
 tax
 rates
 from
 the
 public-only
 treatments
 when
 paired
 with
 the
 universal-exit
treatment
 and
 the
 public-only
 treatments
 when
 paired
 with
 the
 conditional-exit
 treatment,
 and
 between
 the
 universal-exit
and
 conditional-exit
 treatment
 tax
 rates.
 However,
 there
 is
 a
 signiﬁcant
 difference
 between
 the
 universal-exit
 and
 paired
public-only
 tax
 rates
 and
 between
 the
 conditional-exit
 and
 paired
 public-only
 tax
 rates.
Result

The
 mean
 implemented
 tax
 rates
 in
 the
 public-only
 and
 conditional-exit
 treatments
 are
 not
 signiﬁcantly
 different
from
 the
 rates
 predicted
 by
 the
 underlying

 model.
 The
 mean
 implemented
 tax
 rate
 in
 the
 universal-exit
 treatment
is
 signiﬁcantly
 higher
 than
 predicted.

 Inequality
 in
 the
 consumption
 of
 the
 private
 good
Distributional
 concerns
 ﬁgure
 prominently
 in
 the
 assessment
 of
 alternative
 systems
 of
 health
 care
 ﬁnance.
 In
 our
 setting,
income-related
 inequality
 in
 consumption
 (public
 provision
 plus
 private
 purchases
 among
 those
 who
 exit)
 is
 predicted
to
 differ
 substantially
 across
 the
 three
 ﬁnancing
 treatments
 (Table
 6).16 Consumption
 is
 predicted
 to
 be
 equal
 across
15 Out
 of
 100
 observations
 of
 decisions
 made
 by
 individuals
 with
 incomes
 of
 700
 or
 1500
 there
 are
 only
 six
 observations
 (three
 for
 individuals
 with
 income
of
 700
 and
 three
 for
 individuals
 with
 income
 of
 1500)
 when
 the
 individual
 does
 not
 exit.
 The
 mean
 tax
 rates
 selected
 by
 the
 individuals
 with
 income
 of
700
 and
 1500
 are
 0.628
 and
 0.750.
 Both
 of
 these
 are
 inconsistent
 with
 these
 individuals
 attempting
 to
 maximize
 their
 payoffs
 under
 any
 assumption
 of
 the
mix
 of
 individuals
 who
 will
 remain
 in
 the
 public
 system.
16 In
 contrast,
 the
 aggregate
 level
 of
 consumption
 is
 not
 predicted
 to
 not
 differ
 substantially
 across
 the
 treatments
 and,
 in
 fact,
 we
 ﬁnd
 no
 statistical
differences
 in
 observed
 aggregate
 consumption
 of
 the
 private
 good
 across
 the
 three
 treatments;
 nor
 does
 observed
 consumption
 differ
 statistically
 from
the
 predicted
 value
 for
 the
 public-only
 and
 universal-exit
 treatments.
 Consumption
 under
 conditional-exit,
 however,
 is
 less
 than
 predicted
 because
 the
high-income
 individuals
 who
 exit
 consume
 less
 privately
 than
 predicted.

income-groups
 under
 public-only
 ﬁnancing,
 to
 exhibit
 a
 strong
 pro-rich
 gradient
 under
 universal-exit,
 and
 to
 exhibit
 a
stepped
 pro-rich
 pattern
 under
 conditional-exit
 (equal
 consumption
 among
 the
 three
 lower
 income
 groups
 and
 then
 higher
consumption
 among
 the
 two
 high-income
 groups).
 We  measure
 the
 extent
 of
 income-related
 inequality
 in
 consumption
using
 the
 Concentration
 Index
 (CI),
 which
 has
 been
 applied
 widely
 within
 health
 economics
 to
 measure
 income-related
inequalities
 and
 inequities
 in
 health,
 health
 care
 consumption,
 and
 health
 care
 ﬁnancing
 (van
 Doorslaer
 and
 Van
 Ourti,
2011).
 The
 CI
 is
 directly
 analogous
 to
 the
 Gini
 Coefﬁcient,
 but
 instead
 of
 measuring
 univariate
 inequality
 (e.g.,
 inequality
in
 the
 distribution
 of
 income
 in
 the
 population),
 it
 is
 a
 bi-variate
 measure
 of
 the
 extent
 to
 which
 inequality
 in
 a
 variable
 of
interest,
 in
 this
 case,
 consumption
 of
 the
 private
 good,
 is
 systematically
 related
 to
 a
 second
 variable,
 in
 this
 case,
 income.
The
 CI
 takes
 on
 values
 in
 the
 interval
 [0,
 1],
 is
 zero
 when
 there
 is
 no
 income-related
 inequality,
 is
 positive
 when
 inequality
favors
 the
 rich,
 and
 is
 negative
 when
 inequality
 favors
 the
 poor.
 Among
 our
 ﬁnancing
 treatments,
 income-related
 inequality
is
 predicted
 to
 be
 least
 under
 public-only
 ﬁnancing
 and
 the
 most
 pro-rich
 under
 universal-exit.
 Because
 observed
 consump-
tion
 under
 the
 public-only
 treatments
 is
 equal
 across
 income
 levels,
 the
 CIs
 for
 public-only
 are
 zero
 and
 do
 not
 differ
 from
the
 predicted
 values.
 Pro-rich
 income-inequality
 in
 each
 of
 universal-
 and
 conditional-exit
 is
 signiﬁcantly
 different
 from
public-only
 ﬁnancing,
 and
 although
 the
 CI
 for
 universal-exit
 is
 less
 than
 that
 for
 conditional-exit,
 the
 difference
 between
the
 two
 exit
 treatments
 is
 not
 statistically
 signiﬁcant.
 The
 CI
 for
 universal-exit
 is
 signiﬁcantly
 less
 than
 its
 predicted
 value,
indicating
 less-than-predicted
 income-related
 inequality,
 due
 to
 the
 less-than-predicted
 rate
 of
 exit
 among
 high-income
individuals.
 The
 CI
 for
 conditional
 exit
 is
 not
 signiﬁcantly
 different
 than
 its
 predicted
 value.
Result

Pro-rich
 income-related
 inequality
 in
 consumption
 of
 the
 private
 good
 is
 substantially
 greater
 in
 the
 exit
 treat-
ments
 than
 in
 the
 public-only
 treatment,
 though
 for
 the
 universal-exit

 the
 pro-rich

 is

4.6.
 Inequalities
 in
 total
 payoffs
Total
 payoffs
 provide
 a
 rough
 measure
 of
 social
 welfare
 in
 our
 environment.
 The
 predicted
 total
 payoffs
 are
 largest
 for
 the
public-only
 treatment
 and
 smallest
 for
 the
 universal-exit
 treatment,
 and,
 as
 with
 consumption,
 income-related
 inequality
 is
predicted
 to
 be
 smallest
 in
 the
 public-only
 treatment,
 reﬂecting
 the
 redistribution
 that
 occurs
 under
 public-only
 ﬁnancing
(Table
 7).
 As
 predicted,
 observed
 total
 payoffs
 are
 higher
 in
 the
 public-only
 treatment
 than
 in
 either
 of
 the
 two
 exit
 treatments
(the
 difference
 between
 the
 exit
 treatments
 is
 not
 statistically
 signiﬁcant).
 The
 observed
 total
 payoffs
 statistically
 differ
 from
the
 predicted
 values
 only
 for
 the
 conditional-exit
 treatment,
 again
 reﬂecting
 the
 under-investment
 by
 the
 high-income
subjects
 who
 exited.
 For
 all
 three
 treatments
 the
 observed
 CIs
 do
 not
 differ
 signiﬁcantly
 from
 their
 predicted
 values.
 As
expected,
 the
 CI
 for
 public-only
 ﬁnancing
 is
 signiﬁcantly
 less
 than
 that
 for
 both
 universal-exit
 and
 conditional-exit,
 although
the
 difference
 between
 the
 two
 mixed-ﬁnancing
 treatments
 is
 not
 signiﬁcant.
Result

The
 level
 and
 distribution
 of
 mean
 total
 payoffs
 in
 the
 public-only
 treatment
 do
 not
 differ
 from
 the
 predictions,
are
 greater
 than
 in
 both
 exit
 treatments,
 and
 display
 less
 income-related
 inequality
 than
 in
 both
 exit
 treatments.
5.
 Why
 don’t
 individuals
 exit
 as
 predicted?
The
 difference
 in
 subject
 exit
 behavior
 across
 the
 two
 exit
 treatments
 is
 surprising.
 As
 noted,
 the
 two
 highest-income
individuals
 in
 the
 conditional-exit
 treatment
 appeared
 to
 recognize
 the
 beneﬁts
 of
 exiting
 and
 consequently
 exited
 at
 rates
comparable
 to
 the
 theoretical
 predictions.
 However,
 in
 the
 universal-exit
 treatment
 individuals
 with
 the
 same
 incomes
exited
 at
 rates
 substantially
 less
 than
 in
 conditional-exit.
 We  offer
 three
 conjectures
 that
 might
 account
 for
 this
 difference.
First,
 high-income
 individuals
 in
 the
 universal-exit
 treatment
 might
 not
 exit
 as
 predicted
 due
 to
 altruism.
 Altruistic
 or
cooperative
 preferences
 would
 be
 consistent
 with
 high-income
 individuals
 staying
 and
 supporting
 the
 public
 system
 rather
than
 exiting
 if
 they
 worried
 that
 the
 public
 system
 would
 completely
 unravel
 if
 they
 exited
 because
 lower-income
 individuals

would
 have
 the
 incentive
 to
 exit
 once
 the
 high-income
 individuals
 exit.
 In
 contrast,
 altruistic
 high-income
 individuals
 would
have
 fewer
 qualms
 about
 exiting
 in
 the
 conditional-exit
 treatment
 knowing
 that
 middle-income
 individuals
 would
 have
 to
stay
 and
 help
 fund
 the
 public
 system
 and
 provide
 income
 transfers
 to
 the
 lowest-income
 individuals.
Second,
 individuals
 in
 our
 universal-exit
 treatment
 might
 not
 exit
 as
 predicted
 due
 to
 a
 priming
 bias.
 That
 is,
 for
 reasons
unrelated
 to
 altruistic
 preferences,
 high-income
 individuals
 may
 not
 exit
 as
 predicted
 if
 they
 feel
 that
 the
 environment
into
 which
 they
 are
 placed
 is
 an
 environment
 primed
 with
 public
 provision.17 While
 the
 highest-income
 individuals
 may
recognize
 the
 incentive
 to
 exit,
 they
 may
 believe
 that
 they
 have
 an
 obligation
 to
 help
 maintain
 this
 public
 system.
 This
 bias
may
 not
 present
 itself
 in
 the
 conditional-exit
 treatment
 because
 high-income
 individuals
 are
 speciﬁcally
 told
 that
 they
 alone
may
 exit
 from
 the
 public
 system.
 The
 conditional-exit
 environment
 grants
 permission
 for
 the
 high-income
 individuals
 to
exit
 while
 requiring
 the
 middle-
 and
 low
 income-individuals
 to
 participate
 in
 the
 public
 system.
Third,
 it
 may
 take
 time
 for
 individuals
 in
 the
 universal-exit
 treatment
 to
 realize
 that
 the
 highest-income
 person
 should
exit
 from
 the
 public
 system
 and
 that
 the
 natural
 consequence
 of
 this
 is
 that
 the
 next-highest-income
 individual
 should
 then
exit
 until
 the
 unraveling
 process
 takes
 place
 and
 everyone
 exits.
 This
 suggests
 that
 exit
 rates
 in
 the
 universal-exit
 treatment
would
 be
 higher
 if
 it
 was
 easier
 for
 this
 unraveling
 process
 to
 take
 place
 faster.
We
 investigated
 all
 three
 of
 these
 conjectures.
 First,
 we
 investigated
 the
 possibility
 that
 the
 decision
 to
 exit
 from
 the
 public
system
 may
 be
 related
 to
 the
 cooperativeness
 or
 altruism
 of
 the
 participants.
 Because
 participating
 in
 the
 public
 system
results
 in
 income
 redistribution
 from
 high-income
 participants
 to
 low-income
 participants,
 the
 social-value
 orientations
 of
the
 participants
 may
 be
 important.
 If
 our
 conjecture
 is
 true,
 the
 social-value
 orientation
 of
 subjects
 should
 be
 related
 to
 their
exit
 behavior.
To
 explore
 the
 second,
 we
 modiﬁed
 our
 design
 so
 that
 subjects
 participated
 in
 a
 conditional-exit
 treatment
 for
 10
 periods
and
 then
 switched
 to
 the
 universal-exit
 treatment
 for
 another
 10
 periods.
 If
 our
 conjecture
 is
 true,
 exposing
 participants
 ﬁrst
to
 the
 conditional-exit
 treatment
 will
 prime
 high-income
 subjects
 to
 exit
 more
 frequently
 in
 the
 subsequent
 universal-exit
treatment,
 thereby
 providing
 greater
 incentive
 for
 lower-income
 individuals
 to
 exit.
To
 examine
 the
 third
 conjecture,
 we
 modiﬁed
 our
 design
 so
 that
 each
 subject
 had
 one
 of
 the
 ﬁve
 income
 levels
 for
 all
decision
 periods
 (rather
 than
 experiencing
 all
 ﬁve
 income
 levels
 in
 random
 order),
 thereby
 giving
 high-income
 subjects
greater
 opportunity
 to
 learn
 the
 beneﬁts
 of
 exiting
 and
 more
 readily
 prompting
 the
 cascade
 of
 exits
 down
 the
 income
distribution.
 To
 test
 this
 we
 used
 the
 design
 in
 which
 subjects
 ﬁrst
 participated
 in
 a
 public-only
 treatment
 for
 10
 decision
periods
 and
 then
 universal-exit
 treatment
 for
 another
 10
 decision
 periods,
 but
 modiﬁed
 it
 so
 that
 individuals
 had
 the
 same
income
 for
 all
 20
 decision-periods.
 In
 a
 further
 minor
 variation
 of
 this,
 we  also
 ran
 this
 ﬁxed-income
 design
 in
 which
 all
subjects
 were
 told
 after
 each
 period
 which
 of
 the
 ﬁve
 subjects
 chose
 to
 exit,
 hypothesizing
 that
 explicit
 information
 about
the
 income
 levels
 of
 the
 individuals
 who
 exit
 may
 affect
 exit
 behavior
 and
 may
 speed
 up
 the
 predicted
 cascade
 of
 exits.

about
 the
 income
 of
 the
 individuals
 who
 exited
 is
 also
 provided
 to
 everyone.
 Data
 for
 each
 of
 the
 three
 new
 designs
 were
obtained
 from
 three
 sessions
 (i.e.,
 nine
 in
 total),
 each
 of
 which
 included
 two
 independent
 groups
 of
 ﬁve
 subjects
 who
 were
randomly
 assigned
 to
 groups.
To
 test
 the
 ﬁrst
 conjecture,
 the
 sessions
 described
 in
 columns
 (4)
 and
 (5)
 were
 followed
 by
 a
 brief
 social-value-orientation
ring
 game
 similar
 to
 those
 presented
 in
 Mentzakis
 and
 Mestelman
 (2013).18 This
 allowed
 individuals
 to
 be
 categorized
 as
having
 altruistic,
 cooperative,
 individualistic
 or
 competitive
 other-regarding
 preferences
 based
 on
 their
 decisions
 in
 the
non-strategic
 payoff
 allocation
 ring
 game.
 We  found
 no
 evidence
 that
 individuals’
 exit
 decisions
 were
 correlated
 with
 either
a
 continuous
 or
 categorical
 measure
 of
 their
 social
 value
 orientation.
However,
 the
 priming
 design
 had
 the
 expected
 effect
 on
 exit
 rates:
 comparing
 columns
 (1)
 and
 (3)
 reveals
 that
 high-
income
 individuals
 in
 the
 universal-exit
 treatment
 that
 followed
 the
 conditional-exit
 treatment
 exited
 at
 rates
 equivalent
 to
rates
 in
 the
 conditional-exit
 treatments
 and
 not
 signiﬁcantly
 different
 from
 their
 predicted
 values.
 Furthermore,
 the
 higher
rates
 of
 exit
 among
 high-income
 individuals
 cause
 the
 exit
 rates
 to
 increase
 among
 those
 with
 incomes
 of
 125,
 275
 and
 640.
These
 exit
 rates
 rise
 from
 0.080,
 0.160
 and
 0.560
 to
 0.160,
 0.600
 and
 0.800,
 respectively
 (see
 columns
 (2)
 and
 (3)),
 although
these
 are
 still
 signiﬁcantly
 below
 the
 exit
 prediction
 of
 1.00.
 The
 rate
 of
 exit
 for
 all
 individuals
 who
 are
 expected
 to
 exit
 rises
from
 55%
 in
 the
 original
 universal-exit
 treatments
 to
 a
 signiﬁcantly
 higher
 80%
 in
 the
 primed
 universal-exit
 treatment.
Learning
 also
 appears
 to
 explain
 part
 of
 the
 low
 exit
 rate
 in
 the
 universal-exit
 treatments.
 A
 comparison
 of
 columns
 (2)
and
 (4)
 reveals
 that
 keeping
 subjects’
 incomes
 constant
 (so
 high-income
 subjects
 more
 easily
 learn
 the
 beneﬁts
 of
 exiting)
also
 leads
 to
 higher
 rates
 of
 exit
 by
 high-income
 individuals.
 Further
 providing
 subjects
 information
 after
 each
 period
 about
the
 incomes
 of
 those
 who
 chose
 to
 exit
 does
 not
 impact
 exit
 behavior
 as
 seen
 by
 comparing
 columns
 (5)
 and
 (4).
These
 supplemental
 ﬁndings
 indicate
 that
 the
 low
 exit
 rates
 by
 high-income
 individuals
 in
 the
 universal-exit
 treatment
are
 not
 driven
 by
 other-regarding
 preferences,
 and
 likely
 derive
 at
 least
 in
 part
 from
 a
 bias
 in
 favor
 of
 public
 support
 that
may
 be
 overcome
 by
 making
 it
 clear
 that
 exit
 is
 permitted
 or
 by
 providing
 sufﬁcient
 experience
 in
 the
 environment
 so
 that
they
 may
 learn
 the
 individual
 advantage
 of
 exiting.
 However,
 these
 factors
 cannot
 explain
 all
 of
 the
 differences
 observed
between
 the
 universal-exit
 treatments,
 conditional-exit
 treatments
 and
 the
 theoretical
 predictions.
6.
 Health
 framing
The
 results
 presented
 above
 are
 based
 on
 sessions
 that
 use
 an
 investment
 context,
 as
 is
 common
 in
 the
 experimental
literature
 for
 ﬁelds
 such
 as
 environmental
 economics
 and
 public
 ﬁnance.
 While
 our
 theoretical
 model
 does
 not
 predict
 any
behavioral
 differences
 between
 alternative
 frames
 used
 to
 give
 a
 subject
 context,
 the
 question
 of
 whether
 health
 care
 framing
effects
 might
 exist
 in
 our
 setting
 is
 an
 interesting
 one.19 To
 test
 for
 possible
 health
 care
 framing
 effects,
 we
 replicated
 the
earlier
 public-only,
 universal-exit
 and
 conditional-exit
 treatments
 using
 an
 explicit
 health
 care
 frame.
These
 health-frame
 sessions
 simply
 modiﬁed
 the
 language
 of
 the
 experimental
 instructions
 without
 changing
 the
 under-
lying
 decision
 problem
 of
 the
 experiment.
 Speciﬁcally,
 the
 investment
 frame
 terminology
 of
 a
 “Group
 Investment
 Fund”
being
 invested
 in
 “Market
 A”
 was
 changed
 to
 a
 “Group
 Health
 Care
 Fund”
 being
 deposited
 into
 a
 “Health
 Care
 Account”.
Additionally,
 the
 terminology
 of
 a
 “Private
 Investment
 Fund”
 being
 invested
 into
 “Market
 B”
 was
 reworded
 to
 a
 “Private
Fund”
 being
 invested
 into
 a
 “Private
 Investment
 Account”.
 This
 modiﬁed
 terminology
 was
 introduced
 to
 provide
 subjects
with
 a
 decision
 between
 an
 explicitly
 named
 health
 care
 option
 and
 an
 explicitly
 named
 private
 investment
 option
 while
ensuring
 an
 identical
 outcome
 and
 payoff
 situation
 between
 the
 two
 frames.
Table
 9
 presents
 the
 results
 for
 the
 exit
 rate,
 private
 purchase
 decision,
 and
 implemented
 tax
 rate
 for
 the
 health-frame
sessions.
 The
 observed
 proportion
 of
 exits
 in
 the
 health-frame
 universal-exit
 treatment
 was
 found
 to
 be
 signiﬁcantly
 higher,
and
 closer
 to
 the
 predicted
 rate
 of
 100%,
 than
 that
 observed
 in
 the
 neutral
 investment
 treatments.
 Under
 the
 health
 frame
subjects
 exhibited
 an
 increase
 in
 exit
 rates
 of
 more
 than
 20
 percentage
 points
 on
 average.
 Furthermore,
 implemented
 tax
 rates
were
 found
 to
 be
 signiﬁcantly
 lower
 in
 health-frame
 conditional-exit
 treatments
 than
 when
 neutrally
 framed,
 although
 on
average
 only
 roughly
 10
 percentage
 points
 lower.
 However,
 not
 all
 relevant
 outcomes
 were
 found
 to
 exhibit
 framing
 effects,
as
 implemented
 tax
 rates
 under
 the
 universal-exit
 treatment
 were
 not
 found
 to
 be
 signiﬁcantly
 different
 from
 those
 found
in
 the
 neutral-frame
 treatments;
 additionally,
 the
 private
 purchase
 amount
 of
 those
 who
 do
 exit
 in
 the
 health
 frame
 were
also
 not
 found
 to
 be
 signiﬁcantly
 different
 from
 their
 neutral-frame
 counterparts
 for
 either
 the
 universal-
 or
 conditional-exit
treatments.
While
 the
 increase
 in
 exit
 rates
 under
 the
 health
 frame
 produced
 results
 more
 consistent
 with
 our
 underlying
 theoretical
model,
 it
 is
 difﬁcult
 to
 know
 what
 precisely
 might
 be
 driving
 these
 framing
 effects,
 beyond
 the
 fact
 they
 were
 induced
 by
 the
framing
 change
 itself.
 While
 the
 decisions
 were
 framed
 as
 health-related
 choices,
 our
 experiment
 did
 not
 include
 any
 health
consequences
 beyond
 those
 in
 situations
 in
 which
 untreated
 health
 care
 issues
 result
 in
 lost
 income
 due
 to
 an
 illness.
 This
differs
 from
 both
 the
 real
 world,
 and
 alternative
 experimental
 designs
 that
 have
 been
 adopted
 in
 which
 subject
 decisions
18 While
 the
 social-value
 orientation
 game
 used
 was
 developed
 by
 Griesinger
 and
 Livingston
 (1973)
 and
 Liebrand
 (1984),
 the
 exact
 ring
 game
 used
 was
identical
 to
 the
 non-incentivized
 social-value-orientation
 mechanism
 presented
 in
 Mentzakis
 and
 Mestelman
 (2013).
 The
 authors
 found
 no
 hypothetical
bias
 when
 comparing
 these
 social-value-orientation
 measures
 to
 those
 elicited
 when
 salient
 monetary
 incentives
 were
 involved.
19 Harrison
 and
 List
 (2004)
 discuss
 the
 need
 to
 consider
 the
 framing
 context
 of
 an
 experiment
 before
 drawing
 general
 conclusions
 because
 without
 that
context
 the
 experimenter
 is
 unable
 to
 control
 for
 the
 frames
 subjects
 impose
 themselves.

 Conclusion
This
 paper
 uses
 a
 controlled
 laboratory
 experiment
 to
 test
 theoretical
 predictions
 regarding
 mixed
 public
 and
 private
ﬁnancing
 for
 a
 private
 good
 that
 allows
 for
 exit
 from
 the
 public
 system,
 similar
 to
 ﬁnancing
 of
 health
 care
 in
 countries
 such
 as
Germany.
 In
 such
 systems,
 individuals
 who
 choose
 to
 exit
 the
 public
 system
 neither
 contribute
 to
 its
 ﬁnancing
 nor
 consume
any
 of
 the
 publicly
 provided
 health
 care,
 but
 instead
 purchase
 health
 care
 privately.
 We  investigated
 two
 exit
 designs:
a
 universal-exit
 scheme
 in
 which
 everyone
 is
 eligible
 to
 exit,
 and
 a
 conditional-exit
 scheme
 in
 which
 only
 high-income
individuals
 are
 eligible
 to
 exit.
Our
 results
 largely
 conﬁrm
 the
 theoretical
 predictions
 regarding
 exit
 behavior
 under
 the
 conditional-exit
 design.
 Both
exit
 rates
 by
 high-income
 individuals
 and
 the
 amounts
 of
 private
 purchases
 accord
 well
 with
 the
 theoretical
 predictions.
In
 contrast,
 our
 results
 are
 not
 consistent
 with
 the
 prediction
 that,
 under
 universal-exit,
 support
 for
 public
 provision
 will
unravel.
 High-income
 individuals
 in
 the
 universal-exit
 treatment
 did
 not
 exit
 as
 much
 as
 predicted;
 and
 conditional
 on
 many
high-income
 individuals
 remaining
 in
 the
 public
 system,
 it
 was
 then
 rational
 for
 lower-income
 individuals
 to
 also
 remain
(to
 beneﬁt
 from
 the
 income
 redistribution
 carried
 out
 through
 public
 provision).
A
 key
 question
 is
 why
 high-income
 individuals
 failed
 to
 exit
 as
 predicted
 in
 the
 universal-exit
 treatment
 but
 did
 exit
largely
 as
 predicted
 under
 conditional-exit.
 Additional
 sessions
 using
 modiﬁed
 designs
 to
 test
 some
 speciﬁc
 conjectures
regarding
 this
 unexpected
 behavior
 found
 that
 this
 exit
 behavior
 was
 not
 related
 to
 other-regarding
 preferences
 among
subjects.
 Low
 rates
 of
 exit
 in
 the
 universal-exit
 treatment
 could
 have
 been
 due
 to
 the
 fact
 that
 this
 treatment
 presented
 the
public
 system
 as
 the
 default
 option
 from
 which
 one
 had
 to
 actively
 choose
 to
 exit,
 and
 it
 was
 not
 obvious
 whether
 such
 exit
was
 socially
 approved.
 In
 contrast,
 the
 conditional-exit
 treatment
 explicitly
 and
 uniquely
 gave
 high-income
 individuals
 the
option
 to
 exit.
 Importantly,
 priming
 the
 universal-exit
 treatment
 with
 10
 periods
 of
 the
 conditional-exit
 treatment
 changed
behavior:
 high-income
 individuals
 now
 recognized
 the
 value
 of
 exit,
 causing
 them
 to
 exit
 at
 higher
 rates,
 and
 once
 others
recognized
 that
 the
 high
 income
 individuals
 were
 exiting
 they
 followed.
 Although
 this
 resulted
 in
 signiﬁcantly
 more
 exit
than
 in
 the
 unprimed
 universal-exit
 treatment,
 there
 were
 still
 individuals
 who
 could
 have,
 but
 did
 not
 exit.
 Even
 when
holding
 incomes
 constant
 and
 providing
 full
 information
 regarding
 the
 income
 levels
 of
 those
 subjects
 who
 exited,
 subjects
did
 not
 totally
 abandon
 the
 public
 system
 as
 predicted.
We
 also
 tested
 a
 version
 of
 the
 public-only,
 universal-exit
 and
 conditional-exit
 treatments
 using
 an
 explicit
 health
 care
frame.
 In
 the
 health
 frame,
 for
 conditional
 exit
 we
 observed
 exit
 rates
 comparable
 to
 those
 in
 the
 non-health
 frame,
 but
for
 the
 universal-exit
 treatment
 we
 observed
 exit
 rates
 higher
 than
 in
 the
 non-health
 frame.
 These
 higher
 exit
 rates
 under
the
 health
 frame
 in
 the
 universal-exit
 treatment
 are
 more
 consistent
 with
 the
 predictions
 from
 our
 theoretical
 model.
 Our
design
 did
 not
 allow
 us
 to
 identify
 what
 about
 the
 health
 care
 frame
 drove
 this
 result.
 This
 is
 an
 important
 question
 for
future
 health-related
 experiments
 to
 investigate
 in
 greater
 detail.20
Our
 results
 have
 a
 number
 of
 potential
 policy
 implications
 pertaining
 to
 health
 care
 ﬁnancing,
 health
 care
 consumption,
and
 overall
 beneﬁts.21 The
 results
 from
 our
 main
 design
 support
 the
 predictions
 for
 a
 public-only
 system
 of
 health
 care
20 It
 would
 also
 be
 interesting
 to
 compare
 exit
 behavior
 under
 health
 care
 frames
 with
 that
 for
 other
 sector
 frames,
 such
 as
 education.
21 We draw
 these
 implications
 based
 on
 the
 results
 presented
 in
 Tables
 6
 and
 7,
 which
 were
 obtained
 in
 the
 investment
 frame
 in
 which
 the
 collective
good
 was
 not
 identiﬁed
 as
 health
 care.
 However,
 given
 the
 tax
 rates
 and
 exit
 rates
 observed
 subsequently
 in
 the
 health
 care
 frame,
 the
 implications
 carry
over
 in
 a
 straightforward
 way
 to
 health
 care
 environments.

ﬁnancing.
 If
 the
 individuals
 participating
 in
 this
 environment
 were
 given
 the
 opportunity
 to
 vote
 on
 replacing
 a
 private-only
health
 care
 system
 by
 a
 publicly
 ﬁnanced
 system,
 the
 individuals
 in
 the
 three
 lower
 quintiles
 of
 the
 income
 distribution
would
 be
 better
 off
 by
 replacing
 the
 private-only
 system.22 These
 results
 support
 what
 is
 typically
 expected
 from
 a
 policy
that
 replaces
 private
 provision
 with
 tax-ﬁnanced
 uniform
 public
 provision.
When
 universal-exit
 was
 offered
 to
 the
 individuals
 in
 the
 public-only
 environment,
 over
 half
 of
 the
 individuals
 in
 the
 top
four
 quintiles
 chose
 to
 exit.
 This
 exit
 causes
 the
 level
 of
 public
 provision
 to
 fall
 and
 the
 amount
 available
 to
 the
 people
 in
 the
lower
 three
 quintiles
 to
 be
 less
 than
 the
 amount
 of
 public
 provision
 available
 to
 them
 in
 the
 public-only
 system.23 When
our
 universal-exit
 sessions
 were
 framed
 as
 health
 care
 an
 even
 larger
 percentage
 of
 individuals
 in
 the
 top
 four
 quintiles
chose
 to
 exit,
 leading
 to
 an
 even
 greater
 reduction
 in
 publicly
 provided
 health
 care
 and
 health
 care
 consumption
 by
 the
individuals
 in
 the
 lower
 three
 income
 quintiles.
 The
 only
 individuals
 who
 ultimately
 beneﬁt
 from
 universal-exit
 compared
to
 public-only
 are
 those
 in
 the
 highest-income
 quintile.
 This
 is
 also
 true
 under
 conditional
 exit,
 although
 those
 in
 the
 second
highest
 income
 quintile
 are
 no
 worse
 off
 in
 this
 type
 of
 mixed
 ﬁnancing
 system.
As
 only
 the
 individuals
 in
 the
 highest
 income
 quintile
 beneﬁt
 by
 moving
 from
 a
 public-only
 system
 to
 systems
 that
include
 universal-
 or
 conditional-exit
 options,
 we
 would
 expect
 that
 neither
 of
 the
 exit
 environments
 would
 be
 preferred
 by
a
 majority
 of
 individuals
 who
 had
 knowledge
 of
 all
 three
 environments.
 With
 experience
 in
 the
 conditional-
 and
 universal-
exit
 environments,
 the
 individuals
 in
 the
 upper
 three
 quintiles
 would
 prefer
 a
 system
 of
 private
 health
 care
 to
 either
 of
 the
exit
 environments.24
If
 majority-rule
 voting
 were
 the
 collective
 choice
 mechanism
 used
 to
 select
 among
 pure
 private
 ﬁnance,
 pure
 public
ﬁnance,
 and
 mixed
 public
 and
 private
 ﬁnancing
 with
 an
 exit
 option,
 then
 both
 theoretically
 and
 empirically
 purely
 publicly
ﬁnanced
 health
 care
 would
 be
 selected
 by
 a
 majority
 of
 individuals.
 To
 the
 extent
 that
 our
 environment
 captures
 the
 naturally
occurring
 environment,
 the
 existence
 of
 a
 public
 ﬁnancing
 system
 of
 health
 care
 with
 an
 exit
 option
 would
 not
 arise
 through
majority-rule
 voting
 that
 is
 fully
 representative
 of
 the
 people
 in
 the
 environment.
Our
 ﬁndings
 also
 suggest
 a
 number
 of
 other
 useful
 directions
 for
 future
 research
 on
 mixed
 systems
 of
 health
 care
 ﬁnance.
First,
 we
 used
 an
 income
 condition
 for
 the
 conditional-exit
 treatment.
 It
 would
 be
 interesting
 to
 see
 if
 the
 same
 pattern
 of
results
 hold
 when
 an
 occupation
 condition
 is
 used
 instead,
 as
 is
 the
 case
 in
 some
 systems
 that
 allow
 exit.
 Second,
 it
 would
be
 informative
 to
 run
 a
 design
 in
 which,
 rather
 than
 give
 people
 the
 opportunity
 to
 exit
 from
 a
 public
 system
 (which
 serves
as
 the
 baseline),
 give
 them
 opportunity
 to
 enter
 into
 the
 collective
 provision
 of
 the
 private
 good
 from
 a
 baseline
 of
 pure
private
 provision.
 And
 ﬁnally,
 future
 research
 should
 explore
 the
 impact
 of
 modiﬁed
 assumptions
 regarding,
 for
 example,
differences
 in
 transaction
 costs
 between
 public
 and
 private
 consumption,
 differences
 in
 uncertainty
 associated
 with
 public
provision
 compared
 to
 private
 consumption
 and
 the
 public
 provision
 of
 a
 private
 health
 care
 good
 with
 positive
 externalities
(such
 as
 result
 from
 vaccinations
 against
 infectious
 diseases).

Due to the popularity of social media, patients are increasingly using social media for the social support exchange 
to improve health outcomes. To understand this phenomenon of social media-enabled healthcare, we propose a 
conceptual framework by integrating literature from three areas—social media affordance, online social support, 
and health behaviors and outcomes—with the goal of developing propositions on how social media can help 
patients improve self-management of chronic diseases. We identified and distinguished three social media 
affordances: affordance for community co-creation, affordance for social learning, and affordance for social 
relationships. We also distinguish three kinds of social support and tailored them to the healthcare domain and 
the social media context: informational support, emotional support, and experiential support. We posit the 
following: (a) social media affordances foster social support, where co-creation facilitates informational support, 
user interaction facilitates emotional support, and social learning facilitates experiential support; (b) informa­
tional support and experiential support are both linked to self-care; and (c) informational support and emotional 
support are both linked to psychological health. Our work advances the literature in the area of social media- 
enabled healthcare.   
“The intersection of healthcare and social media represents a promising 
space for future IS research” (Fichman et al., 2011, 424) 
1. Introduction 
Because of its popularity, social media greatly increases the volume 
of user-generated content and makes it available to anyone at any time, 
thus magnifying its impacts. It offers users a convenient venue to 
communicate with others quickly and inexpensively, and thus social 
media has become a popular platform for exchanging health-related 
information with each other. It is clear that social media has facili­
tated an efficient and low-cost approach to healthcare services, enabling 
patients with common health conditions to collaborate and interact with 
one another and acquire support for self-care (Shuyler and Knight, 2003; 
Yan et al., 2015), thus improving health outcomes (Xiao et al., 2014; 
Yan and Tan, 2014). For example, patients use social media (i.e., Face­
book and Twitter) to exchange social support with other patients who 
have similar health issues and to assist with each other’s health decisions 
by providing suggestions and recommendations about healthcare 
(Antheunis et al., 2013; Maloney-Krichmar and Preece, 2005). For 
another example, online forums and online health groups have been set 
up on social media by people with similar health conditions (in partic­
ular, chronic diseases) in order to collaborate with each other by sharing 
their knowledge and personal experiences and by providing healthcare 
advice (Greene et al., 2011). Health care professionals (e.g., clinicians) 
have been increasingly using social media to share their health-related 
information and knowledge and answer patients’ health-related ques­
tions (e.g., Matthews et al., 2002, Genuis, 2013, Von Muhlen and 
Ohno-Machado, 2012). Such clinician-generated content can also help 
patients understand their health conditions and make appropriate 
health decisions. For example, health care professionals have found 
social-media-based discussion forums useful for educating patients and 
facilitating their self-management of chronic diseases (De Angelis et al., 
2018). In this way, patients can effectively manage their chronic dis­
eases and improve their health outcomes by interacting with clinicians 
on social media.

The foregoing discussion suggests that social media usually offer a 
large amount of health-related information contributed by multiple 
stakeholders, including health care professionals (i.e., doctors) and lay 
people (i.e., patients) (i.e., patients) (e.g., Li et al., 2018, Tremblay et al., 
2016). The social support gained from the shared content helps patients 
improve their self-care and health outcomes (Jadad et al., 2000). In 
particular, patients who have chronic diseases, disabilities, or cancers 
can find social media particularly useful because social media enables 
them to seek support from peers or experts to sustain their 
self-management of such long-term diseases (Merolli et al., 2013). All of 
these cases illustrate the fact that patients have been increasingly using 
social media as an innovative technology approach for the social support 
exchange as well as to affect self-management of chronic diseases, indi­
cating that patients’ self-management is changing because social media 
is involved. It is clear that social media is now playing a key role in the 
self-management of chronic diseases and sits at the core of the social 
support exchange between patients on various social media platforms. 
We name this phenomenon social media-enabled healthcare. Although 
some prior studies have recognized many benefits of using social media 
for self-management of chronic diseases (e.g., Partridge et al., 2018, 
Bardhan et al., 2020), there is still little enhanced understanding of how 
patients can do that. Therefore, our work can address this research gap 
by explicitly explaining such a new phenomenon. 
In this phenomenon, social support is central to improving patients’ 
health behaviors and health outcomes because patients have been 
actively seeking or providing different kinds of social support on social 
media for self-management of chronic disease (Yan et al., 2015; Yan and 
Tan, 2014). There is considerable literature indicating that social sup­
port is a multidimensional construct consisting of various forms of 
support, including informational support, emotional support, instru­
mental support, and companionship (Berkman et al., 2000; House, 
1981). Social support has been demonstrated to have an impact on 
various health outcomes such as health behavior, psychological health, 
and physical health (Uchino, 2006; Uchino, 2009). It is understood that 
social support has a positive impact on health outcomes, but there have 
been few studies on how different forms of social support may lead to 
different types of health outcomes. Indeed, more generally, there is scant 
literature examining the implications of social media in the healthcare 
domain (Fichman et al., 2011), suggesting that the phenomenon of so­
cial media-enabled healthcare is under-theorized. Markus and Silver 
(2008) argued that “the continual emergence of new technologies 
inevitably requires ongoing conceptual development”, and thus a con­
ceptual framework is essential to understand this emerging phenomenon 
that is currently under-development. Therefore, the objective of this 
study is to provide a conceptual framework for understanding the 
social-media-enabled healthcare phenomenon based on existing social 
support and social media affordances. 
Social media affordance stems from technology affordance, which 
refers to the notion of “opportunities for action” provided to a user by a 
computerized system under particular circumstances (Argyris and 
Monu, 2015; Gibson, 2014; Markus and Silver, 2008). The design fea­
tures of social media provide users the opportunity to share their 
knowledge with others continually, thus increasing user engagement (e. 
g. Majchrzak et al., 2013, Treem and Leonardi, 2013). By taking ad­
vantages of technology affordance, social media has changed the process 
of sharing information and knowledge online and created new channels 
for connecting users, thus allowing individuals to collaborate on various 
tasks (Faraj et al., 2011). Technology affordance enables users to ex­
change resources with others on social media, thus fostering different 
types of social support based on what information they exchange and 
with whom they exchange it. Based on the technology affordance the­
ory, we have identified three types of social media affordance: afford­
ance for community co-creation, affordance for social learning, and 
affordance for social relationships. Although social media affordances 
can empower users to act in a technology-mediated environment, they 
fail to address the effects of social media on people’s behaviors and 
health outcomes. Thus, we have integrated them with social support 
theory to explain how they can foster different forms of social support on 
social media. Specially, we extend social support theory to a social 
media context, identify three types of social support (informational, 
emotional, and experiential), and introduce new relationships among 
them. 
Our work provides novel theoretical insight by integrating these two 
theories into a fresh conceptual framework while also extending the 
existing theory to understand the social media-enabled healthcare 
phenomenon more clearly. Specifically, we have combined social media 
affordance and social support theories with the literature on self- 
management of chronic diseases to develop propositions on how social 
media affordance can facilitate different forms of social support on so­
cial media, which could improve patients’ self-care behavior and 
physical and psychological health. Our work makes original contribu­
tions to the IT and healthcare literature. First, our work provides insights 
to the social media-enabled healthcare phenomenon that creates new 
values for social media in healthcare from a patient perspective by 
focusing on how patients can use social media to exchange social sup­
port and improve health outcomes. It fills in the research gap of the 
implications of social media in healthcare from a patient’s perspective 
(Househ et al., 2014; Fichman et al., 2011). It provides theoretical in­
sights about social media that can serve as an advanced 
technology-based approach for the self-management of chronic diseases 
in the domain of social media-enabled healthcare. It advances the pre­
vious literature by extending the use of social media in healthcare. The 
multidisciplinary nature of this phenomenon can add great IT value to 
healthcare because "IS needs to strengthen its ties with contributing 
disciplines" (Power, 2003). Second, our work introduces social media 
affordances from a technology affordance perspective. Drawing from the 
previous literature, we identified and distinguished three primary types 
of social media affordance: affordance for community co-creation, 
affordance for social learning, and affordance for social relationships. 
We further proposed how they lead to different kinds of social support 
on social media. These propositions are novel and provide a clearer 
theoretical understanding of the application of social media in health­
care. Third, our work advances social support literature and identifies 
three primary forms of social support on social media for the 
self-management of chronic diseases. We introduce new relationships 
among social supports by exploring the effect of different kinds of social 
support on different types of health outcomes. 
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. First, we introduce 
social media affordance based on social media and technology afford­
ance literature. Second, we clarify three primary kinds of social support 
for the self-management of chronic diseases in the context of social 
media. Third, we present our conceptual framework of social media- 
enabled healthcare by developing propositions for social media afford­
ance, social support, and health outcomes. Finally, implications, limi­
tations, and opportunities for future studies are discussed. 
2. Relevant literature 
2.1. Social media affordance 
Interactivity and social presence, two primary design features of 
social media, have facilitated users’ online collective action and social 
interactions, thus promoting social connectedness, information sharing, 
and collaboration among a large number of users on social media (Aral 
et al., 2013; Kaplan and Haenlein, 2010). Interactivity is generally 
considered to be a central characteristic of new media (McMillan, 2006), 
a core characteristic that empowers users to freely send, receive, and 
process user-generated content for use in the social media environment 
(Aula, 2010). Social presence is defined as “the salience of the other in a 
mediated communication and the consequent salience of their inter­
personal interactions” (Short et al., 1976, p. 65). In the context of social 
media, social presence allows users to connect with one another more

effectively by improving their connectedness and resolving ambiguity 
(Kaplan and Haenlein, 2010; Rettie, 2003). These two primary social 
media design functions play important roles in facilitating user inter­
action, thus creating an effective environment for user engagement in 
various aspects of social media. Therefore, social media design features 
have facilitated technology affordances that enable individuals to ach­
ieve their goals through user engagement on social media, referred to as 
social media affordances (Cabiddu et al., 2014; Majchrzak et al., 2013). 
Social media affordance aims to trigger user engagement, such as 
information sharing and user interactions, on social media (Cabiddu 
et al., 2014; Majchrzak et al., 2013). Some prior studies have identified 
several kinds of social media affordances in various research contexts. 
For example, Treem and Leonardi (2013) identified four social media 
affordances that can provide an enhanced understanding of how social 
media can affect organizational communication processes—namely, 
visibility, persistence, editability, and association. Visibility refers to 
“the ability to make their behaviors, knowledge, preferences, and 
communication network connections that were once invisible (or at 
least very hard to see) visible to others.” (Treem and Leonardi, 2013). 
Persistence refers to the ability to make the published content remain 
accessible in the same form as the original display. With editability, 
social media allow users to modify, improve information, and change 
collaboratively before presentation. Association is the technology 
capability of social media that allow users to create and sustain re­
lationships between individuals and between individuals and content, 
and they further identified two types of association including association 
between people and association between people and information. 
Majchrzak et al. (2013) theorized four social media affordances that 
represent ways to engage in knowledge conversations: metavoicing, 
triggered attending, network-informed associating, and generative 
role-taking. Metavoicing refers to “engaging in the ongoing online 
knowledge conversation by reacting online to others’ presence, profiles, 
content and activities” (p. 41). Triggered attending is “engaging in the 
online knowledge conversation by remaining uninvolved in content 
production or the conversation until a timely automated alert informs 
the individual of a change to the specific content of interest” (p. 42). 
Network-informed associating is defined as “engaging in the online 
knowledge conversation informed by relational and content ties” (p. 
44). Generative role-taking is engaging in the online knowledge con­
versation 
by 
enacting 
patterned 
actions 
and 
taking 
on 
community-sustaining roles in order to maintain a productive dialog 
among participants (p. 45). Cabiddu et al. (2014) identified three 
distinctive social media affordances that support customer engagement 
in tourism: persistent engagement, customized engagement, and trig­
gered engagement. In details, persistent engagement represents “the 
possibility of maintaining an ongoing dialog with customers, even when 
they are not physically at the property” (p. 185). Customized engage­
ment represents “the possibility of interacting with customers based on 
prior knowledge of individual-level information” (p. 185). Triggered 
engagement represents “the possibility of instigating customer encoun­
ters based on an external, customer-initiated event” (p. 185). 
Those studies have revealed that social media affordances improve 
user engagement via its features (e.g., information-sharing activities and 
user interactions), which then enable users to create values and acquire 
the resources they want. In this view, social media affordances are 
closely linked to opportunities of actions provided by the design and 
socialization features of social media (Bradner, 2001; Hsieh, 2012). 
Consistent with some prior studies (e.g., Volkoff and Strong, 2013, 
Strong et al., 2014, Volkoff and Strong, 2017, Evans et al., 2017), social 
media affordances emerge from the interaction between social media 
and users and explain how users can achieve specific goals via social 
media features. Similarly, Karahanna et al. (2018) suggested that social 
media features facilitate social media affordances, which allow users to 
generate outcomes. For example, Facebook features such as “sharing my 
own photo” and “updating my new status” can facilitate the 
self-presentation affordance. With that being said, the affordance 
perspective can be viewed a bridge between social media technical 
features and social impacts (Volkoff and Strong, 2013), and thus, it al­
lows us to explain how technologies can generate outcomes in a variety 
of research contexts (e.g., Leidner et al., 2018, Strong et al., 2014, Du 
et al., 2019). For example, Sæbø et al. (2020) found that social media can 
support people’s dynamic collective actions through a variety of affor­
dances, such as making decisions collectively and circulating informa­
tion. Following this logic, social media affordances allow us to study the 
interactions between social media and users and explain how users may 
take advantage of social media affordances to conduct self-management 
of chronic diseases and achieve health outcomes. 
Accordingly, in our study, we identify social media affordances based 
on social media features that can trigger online activities on social media 
in general (not a specific type of social media). The rationale is that 
patients may engage on a variety of social media platforms to maximize 
their opportunities to acquire resources for supporting their health de­
cisions and behaviors (Li et al., 2018). Therefore, it is important to 
develop new social media affordances that can deepen the understand­
ing of how patients use social media to support self-management of 
chronic diseases in the specific context of this study. The existing liter­
ature on social media affordances has not identified or conceptualized 
social media affordances in relation to healthcare from an individual 
patient perspective. For that reason, in this study, we further develop 
social media affordances based on the existing ones (see Appendix A), 
which reveal three key common features: collaboration on editing 
knowledge, interactions among users for socializing and developing 
close relationships, and learning from one another. Accordingly, in this 
study we have identified three types of social media affordances related 
to those common features: the affordance for community cocreation, the 
affordance for social relationships, and the affordance for social 
learning. These three social media affordances can be viewed as 
higher-order affordances that can be actualized from the basic affor­
dances identified in prior studies. For example, an affordance for com­
munity cocreation can be facilitated by ongoing conversations between 
patients (i.e., metavoicing) and collaboration. This is consistent with the 
work of Leidner et al. (2018), who suggested that first-order affordances 
can actualize second-order affordances. For example, in that study, the 
investigators found that interacting with peers and demonstrating 
leadership acted as first-order affordances to actualize building re­
lationships with peers as a second-order affordance. We have defined 
these three social media affordances in detail below. More specifically, 
for each social media affordance, we have identified the theoretical 
mechanisms through which these affordances could be formed in social 
media. 
2.1.1. Affordance for community co-creation 
Affordance for community co-creation provides users opportunities 
to co-create values with others to produce knowledge about a specific 
topic (Raja-Yusof et al., 2016; Zhao et al., 2013). This affordance cap­
tures how users can contribute their knowledge through engagement in 
conversations in social media such as online communities and online 
groups (Cabiddu et al., 2014; Majchrzak et al., 2013). A user can post 
questions, and many other users can review the questions and share 
their knowledge, ideas, and comments. Social media users can add 
knowledge to the content already posted, thus providing an enhanced 
understanding of a specific topic. This social media affordance mainly 
offers users the option of sharing content and collaborating to contribute 
knowledge that is available to other social media users. 
This affordance can capture the key elements of affordances identi­
fied in the previous literature, such as those from the collaboration of 
Zammuto et al. (2007) and Zhao et al. (2013), of collective affordance 
and shared affordance by Leonardi (2013), of metavoicing and genera­
tive role-taking by Majchrzak et al. (2013); and of the visibility, 
persistence, editability, and association between people and content by 
Treem and Leonardi (2013). These social media affordances can be 
viewed as basic affordances that actualize community cocreation as a

high-level affordance (Bygstad et al., 2016; Leidner et al., 2018). For 
example, metavoicing enables social media users to expand the 
dissemination of content shared in social media and add their own 
content, thus cocreating the content. Social media offer the users the 
possibility of giving their shared content visibility, making it possible for 
users to cocreate through the possibility of collaboration and to achieve 
collective understanding (i.e., shared affordance). 
In the healthcare domain, people can collaborate on producing 
knowledge about a specific disease, addressing health conditions, 
generating potential solutions, and referring treatments. Co-creation 
could happen in different forms through a variety of technology capa­
bilities and collaborations in a social media-based community (Zwass, 
2010; See-To and Ho, 2014; Füller, 2010). For instance, users have been 
actively participating in knowledge contribution activities, such as 
facilitating enhanced understanding of a specific concept on Wikipedia. 
In social media-enabled communities, users may work together on a 
specific issue and generate potential solutions based on user-generated 
content, reflecting the co-creation values. In addition, social media of­
fers social collective platforms that facilitate mass collaboration for 
sharing and creating knowledge (Pettersen, 2014). Facilitators to 
collaboration enable users to produce knowledge on social media, 
assisting with the formulation of social support. This process of com­
munity co-creation represents the way people create, modify, share, and 
discuss user-generated content on various social media platforms 
(Kietzmann et al., 2011). Therefore, community co-creation could well 
capture a primary affordance of social media, and it provides users the 
capability to participate in online activities such as contributing 
knowledge and exchanging resources (Raja-Yusof et al., 2016; Zhao 
et al., 2013). 
2.1.2. Affordance for social relationships 
Affordance for social relationships enables users to develop and 
maintain social relationships among individuals in social media. Social 
presence is considered an important design feature that makes social 
media a great venue where users may interact with others who have 
common interests (Kaplan and Haenlein, 2010; Aula, 2010). With this 
design feature, social media provides users with the capability to con­
nect to each other and facilitate social interaction (Treem and Leonardi, 
2013; Kane et al., 2009). In such a scenario, users can have opportunities 
to develop and maintain relationships with members of social 
media-based communities. Accordingly, the affordance for social re­
lationships largely depends on users’ interaction with others and so­
ciability in the social media environment. 
This affordance can be actualized from some existing affordances of 
social media that make it possible for users to develop and maintain 
social relationships therein. For example, social affordance is defined as 
“the relationship between the properties of an object and the social 
characteristics of a given group that enable particular kinds of interac­
tion among members of that group” (Bradner, 2001). Such interaction 
with peer members can make it possible for people to connect with 
others and build relationships. Similarly, customized engagement and 
triggered engagement (Cabiddu et al., 2014) can enhance interaction 
among peers in social media, which offers users the possibility of 
developing social relationships. Accordingly, social media offer users 
the possibility of developing social relationships through the possibility 
of associations between people and people (Treem and Leonardi, 2013), 
in other words, social ties (Boyd and Ellison, 2008). 
Therefore, affordance for social relationships could be made possible 
on various social media platforms that support social interactions among 
individuals, thus enabling them to exchange resources (Ellison et al., 
2009; Kaplan and Haenlein, 2010). For example, users may build social 
relationships and manage social ties on social networking sites such as 
Facebook and Twitter (Ellison et al., 2007; Madge et al., 2009; Boyd and 
Ellison, 2008). Empowered by social media design features, this 
affordance is popular among individuals engaged in bidirectional com­
munications and ongoing resources exchanges, which can create 
associations between people. 
2.1.3. Affordance for social learning 
Social learning theory posits that new patterns of behavior can be 
acquired by people through either direct experience with or observation 
of others’ behaviors, attitudes, and outcomes of the behaviors (Bandura 
and Walters, 1977). Social learning is a learning process involving 
people who observe the behavior of one another in a common envi­
ronment (Conte and Paolucci, 2001). This learning process can affect 
users’ behaviors. With their advanced design features, social media are 
online environments where people with common interests or concerns 
can interact with and learn from each other. For example, in social 
media health groups, people may discuss how they cope with health 
problems and overcome a disease, and others can observe and learn from 
the experience. Such observation can probably modify patients’ be­
haviors, thus generating improved health outcomes. Therefore, it is clear 
that social media empower users to learn from one another by observing 
others’ behaviors and the resultant outcomes. We name it the affordance 
for social learning, which mainly offers an individual user the option of 
interacting with others and learning from the experience-oriented con­
tent they shared. 
Prior studies provided evidence that users have been increasingly 
using social media platforms for individual learning purposes, and social 
media platforms have evolved into social learning platforms (Dabbagh 
and Kitsantas, 2012; McLoughlin and Lee, 2010). Social learning tasks 
are usually self-regulated tasks, but they are also part of a collective 
learning process; thus, social learning is learning from individuals’ re­
actions to different online resources. This social media affordance can be 
actualized from some basic affordances identified in prior studies, 
including individual affordance and collective affordance (Leonardi et al., 
2013). An individualized affordance is “an affordance that someone 
enacts when using a technology’s features” (Leonardi, 2013). A collec­
tive affordance is “an affordance that is collectively created by members 
of a group, in the aggregate, which allows the group to do something 
that it could not otherwise accomplish” (Leonardi, 2013). These two 
basic affordances make it possible for an individual to enhance their 
learning in a social media system. Social media provide resources 
generated by members of different groups, allowing an individual to 
learn from another person. In this way, the affordance of social learning 
can be also actualized by collaborative learning, which posits that in­
dividuals can learn from each other via sharing experiences within a 
collaborative group (Mitnik et al., 2009; Suthers, 2006). In such a state, 
social learning is a learning process that benefits from diverse members 
and the resources they share. Therefore, we propose that social learning 
can capture another primary social media affordance that provides op­
portunities and motivations for users to learn from each other 
collaboratively. 
2.1.4. Summary 
In summary, social media design features foster various social media 
affordances that enable users to achieve different goals by engaging in 
online activities and interacting with others. In this study, we have 
focused on social media affordances that offer users the opportunity to 
gain knowledge, develop and maintain social relationships, and learn 
from one another. We include three types of social media affordances in 
Table 1. 
2.2. Social support 
Social support refers to “information leading the subject to believe 
that he is cared for and loved, esteemed, and a member of a network of 
mutual obligations” (Cobb, 1976). It is formed by the exchange of re­
sources (i.e., verbal and nonverbal messages) between two or more in­
dividuals (Shumaker and Brownell, 1984). Social support could be 
facilitated by the transmission of information shared by individuals and 
the content of information determined by the type of social support. In

today’s information age, social media facilitates new channels for online 
information-sharing activities (Kaplan and Haenlein, 2010; Ransbo­
tham and Kane, 2011). People have been actively engaging on social 
media platforms, where they share, request, and acquire information to 
just have fun or address problems they have encountered. Social media 
has drastically changed people’s daily lives and provided innovative 
socially mediated channels for people to acquire useful information and 
meet their social needs. Therefore, social media offers a large amount of 
user-generated content and has become a popular venue where people 
can acquire social support. Through online information-sharing activ­
ities, social support is available through various social media platforms 
such as wikis, social networking sites, and online communities (e.g., Lin 
et al., 2016). 
Prior studies have paid much attention to the positive impact of so­
cial support on people’s health conditions and outcomes. Researchers 
have shown that social support benefits patients, including coping with 
stressful life events (Thoits, 1982), increased adherence to prescribed 
treatment regimens (McCorkle et al., 2008), and improved psychologi­
cal well-being (Cohen and Wills, 1985). In the self-management of 
chronic diseases, social support is especially important for promoting 
patients’ health behavior and achieving positive health outcomes. For 
example, McCorkle et al. (2008) found that social support increases 
people’s well-being and reduces psychiatric symptoms for people with 
serious mental illness. The findings of van Dam et al. (2005) also support 
the idea that social support has positive outcomes on diabetes control. A 
summary of the current literature on the consequences of social support 
(see Appendix B) reveals two underrepresented areas: (a) the different 
forms of social support and (b) the impacts of various forms of social 
support on different types of health outcomes. To close the research gaps 
and provide further insights, we have developed propositions that 
elaborate on how different forms of social support affect patients’ 
self-care and psychological health, and these proposition are essential 
for developing an enhanced understanding of the role of social support 
in the self-management of chronic diseases. To accomplish this goal, we 
first defined different forms of social support and types of health out­
comes, and we then developed propositions pertaining to the relation­
ships among them. 
Social support has generally been categorized into different forms 
such as informational support, emotional support, instrumental support, 
and companionship (Berkman et al., 2000; House, 1981). In the social 
media environment, informational support and emotional support are 
considered the most common types of social support for assisting with 
health-related decisions and improving health-related outcomes(e.g., 
Lin et al., 2016, Yan and Tan, 2014). In addition to these two types of 
social support, we are also interested in experiential support, which 
focuses on the exchange of direct experiences among patients who have 
similar health conditions. 
2.2.1. Informational support 
Informational support refers to the provision of knowledge in the 
transmission of health-related information such as disease knowledge, 
medical or treatment regimen, healthcare-related advice and referrals as 
well as other information that is useful for people to understand health- 
related topics. Social media offers a large amount of health-related in­
formation and knowledge posted by both healthcare professionals and 
nonprofessionals. Evidence suggests that social media has become an 
emerging means for patients to acquire informational support via the 
online health information exchange (Fox and Duggan, 2013; Boulos 
et al., 2007). From this perspective, informational support could be 
made possible for patients when shared health knowledge is accessible. 
For example, clinicians actively use social media to communicate 
with patients and answer their health-related questions by sharing 
concierge practice-oriented healthcare information and knowledge (Li 
et al., 2018). The clinician-generated content is usually viewed as 
instructional guidance by patients, particularly those with chronic dis­
eases, and it is helpful for patients to gain knowledge about the diseases, 
find potential solutions, and acquire advice. Further, this kind of 
user-generated content is usually viewed as the primary source of in­
formation for patients’ learning and health-related decision-making 
because clinicians possess the knowledge (Matthews et al., 2002). 
Having access to clinicians’ shared knowledge about chronic diseases, 
healthcare information, and treatment, patients could gain knowledge 
and better understand their health condition. Therefore, the trans­
mission of health-related information between patients and clinicians 
usually facilitates informational support because it enhances patients’ 
health-related knowledge. For another example, social media provides a 
wide variety of bidirectional communication tools that connect patients 
who have similar health concerns and provide a shared understanding of 
health information. Patients with similar health conditions create online 
forums and groups on social media platforms (e.g., Facebook and 
Twitter) to communicate with one another and share health-related 
information (Greene et al., 2011). Patients may share their healthcare 
knowledge and post reviews about health products, medicines, and 
doctors on social media platforms such as wikis, blogs, social networking

sites, collaborative tagging (folksonomies), and tag clouds (Boulos et al., 
2007), which are all great sources for them to observe informational 
support. The exchange of health-related information among patients 
also plays an important role in gaining knowledge, thus formulating 
informational support (Antheunis et al., 2013). Therefore, informational 
support can be facilitated via the exchange of knowledge between pa­
tients and clinicians as well as among patients and peers. In other words, 
both patients and clinicians can provide informational support in the 
context of social media. This is consistent with the work of Li et al. 
(2018), who suggested that social support can be enhanced through 
knowledge exchange among different stakeholders, including health 
care professionals and lay people. 
2.2.2. Experiential support 
Experiential support refers to support perceived in the exchange of 
individuals’ firsthand experience, including medical and treatment 
experience and experience coping with health problems as well as 
evidence-based health outcomes. Experiential support is generally 
considered to be a subtype of informational support (i.e., Yan and Tan, 
2014), and it is underrepresented in the current literature. Experiential 
support is more than someone providing health-related information and 
knowledge about diseases, but rather it involves someone providing 
firsthand insight into the process and experience of having a particular 
illness as well providing hope and serving as an example of someone in a 
similar situation who was able to overcome the disease (Snyder and 
Pearse, 2010). 
Unlike informational support, experiential support comes in the form 
of sharing patients’ firsthand experience about managing diseases or 
effective evidence-based healthcare outcomes. It provides true examples 
that demonstrate the effectiveness of medical treatments and therapy as 
well as the helpfulness of actions patients take to cope with illnesses. The 
basis for facilitating experiential support is the connections among pa­
tients who have a similar illness and could tell others what they went 
through, and they are the only persons who would be able to provide a 
certain kind of social support. In this way, patients can acquire experi­
ential support from other patients who have similar health conditions. 
Therefore, informational support and experiential support are clearly 
distinguished from each other in terms of the shared content and the 
persons who share information. Thus, in this study, we argue that 
experiential support is another primary type of social support made 
richer by social media, but it does not replace informational support. 
Social media creates an environment where patients who have 
similar health condition come Social media creates an environment 
where patients who have similar health conditions come together and 
share their experiences and health outcomes resulting from their health 
behaviors. In our research context, experiential support could be made 
possible on various platforms where people of similar health conditions 
can interact with each other and share their self-management experi­
ences. In such a group, patients would share their own experiences with 
others about how they cope with health concerns, what they do to 
overcome health issues, and the outcomes of their self-management 
strategy. In this view, social media provides both informational and 
experiential support that assists patients’ self-management of diseases, 
aiming ‘‘to reduce uncertainty regarding health status’’ and ‘‘construct a 
social and personal (cognitive) sense of health’’ (Tardy and Hale, 1998, 
p. 338). Experiential support is valuable because it provides 
evidence-oriented information and knowledge for patients to follow, 
thus encouraging them to continue with their treatment therapies. For 
example, Facebook provides a great platform for patients to share their 
personal experiences with people living with similar chronic diseases 
(Greene et al., 2011). Thus, social media becomes an attractive resource 
for patients to exchange experiential support. 
2.2.3. Emotional support 
Emotional support is another primary type of social support that 
patients seek to obtain on social media, and it comes in the form of 
“sharing happiness or sadness or of expressing caring and concern” (Yan 
and Tan, 2014). More specifically, this kind of social support could be 
obtained by patients through the expression of care, empathy, under­
standing, trust, respect, and even love between individuals aiming to 
express care and concern to one another. Social media facilitates a 
supportive and interactive environment for patients to communicate 
with others who have similar health conditions, and it offers great op­
portunities for them to talk with and help each other and to develop 
trusting relationships (Bambina, 2007; Nambisan, 2011; Yan et al., 
2015). For example, Facebook has become a venue for patients with 
chronic diseases to develop an emotionally supportive community 
(Greene et al., 2011). Social media makes it easy for patients to find 
others with similar health conditions who can understand them and 
provide emotional support. Social media makes it possible for patients to 
reach out to the right person and communicate their true feelings 
through the self-management process. In such a group, patients would 
be eager to share personal feelings and express their emotional concerns 
as well as to provide feedback to others’ mood-related posts, thus 
releasing themselves from being alone in the long-term self-manage­
ment of chronic diseases (Bender et al., 2011; Swan, 2009). Further, 
with the development of trusting social relationships in the group, pa­
tients may also feel caring and concern, thus observing emotional sup­
port (Cobb, 1976). 
Similarly, social media provides an alternative channel for patients 
to connect with their family members and friends, who are more likely 
to express care and concern. When patients feel blue, they may express 
their emotions on their social networking accounts. Their significant 
others may express care and concern by responding to the posts and 
encouraging them. In this way, patients are likely to receive emotional 
support from their family members and friends (Snyder and Pearse, 
2010). Therefore, an individual patient can acquire emotional support 
from family members, friends, and other patients. 
2.2.4. Summary 
In summary, patients can obtain informational support, experiential 
support, and emotional support depending on the content of the infor­
mation and the people they share the information with on social media. 
Patients could acquire informational support from knowledge-featured 
information shared by both professional and nonprofessional health­
care workers. In contrast, experiential support could be acquired from 
the experience-oriented information shared by people who live with 
similar health conditions and who have experience dealing with health- 
related problems. Lastly, patients may receive emotional support from 
information provided by family members, friends, and other patients 
who have expressed care and concern. Nowadays, people are increas­
ingly active on social media, exchanging various kinds of information 
and fostering different types of social support, because social media 
overcomes geographic and temporal boundaries of user communications 
and interaction. In Table 2 we have provided a summary of informa­
tional support, experiential support, and emotional support. 
In addition, previous studies have suggested that patients could ac­
quire social support through both seeking information and providing 
information activities (Phang et al., 2009). In a more recent study, Yan 
and Tan (2014) measured social support through two primary activities: 
giving and receiving social support, both of which were found to have 
positively influenced patients’ health. Those studies confirm that social 
support can be obtained in both seeking and giving activities. Therefore, 
in this study, social support means the support patients obtain in both 
giving and receiving activities. When patients engage in the giving 
support activities, they may also receive social support simultaneously 
because they could learn from each other, which is considered passive 
receiving support. Both actively seeking and giving actives activities 
help people obtain social support on social media, which indicates that 
support given and received is likely to be formed at the same time in 
relation to online activities.

2.3. Health behavior and outcomes 
Clearly, self-management is essential for patients living with chronic 
diseases to achieve better health outcomes and to improve their quality 
of life (Lorig et al., 1999; Barlow et al., 2002; Holman and Lorig, 2004). 
Patients need to gain skills and self-confidence to better manage their 
health conditions in the long-term treatment of chronic disease because 
the self-management of chronic diseases generally involves daily 
self-care behaviors to reduce or control the diseases’ symptoms and to 
cope with the psychosocial problems. Patients can improve their phys­
ical health through the self-care behavioral process and the psycholog­
ical process (Clark et al., 1991; Uchino, 2006). Therefore, 
self-management is essential for patients’ overall well-being. Barlow 
et al. (2002) referred to self-management as “the individual’s ability to 
manage the symptoms, treatment, physical and psychological conse­
quences and life styles changes inherent in living with a chronic con­
dition” (p. 178). Further, Clark et al. (2014) posited that the ability of an 
individual 
to 
achieve 
desired 
goals 
of 
self-management 
is 
self-regulating, and patients would need to effectively manage their 
diseases according to their health conditions. In such a state, effective 
self-management depends on a patient’s cognitive understanding of and 
emotional responses to a chronic condition as well as the use of health 
behaviors to cope with the disease’s symptoms and psychological 
problems. In this view, we conclude that successful self-management of 
a chronic disease requires a patient to possess the sufficient self-care 
habits and psychological well-being that are essential for improved 
physical health outcomes. 
2.3.1. Self-Care behavior 
Self-care is essential for patients to cope with chronic conditions, and 
patients usually struggle to carry out day-to-day tasks with clinicians’ 
guidelines for controlling disease symptoms over the long term. Self-care 
is a key form of care for patients living with chronic diseases, and it 
requires individual effort to perform the tasks recommended by clini­
cians, which typically consist of various actions done in compliance with 
a prescribed treatment regimen such as medicine adherence. Those 
health habits play an important role in controlling the chronic diseases’ 
symptom (Clark et al., 2014). For example, self-care for diabetes may 
involve a range of activities such as following a diet low in saturated fat, 
adhering to a strict medication regimen, regularly self-testing blood 
glucose, and exercising on a daily basis (Toobert et al., 2000; Norris 
et al., 2001). Patients’ commitment to self-care is helpful for controlling 
diabetes and achieving better health conditions. Self-care is a function of 
a patient’s “subject value of an outcome and the subjective probability 
(or ‘expectation’) that a particular action will achieve that outcome” 
(Rosenstock et al., 1988). Patients’ self-care can be enhanced by their 
understanding of health conditions and solutions as well as expected 
health outcomes (Bandura, 2004), and it is a continuously 
self-regulating process that can be learned through cognitive responses 
(Barlow et al., 2002; Clark and Dodge, 1999; Clark et al., 2014). 
Therefore, we conclude that self-care is the care of an individual in a 
cognitive sense and could change along with his or her gained knowl­
edge about health problems and solutions. 
2.3.2. Psychological well-being 
Psychological well-being has been considered to be another key 
factor that determines the success of self-management of chronic dis­
eases (Barlow et al., 2002; Uchino, 2006; Uchino, 2009). It is usually 
represented by patients’ emotional responses to chronic health condi­
tions and self-beliefs, such as feelings of control, self-esteem, self-­
efficacy, stress, and anxiety (Cohen, 1988; Cohen and Wills, 1985). 
There is an emotional cost to long-term treatment because a consider­
able proportion of patients with chronic conditions can have affective 
disorders such as low mood, distress, depression, and anxiety (Zabora 
et al., 2001; Linden et al., 2012). It can be difficult to diagnose and 
address psychological problems; thus, psychological problems can be a 
significant barrier to the achievement of the optimal psychic outcomes 
(Turner and Kelly, 2000). Therefore, it is essential for patients to 
maintain a healthy psychological state during long-term treatment 
(Aalto et al., 1997; Van der Ven et al., 2003), and psychological care can 
be an effective intervention to produce optimal moods and reduce psy­
chological distress (Turner et al., 2011). Therefore, we conclude that 
psychological well-being captures individuals’ emotional reactions to 
health conditions through moods and self-beliefs, thus playing an 
important role in achieving optimal psychic health. 
2.3.3. Physical health 
Physical health, which is critical for patients’ overall well-being, can 
be measured in a variety of ways, including the disease symptoms, 
clinical outcomes, and disease-related morbidity and mortality (Berk­
man et al., 2000; Uchino, 2004; Uchino, 2006). To improve physical 
health outcomes, patients struggle to control their disease symptoms and 
improve their clinical outcomes. For example, diabetic patients may 
want to reduce HgbA1C levels and maintain a low blood sugar level 
through a strict medicine regimen and healthy diet(Norris et al., 2001). 
Patients living with chronic health conditions can have a high risk of 
disease-related morbidity and mortality (e.g., Johnson et al., 2014). 
Therefore, physical health outcomes can include disease-related symp­
toms and their consequences. 
2.3.4. Summary 
Based on the above discussion, it is clear that self-care, psychosocial

status, and physical health outcomes are essential for successful self- 
management of chronic diseases. The objective of our study is not to 
replicate the relationships among those three components, but to elab­
orate how various forms of social support are linked to health outcomes. 
The existing literature provides substantial evidence that social 
support generates beneficial effects on health and well-being, including 
physical health outcomes (Berkman et al., 2000; Uchino, 2009) and 
psychological health outcomes (Lakey and Orehek, 2011; Cohen and 
Wills, 1985). Drawing on the different theoretical perspectives, Uchino 
(2006) outlined two pathways—physiological and behavioral—to 
explain the influence of social support on physical health (i.e., morbidity 
and mortality); these pathways promote changes in biological profiles 
such as cardiovascular, neuroendocrine, and immune system function. 
Specifically, Uchino explained how structural and functional measures 
of support may ultimately influence disease morbidity and mortality via 
(a) behavioral processes involving health behaviors and adherence to 
medical regimens and (b) psychological processes such as appraisals and 
moods linked to emotional well-being. Social support has been 
demonstrated to promote health behaviors and improve psychological 
well-being. In addition, social support may lead to better psychic health 
via both cognitive processes, such as patients’ self-care behavior 
(DiMatteo, 2004; Uchino, 2009) and affective processes, such as a psy­
chological statement (Barrera Jr, 2000; Cohen, 1988) and mental health 
(Lakey and Orehek, 2011). In a more recent study, Uchino explained the 
impact of social support on physical health outcomes by highlighting the 
factors that develop social support and their influence on mechanisms 
such as effective coping and health behaviors (Uchino, 2009). All those 
studies support the idea that social support is related to physical health 
via both health behavioral processes and psychological processes. 
3. Propositions 
3.1. The effect of affordance for community co-creation 
Affordance for community co-creation empowers patients to co- 
create knowledge with others by contributing their understanding, dis­
cussing health-related issues, and exchanging opinions about treatment 
regimens. This kind of social media affordance offers great opportunities 
for patients to gain disease-specific knowledge and awareness of its 
relevant medical treatments, which serves as the base for informational 
support for self-management of chronic diseases. Briefly, it represents 
how patients may gain enhanced understanding of disease-specific 
health-related issues and the ways they cope with health concerns. It 
is particularly important for patients living with chronic diseases to gain 
enough knowledge to self-manage chronic diseases. 
With affordance for community co-creation, people may contribute 
to productive knowledge by focusing on those parts they have interest or 
expertise in, thus reducing the effort to co-create with others to develop 
knowledge about a specific disease on social media. Community co- 
creation may also encourage more people to engage in ongoing con­
versations by inputting knowledge from different perspectives. For 
example, a patient may post a question about his or her health concerns, 
and many other users may respond and contribute their knowledge, 
ideas, and advice. Those responders could be healthcare professionals 
providing knowledge about the disease and successful medical regi­
mens, or they could be patients providing their understanding of the 
disease and sharing personal narratives. As such, community co-creation 
fosters the exchange of knowledge among a large group of diverse users, 
who could provide information and knowledge in different ways. 
Therefore, community co-creation may motivate people to productively 
engage in online collaboration on the development of useful knowledge 
and information, which would facilitate different forms of social sup­
port. In the healthcare domain, cross-disciplinary users collaborate and 
work on specific health-related problems, providing high-quality infor­
mation and knowledge to the community for solutions (Adams, 2014; 
Celi et al., 2014). Taking advantage of community co-creation, many 
health communities on social media contain a considerable amount of 
patient- and expert-contributed healthcare information. In this view, 
community co-creation empowers patients to collect the health infor­
mation and knowledge they need from social media. In the transmission 
of user-generated content on social media, patients would understand 
their health condition better and gain relevant knowledge about medical 
treatments, healthcare advice, and referrals, thus obtaining informa­
tional support. 
With a stronger community co-creation norm in the context of social 
media, patients would have more opportunities to receive social support 
in different forms to assist with their self-management of diseases. An 
example of the impact of co-creation on the exchange of different forms 
of social support is online health groups on social media platforms such 
as Facebook and Twitter, which allow users to co-create with others who 
have similar health conditions by inputting their health-related knowl­
edge and by sharing opinions (Greene et al., 2011), all of which provide 
deep understanding about health-related issues. Community co-creation 
increases the effectiveness of knowledge exchange among individuals; 
therefore, we argue that social media community co-creation affordance 
would encourage people to engage in knowledge-sharing activities, thus 
facilitating informational support on social media. 
Proposition 1a. Affordance for co-creation mainly facilitates informa­
tional support on social media.1 
3.2. The effect of affordance for social learning 
As noted in the earlier discussion about the affordance for social 
learning, it offers patients the ability to learn from one another by 
virtually observing others’ experiences of coping with health issues and 
generating evidence-based outcomes. It is common to see people share 
their personal medical histories and disease self-management experi­
ences on social media platforms such as Facebook and in online 
healthcare communities (Snyder and Pearse, 2010; Yan and Tan, 2014). 
By discussing their personal experience, patients would learn about 
effective self-management and approved treatment regimens. This kind 
of social media affordance paves the way for patients to learn how to 
self-manage their illnesses from one another. With this kind of social 
media affordance, patients would be eager to share their experiences 
with and to help each other, which is the base for experiential support in 
social media. 
Social learning is an individual learning process that encourages 
people to engage in ongoing, interactive conversations with users who 
have similar conditions in a specific environment. With this kind of 
social media affordance, patients would have access to rich user- 
generated content featuring individual experiences about self- 
management of diseases. Meanwhile, patients who are aware that 
experience sharing would be useful for others would be more likely to 
share their experiences. Social media features provide users with the 
capability to connect to others living with similar health conditions and 
to seek support for approved medical regimens and self-management 
activities for achieving better health outcomes. People with 
experience-oriented shared information trigger social learning behav­
iors on social media. Patient-driven experiential support is invaluable 
for people seeking to update their knowledge and gain further insights 
for coping with health concerns (Jadad et al., 2000). In addition, rela­
tional ties are useful for people seeking to share their personal experi­
ences and express care for each other. As such, social media may trigger 
those social behaviors and foster experiential support with this social 
media-enabled affordance for social learning. In this view, the afford­
ance for social learning pervades social media with an innovative 
social-learning system where patients can perceive rich experiential

media affordance can facilitate a particular aspect of social support. This will be 
applied to Propositions 1b and 1c.

support facilitated by experience-oriented information sharing. 
Proposition 1b. Affordance for social learning mainly facilitates experi­
ential support on social media. 
3.3. The effect of affordance for social relationships 
Affordance for social relationships offers patients the opportunity to 
socialize and maintain social relationships on social media. Emotional 
support is an important type of social support that users acquire on so­
cial media, and it is mainly fostered by users’ social ties in a social media 
community(Lin et al., 2016; Yan and Tan, 2014). With this social media 
affordance, it is much easier than ever before for patients to develop 
social relationships on line. Briefly, this social media affordance repre­
sents how patients acquire emotional support for self-management of 
chronic diseases. 
It is common for patients to share their personal feelings and moods 
in their personal accounts on platforms such as Facebook and to receive 
emotional support from their “friends” (Greene et al., 2011). Patients 
may also acquire forms of emotional support such as understanding, 
encouragement, affirmation, sympathy, care, and concern from other 
patients in the online healthcare community (Yan and Tan, 2014). Social 
networks and relationships among individuals largely determine pa­
tients’ willingness to talk to someone else about their concerns, feelings, 
and moods; thus, they are beneficial in accessing emotional support on 
social media. Unlike with offline spaces, social media enables patients to 
overcome geographic boundaries and to meet various patients with 
similar diseases who are willing to talk about their struggles with 
self-management to overcome health concerns. In this review, the 
affordance for social relationships makes social media a great venue for 
patients to develop a social relationship with someone who is willing to 
exchange mood- or feeling-oriented information and to encourage 
others to persist with their self-management regimen. Simultaneously, 
patients may also feel being valued and taken care of by others on social 
media, thus leading to emotional support (Bambina, 2007; Bloom et al., 
2001). 
In addition, with this kind of social media affordance, patients would 
be able to develop trusting social relationships with other patients 
through their social interactions on social media (Cabiddu et al., 2014; 
Majchrzak et al., 2013; Bradner, 2001; Zhao et al., 2013). When patients 
have good social relationships with other patients with similar health 
conditions, they are willing to talk to each other about their personal 
feelings and emotional states. In such a scenario, emotional support 
could be obtained by patients because they have more people with 
whom to talk about their disease self-management and true feelings. 
Therefore, with this affordance, patients are likely to actively engage 
with and talk to someone else, thus achieving emotional support. In 
addition, the affordance for social relationships enhances interactions 
among patients and fosters the construction of a social network on social 
media. When people have better relationships, they are more willing to 
talk about their personal moods and feelings as well as express their 
concerns and care to others. Therefore, we propose the following: 
Proposition 1c. Affordance for social relationships mainly facilitates 
emotional support on social media. 
3.4. The effect of informational support 
As discussed above, informational support is beneficial to patients 
gaining health-related knowledge, which can provide them with a better 
understanding of their health conditions and effective medical or sur­
gical treatments. In this view, informational support can affect patients’ 
outcomes of self-management of chronic diseases through the knowl­
edge gained in the exchange process. We primarily developed proposi­
tions from social cognitive theory, which posits that an individual’s 
knowledge acquisition can depend on observing others engaged in 
relevant activities such as social interactions and social exchange 
(Bandura, 2001). This theory can be used to understand people’s health 
decisions and behaviors. Bandura (2004) states that “specifies a core set 
of determinants, the mechanism through which they work, and the 
optimal ways of translating this knowledge into effective health prac­
tices” (p. 144). As one of the core determinants, knowledge of health 
risks and benefits of different health practices can create the precondi­
tion for a change in patients’ health behaviors. In social media, patients 
have more channels than ever to exchange health information with 
other patients, fostering their understanding of health-related issues and 
potential health solutions. As such, in the exchange of informational 
support, patients gain knowledge of both health risks and health bene­
fits, thereby leading to a better understanding of the effectiveness of 
heath practices and health habits and promoting a willingness to adhere 
to treatment regimens and self-care behaviors (DiMatteo, 2004; 
McMullan, 2006; Kassirer, 2000). 
In addition, informational support benefits patients coping with 
uncertainty by promoting their self-care (Bandura, 2004; Yan and Tan, 
2014). According to social cognitive theory, patients can acquire 
knowledge and gain further insights into how to improve the long-term 
management of chronic diseases via the activity of the informational 
support exchange. In this view, informational support can play an 
important role to promote self-care behavior in the process of 
self-managing chronic diseases. 
Proposition 2a. Informational support in social media promotes self-care 
behavior. 
In addition, informational support can also generate positive psy­
chological health outcomes (Uchino, 2006; Uchino, 2009). Self-efficacy, 
as another core determinant of health promotion, is the belief that “one 
can exercise over one’s health habits” (Bandura, 2004). People of high 
self-efficacy are more confident when facing difficulties than those of 
low self-efficacy, and they are more likely to remain in a healthy psy­
chological state during the self-management process. In our research 
context, the knowledge gained from the exchange of information sup­
port can help patients better understand health concerns, locate various 
informational resources about effective treatments, and track their 
self-management progress. With access to the vast wealth of shared 
health knowledge on social media, patients can have a high self-efficacy 
belief and become confident about controlling their disease. By 
becoming knowledgeable about the possible solutions of health con­
cerns, patients could perceive self-efficacy for controlling their health 
problems and develop a positive belief in the self-management process 
(Bandura, 2004). Patients are generally in a healthy psychological state 
when they gain more knowledge about effective treatments and their 
benefits in the exchange of information support. Further, informational 
support such as advice and suggestions can also make patients feel less 
stressed and avoid other health-related risks, thus improving their 
emotional moods and minimizing stress in the long-term management of 
chronic diseases(Cohen, 1988), which also leads to better psychological 
health. 
Proposition 2b. Informational support in social media has a significant 
effect on psychological health. 
3.5. The effect of experiential support 
Experiential support is a kind of social support perceived by patients 
when they exchange individuals’ firsthand experience about coping 
with health-related problems and effective medical or surgical treat­
ments. In the context of social media, patients have access to experi­
ential support through a variety of platforms such as discussion forums 
and online communities, where patients exchange their personal expe­
riences with others who have similar health conditions. We drew pri­
marily on the observational learning theory to develop the propositions. 
The observational learning theory posits that individuals may change 
their own behaviors or learn or replicate new behaviors by observing 
others’ behaviors and considering their consequences (Bandura et al., 
1966; Bandura and Walters, 1977). Because of the popularity of web 
technology, patients have been increasingly engaging in the experiential

information exchange and starting to realize the value of experiential 
support when coping with health-related problems (Ziebland et al., 
2004; Snyder and Pearse, 2010). The gained experiential information 
from others can provide a greater understanding of the expected costs 
and benefits of health behaviors; as a result, it can foster the outcome 
expectations that promote self-care (Bandura, 2004). Social media has 
opened networks for patients with similar health conditions to exchange 
experiential information, which fosters evidence-based knowledge and 
assists with self-management. For example, patients can share their 
experiences about self-management and provide evidence-based 
knowledge to help other members in online healthcare communities 
(Yan et al., 2015). The knowledge gained from other patients’ experi­
ences can provide a greater understanding of health-related issues and 
solutions. Further, the firsthand experiences shared by patients are more 
valuable and trustworthy than those from other stakeholders because 
they can provide evidence-based health practices and health outcomes. 
In such a scenario, patients pay attention to others’ behavior and 
recognize its consequences, thus motivating their own self-care. There­
fore, experiential support promotes patients’ self-care through obser­
vation of others’ behavior and the comprehension of its outcomes. 
Proposition 3. Experiential support in social media promotes self-care 
behavior. 
3.6. The effect of emotional support 
In the long-term self-management process of chronic diseases, stress 
is often a massive barrier to the achievement of positive health outcomes 
because patients suffer from various symptoms and feel depressed at 
times (Davidson and Demaray, 2007; Thoits, 1995). Emotional support 
is especially important for helping patients to reduce stress and feel 
relief because they may experience happiness, relaxation, and mean­
ingfulness in the exchange of emotional support. We developed the 
propositions from the affective process perspective (Mischel and Shoda, 
1995). The affective process posits that individuals’ feelings and 
emotional reactions to situations are related to their attitude and beliefs. 
In the social media environment, emotional support is the foundation on 
which patients have affective responses to themselves and others who 
engage in the exchange process. For example, in the online healthcare 
community, patients exchange their emotions, such as happiness about 
successfully coping with health concerns, and moods, such as feeling 
good, both of which can be seen as affective responses. In addition, 
patients’ self-esteem, self-efficacy, and feeling of control are helpful for 
patients to maintain a positive psychological perspective by reducing 
stress (Cohen, 1988; Uchino, 2009). In this view, emotional support 
makes patients not feel alone and feel cared for, which is helpful for 
alleviating blue moods (Yan and Tan, 2014). Meanwhile, patients can 
also develop and maintain trusting social relationships in such a group 
through affective responses for each other. With strong emotional sup­
port on social media, patients can build social relationships and 
encourage each other when they are in blue moods, thus reducing stress 
and improving their psychological states (e.g., Nabi et al., 2013). 
Proposition 4. Emotional support in social media has a significant effect 
on psychological health. 
3.7. The effects of self-care behavior and psychological health 
We have realized that physical health can be achieved through two 
pathways: behavioral processes and psychological processes (Uchino, 
2006; Uchino, 2009; Cohen, 1988; Cohen and Wills, 1985). Behavioral 
processes are linked to health behaviors and treatment adherence, and 
psychological processes are linked to emotions, moods, feelings of 
control, and self-beliefs. Adherence to a self-care regimen can produce a 
high adherence to medical treatment and health habits, which can exert 
biological processes and lead to psychic health (Uchino, 2006). A high 
adherence can exert an influence on physical health because it can 
control the disease’s symptoms and improve biological functions. 
Therefore, a commitment to self-care is linked to physical health. 
In addition, patients with better psychological health could have a 
stronger feeling of control and healthier mood, which may improve 
physical health (Clark and Dodge, 1999; Uchino, 2004; Uchino, 2006). 
For example, psychological distress can lead to glucocorticoid resistance 
or worsen the disease’s symptoms (Miller et al., 2002). Maintaining a 
healthy psychological state can help patients control the disease symp­
toms more easily and reduce the risk of morbidity and mortality. 
Consistent with those studies, we posit that self-care and psychological 
health are both linked to physical health. 
Proposition 5a. Self-care behavior is linked to physical health. 
Proposition 5b. Psychological health is linked to physical health. 
In summary, Fig. 1 shows the conceptual framework whereby social 
media affordances foster social support and social support affects pa­
tients’ self-care and psychological health, both of which are linked to 
physical health in the domain of social media-enabled healthcare. More 
specifically, different social media affordances facilitate different forms 
of social support. Further, different forms of social support are linked to 
self-care and psychological health: (a) informational support promotes 
self-care behavior and improves psychological well-being, (b) experi­
ential support is linked to self-care behavior, and (c) emotional support 
is linked to psychological health. This theoretically grounded research 
uncovers the importance of social media effectiveness in patients’ self- 
care of diseases and demonstrates the process of social media usage in 
affecting patients’ health behaviors and health outcomes. 
4. Discussion 
The existing literature provides substantial evidence that social 
media is a novel technology for changing health practice (e.g., Fichman 
et al., 2011). However, few studies have attempted to provide an un­
derstanding about how social media could be adopted for 
self-management of chronic diseases by patients. In this paper, we 
intend to fill this gap by proposing a conceptual framework that explains 
the application of social media in healthcare from a patient’s perspec­
tive. Our work reveals an emerging theme of social media-enabled 
healthcare that theorizes social media-enabled social support from a 
technology affordance perspective and explicates its links to self-care 
and health conditions in the self-management of chronic diseases. It 
also responds to the recent call for research on the implications of social 
media in the healthcare domain (Fichman et al., 2011) and is among the 
first studies to offer insights into this new phenomenon. Our conceptual 
framework demonstrates how newly emerged web technology (here, 
social media) may create new values by leveraging it to our specific 
research context—namely, self-management of chronic diseases. 
Our work is novel and different from previous studies in the 
following aspects. First, we tailor social media affordances to healthcare 
and elaborate how those affordances can facilitate different types of 
social support. Social media affordances are essential for user engage­
ment in social media (e.g., Cabiddu et al., 2014), and thus serve a theory 
for explaining how patients can perceive social support for 
self-management. Second, unlike previous studies examining the in­
fluences of social support as a general process, our work explicitly ex­
plains how a particular type of social support is linked to a particular 
type of health outcome. Thus, our propositions could serve as a foun­
dation to stimulate future research and pave the way to study the phe­
nomenon of social media-enabled healthcare. More specifically, our 
propositions could help to extend and expand technology affordance 
theory and social support theory to new research contexts such as 
technology-based healthcare. Below, we discuss the theoretical and 
practical contributions of our study.

4.1. Theoretical contributions 
4.1.1. Advancing social media-enabled healthcare with social media 
affordance 
Our work suggests that the affordances social media provide are 
essential in driving patients’ engagement in the exchange of resources 
online. Technology affordances, in general, refer to “the mutuality of 
actor intentions and technology capabilities that provide the potential 
for a particular action (Majchrzak et al., 2013). In our work, social media 
affordances refer to the capabilities that social media provide to patients 
and enable them to offer and receive social support. More specifically, 
social media affordances empower patients and encourages them to 
engage in an online social support exchange (Cabiddu et al., 2014; Vaast 
and Kaganer, 2013). We identified and distinguished three types of so­
cial media affordances from a patient’s perspective: affordance for 
co-creation, affordance for social learning, and affordance for social 
relationships. These social media affordances enable patients to 
co-create on producing health-related knowledge, observe learning from 
others’ experiences, and develop and maintain social relationships for 
the self-management of chronic diseases. Our work advances the liter­
ature in the arena of social media-enabled healthcare by identifying and 
developing the three primary social media affordances, tailoring them to 
the self-management of diseases in the domain of social media-enabled 
healthcare, and proposing effects of specific affordances on specific 
types of social support that is provided online by the community of 
patients and providers. 
4.1.2. Advancing social media-enabled healthcare with online social 
support 
We advance the literature on social media-enabled healthcare by 
reifying the three types of social support discussed in the literature and 
by introducing new relationships between different types of online so­
cial support and health behaviors and outcomes. Social support is a 
multidimensional construct and could consist of various kinds of social 
support (Berkman et al., 2000; Cobb, 1976; House, 1981). The literature 
that focuses on exploring different consequences of various kinds of 
social support is limited. Our work fills in this research gap by clarifying 
three primary social supports in social media for self-management of 
chronic diseases: informational support, experiential support, and 
emotional support. Consistent with the prior studies, our work posits 
that informational support and emotional support are linked to health 
conditions in general. However, we deliberately explored the different 
impacts of these three kinds of social support on self-care and psycho­
logical health. Below, we discuss how our work advances social support 
theory. 
Informational support significantly increases patients’ knowledge 
about health problems, health risk and benefits, and possible health 
solutions, which promote self-care and psychological health via the 
cognitive process. Emotional support improves patients’ emotional 
states and moods through their emotional reactions to one another on 
social media. Social media makes the world smaller for patients who 
share a common illness, allowing them to get together and encourage 
each other during the long-term self-management of chronic diseases. 
Patients would have better psychological health because of this kind of 
social support. Unlike some prior studies that posited that information 
and emotional support influence health outcomes (i.e.Yan and Tan, 
2014) or social support, in general, and have an impact on patients’ 
health behavior and health outcomes (i.e., Uchino, 2006, Uchino, 2009), 
our work uncovers new relationships: (a) information support is linked 
to self-care behavior and psychological health; and (b) emotional sup­
port is mainly linked to psychological health. As such, our work con­
tributes to advancing social support theory by revisiting its dimensions 
and exploring its different effects. These propositions are important for 
the implications of social support theory in new research contexts. 
Further, we introduce experiential support as a new dimension of 
social support and distinguish it from informational support because the 
nature of social media empowers patients to exchange health-related 
resources with multiple stakeholders. Informational support could be 
fostered when patients exchange health-related resources with stake­
holders such as doctors and patients on social media. It offers knowledge 
about health-related topics. Experiential support, however, offers 
evidence-based knowledge with the experience exchange process among 
patients who have similar illnesses. Experiential support focuses on 
patients’ firsthand experience in relation to their self-management of 
chronic diseases and sharing. Although prior studies have made expe­
rience exchange a subtype of informational support, our work pulled it 
out and conceptualized it as a new social support. This argument is also 
supported by social cognitive theory and observational theory that 
informational support tends to influence behavior from the cognitive 
process (Bandura, 2004), whereas experiential support may affect 
behavior via the observational learning process (Bandura et al., 1966; 
Bandura and Walters, 1977). Experiential support is particularly 
important for the self-management of chronic diseases and the 
improvement of patients’ performance with regard to self-care. In 
addition, we introduce the interaction effect of those two kinds of social 
support on self-care behavior: the effect of informational support would 
be less effective if there is strong experiential support. 
In summary, our work enriches social support theory by exploring 
Fig. 1. Conceptual Framework.

types of social support for self-management of chronic diseases and 
developing propositions based on each type of social support. As our 
propositions illustrate, social media affordances allow patients to 
observe rich social support in online activities and achieve better 
physical health via both self-care behavior and psychological health 
processes. We hope our propositions encourage scholars to revisit social 
support and apply it to new research contexts. 
4.2. Practical implications 
Our work offers insights into social media affordances that allow 
patients to exchange social support. With enhanced understanding of 
social media affordances, social media providers might be able to 
improve design features to facilitate various kinds of affordances and 
better alter various types of social support. Consequently, our concep­
tual framework can inform practitioners seeking to influence patients’ 
health habits and improve their health outcomes. For example, given 
that the affordance for co-creation fosters rich informational support in 
social media, social media providers should create a user-friendly 
environment where people would be encouraged to co-create and 
contribute their knowledge. Thus, understanding the effects of different 
types of social media affordances can help social media providers better 
design their platforms and engage their users. This process also helps 
social media providers retain existing membership and attract new 
users, which is essential to success. In addition, our work offers impor­
tant implications for healthcare practices. By understanding the various 
types of social support, healthcare providers could effectively engage 
patients on social media and provide effective services based on pa­
tients’ needs. 
4.3. Limitation and future directions 
Our work opens a new research area. Future research would refine 
and validate the model in different empirical settings. The primary 
objective of this work is to articulate a conceptual framework that would 
provide some basic guidelines to enable future researchers to take the 
first step toward validating the proposed model and generalizing its 
findings. Our study also has some limitations that could lead to future 
research directions. The first limitation concerns the type of chronic 
disease. Our work does not deliberately explore various types of chronic 
diseases that may require different levels of self-care in the self- 
management process. It is possible that our conceptual model may be 
better applied to some types of chronic diseases than others. Further 
studies can extend our work by advancing it to different types of chronic 
diseases such as diabetes and cancer. Second, our study context is gen­
eral social media tools, and it is not specific to a particular social media 
platform. Design features can vary based on different social media 
platforms, so the three kinds of social media affordances identified in 
this study may or may not be representative of a specific platform. 
Future studies may attempt to develop new affordances based on the 
design features of specific platforms. In addition, the diversity and 
richness of social support may vary across different social media plat­
forms. Future research can build on our conceptual framework by 
testing in only a specific social media platform. Future studies may also 
attempt to explore the application of enterprise social media for health 
care practices. Future studies may also pay attention to the negative 
impacts of social media use on health outcomes (e.g., adherence to 
treatment) because social media can also convey fake news and spread 
negative emotions.2

Urbanization is intensifying in cities, accompanied by burgeoning inequalities, notably in the healthcare sector. 
Limited research offers a granular examination of healthcare resource accessibility across diverse population 
groups. In this study, we employ census data from all 6164 communities in Shanghai to investigate the rela­
tionship between multi-scalar spatial dimensions and the socio-economic (dis)advantage of populations con­
cerning healthcare resource accessibility. Distinct from previous studies, this research quantifies social inequality 
by considering the demographics of community residents and their interactions with healthcare facilities. We 
elucidate the stratified spatial distribution of healthcare accessibility across various spatial scales in Shanghai, 
leveraging Web Application Programming Interface (API) technology and examine the pervasive social in­
equalities across sub-district, district, and the central urban-suburban divide, focusing on specific population 
subgroups including gender, age, education level, wealth, household registration, ethnicity, occupation, and 
housing living facilities. Findings reveal that disparities in healthcare accessibility correlate with the quality of 
healthcare facilities, the socio-spatial attributes of localities, and the socio-economic and demographic profiles of 
the populations. The insights from this research will aid policymakers in enhancing the distribution and pro­
vision of healthcare resources, thereby promoting spatial and social equity in public healthcare system planning 
and implementation.   
1. Introduction 
The urban system offers a diverse range of local and cross-regional 
public services (Tahmasbi et al., 2019; Taleai et al., 2014), including 
transportation, education, healthcare, green spaces, and recreation, 
thereby enhancing the quality of residents’ lives (Bettencourt, 2020; Fan 
et al., 2022). Characterized by population growth and land expansion 
(Mahtta et al., 2022; Satterthwaite et al., 2010), urbanization has, 
however, led to uneven spatial and social-demographic distribution of 
public services, giving rise to issues of social inequality (Fan et al., 2022; 
Xu et al., 2022; Yu et al., 2023). Among the various essential social 
services in residents’ daily lives, healthcare services play a crucial role, 
particularly evident in the vulnerability and inequity of the current 
healthcare system during the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic (Bi 
et al., 2022; Kaye et al., 2021). Against the backdrop of ongoing ur­
banization and the trend of population aging, China has implemented a 
strategic approach to gradually enhance the balance of medical resource 
allocation and services for the further improvement of the healthcare 
service system. Previous research on public healthcare services has 
made significant contributions to the spatial distribution of medical fa­
cilities and accessibility assessments (Cromley, 2019; Kar et al., 2022; Lu 
et al., 2019). However, a systematic analysis of the inequality, particu­
larly in the socio-economic dimension, of medical facilities remains 
lacking. Understanding the spatial and social inequalities in the distri­
bution of healthcare facilities is a crucial issue for achieving the goals of 
balanced medical resource allocation and services. Although in­
equalities persist, reducing spatial and social disparities contributes to 
the formation of a resilient integrated healthcare service system and 
promotes the health and well-being of the population (Xu et al., 2022). 
Some studies have begun to explore the unfairness in healthcare 
service facilities within urban systems (Cheng et al., 2020; Tao & Han, 
2021; Wang, 2012; Xia et al., 2022). However, these studies typically 
focus on the spatial distribution characteristics (Matsumoto et al., 2010; 
Zhang et al., 2017), accessibility (Luo & Whippo, 2012), and individual 
levels of healthcare facilities (McGrail & Humphreys, 2014). The 
research scale is often at the coarse level of administrative districts and

urban scales (Cheng et al., 2020; Shi et al., 2022), failing to capture the 
fine-scale spatial and social inequality features. Urban residents exhibit 
varying preferences for healthcare resources at different levels based on 
distance and service quality (Yan et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2016). As Xing 
et al. (2024) demonstrate in their study on urban health resources, 
diverse types of health facilities can enhance overall accessibility and 
equity, particularly in high-density urban areas. However, current 
research tends to quantify spatial differences in healthcare facilities, 
overlooking the significant impact of the hierarchical nature of health­
care facilities on residents’ healthcare-seeking processes. In addition, 
the essence of urban sustainable development is inherently multi-scale 
and multidimensional (Brockway et al., 2021). Concentrating on a sin­
gle spatial scale and dimension may yield different effects at different 
spatial scales (Seto et al., 2017). Although some studies have conducted 
spatial equity analyses for multiple healthcare levels across multiple 
spatial scales (Zhang et al., 2019), the revealed equity is still constrained 
within the spatial dimension. To sum up, cities face four main challenges 
described below in quantifying spatial and social inequality in accessi­
bility to healthcare facilities to inform more actionable measurements to 
improve the equity in healthcare distribution. First, lack of fine scale 
empirical data; Second, lack of comparative analysis of inequality in 
accessibility to different levels of healthcare facilities; Third, lack of 
comparative analysis of inequality in accessibility at multiple spatial 
scales; And finally, lack of analysis of disparities in accessibility by 
population subgroups characterized by demographical and socioeco­
nomic status. 
This research endeavors to bridge the existing gaps in scholarly work 
by delineating the spatial distribution and hierarchical structure of 
healthcare accessibility at various administrative tiers in Shanghai, 
utilizing Web API. It seeks to explore the attendant social disparities 
across diverse spatial units and population segments. The study lever­
ages data from three tiers of public healthcare facilities in Shanghai from 
the year 2022, encompassing geographical coordinates, facility tier, and 
resource provision metrics. Additionally, it incorporates 2020 census 
data, enriched with socio-demographic details, at the granular level of 
6164 community units. The examination of such detailed data is ex­
pected to yield actionable insights to promote social equity within sus­
tainable urban healthcare frameworks. Employing big data and real- 
time routing APIs, this research calculates travel times from each com­
munity centroid to healthcare facilities, integrating this information into 
the H2SFCA (Hierarchical two-step floating catchment area) model to 
construct an accessibility index. 
This study aims to address three main research questions: 1) What 
are the spatial distribution characteristics of accessibility to all levels 
and overall hierarchical healthcare in Shanghai? 2) What are the char­
acteristics of inequality of healthcare accessibility at multiple spatial 
scales, and 3) How does healthcare accessibility associate with social 
inequalities between groups with different socioeconomic and de­
mographic characteristics? 
2. Background 
2.1. Why healthcare accessibility matters 
Human health is a critical topic of widespread concern among global 
policymakers and interdisciplinary researchers. Healthcare, regarded as 
an inherent right irrespective of socioeconomic status, profoundly 
shapes individuals’ health outcomes, life experiences, and overall well- 
being. As the paramount urban service, healthcare safeguards normal 
functioning, thereby influencing the scope of other opportunities (Yin 
et al., 2018). However, healthcare often faces an insufficiency in 
quantity, particularly in developing countries where it is costlier 
compared to other services (Daniels, 2001; Pan et al., 2016). In essence, 
the rarity and significance of healthcare facilities contribute to the 
formidable issue of accessibility as a matter of social justice. As the 
largest developing country globally, China confronts challenges such as 
escalating healthcare costs and uneven distribution of medical resources 
(Yip et al., 2012). 
The inequality in healthcare accessibility stands as a major threat to 
overall health levels (Tao & Cheng, 2019; Wang, 2012). Inequality is 
characterized by the extent of variation or discrepancy in the allocation 
of various urban system attributes (such as income, accessibility to social 
and physical provisioning systems, and exposure to environmental 
hazards) among different populations or social groups (Clark et al., 
2022). Since the early 21st century, major cities worldwide have wit­
nessed an exacerbation of spatial inequality and socio-spatial division 
(Myambo, 2018; Smith, 2002). This spatial inequality, serving as the 
third dimension alongside economic and social disparities within cities, 
encompasses the uneven distribution of urban opportunities, with a 
critical emphasis on healthcare accessibility (United Nations, 2020). The 
inequality issue of healthcare facilities is not only a crucial domain of 
concern for urban planners and researchers but also an urgent need for 
urban residents (Cao et al., 2021). Those most adversely affected by 
these disparities are often individuals in urgent need of healthcare ser­
vices, particularly the elderly who are heavily reliant on neighborhood 
resources (Logan et al., 2019). This view is further substantiated by the 
insights from Zhang et al. (2023), which underscores the critical impact 
of urban neighborhood environments on older adults’ cognitive health, 
thereby emphasizing the urgent need for accessible healthcare in prox­
imal neighborhoods. Accessibility inequality measures the degree of 
difference in the distribution of accessibility to various opportunities or 
resources across social groups. Inequality manifests not only across 
various spatial scales, from communities to regions (Nesbitt et al., 
2019), but also across diverse socio-economic and demographic char­
acteristics (Therborn, 2014; Xu et al., 2022). This includes vital in­
equalities, which encompass biological differences among populations 
such as life, health, and death; resource inequalities, which pertain to 
the uneven distribution of resources including income, wealth, and 
educational opportunities; and existential inequalities, which involve 
the disparate recognition and treatment of individuals, evident in phe­
nomena like racial discrimination and disparities between native and 
nonnative populations. 
In response to the escalating phenomenon of healthcare inequality, 
the Chinese government has implemented extensive and deep-rooted 
healthcare reforms. Referral reforms, as part of the overall healthcare 
policy restructuring towards a tiered healthcare system, aim to enhance 
public access to medical services and alleviate regional disparities (Lu 
et al., 2019). Nevertheless, to effectively refine and enhance this referral 
system, it is crucial to understand the current accessibility and in­
equalities of hierarchical healthcare facilities. Such understanding can 
inform more specific reform measures to further improve healthcare 
accessibility and equity. 
2.2. Current research in accessibility research 
Accessibility serves as a pivotal metric in determining the ease with 
which individuals can attain opportunities and resources (Hansen, 1959; 
Jang et al., 2017). Distinct from mobility, whose primary aim is to 
enhance travel efficiency, accessibility focuses on facilitating the ease of 
human interaction and the fulfillment of activities (Grengs, 2010). It is a 
function of both the mobility afforded by transportation systems and the 
distribution and characteristics of destination points and demands. 
Numerous studies have quantified accessibility by enumerating the 
reachable facilities within an urban system by populations (Ferrer-Ortiz 
et al., 2022; Ulloa-Leon et al., 2023). However, a common limitation is 
the overlooking of facility capacities, which can vary significantly, thus 
rendering comparisons somewhat inconsistent. Additionally, many of 
these studies have relied on data from relatively coarse spatial units such 
as districts, sub-districts, or census blocks, which may not capture more 
nuanced insights into disparities (Mao & Nekorchuk, 2013; Shi et al., 
2022). To address these issues, this study incorporates capacity con­
siderations through the use of the Hierarchical 2-Step Floating 
R. Su et al.

Catchment Area (H2SFCA) method (Tao et al., 2020), an enhancement 
of the original 2SFCA approach, designed to account for the hierarchical 
nature of facilities, their capacity in terms of patient beds, and the 
population density of each community. 
Travel cost, an integral parameter in the 2SFCA formula, provides a 
nuanced understanding of ``access’’ beyond mere Euclidean distance 
(Nori-Sarma et al., 2023). Typically, travel cost (time or distance) is 
calculated using Network Analysis in Geographic Information System 
(GIS) software (Chen & Yeh, 2019; Ferrer-Ortiz et al., 2022; Kar et al., 
2022). However, this method often relies on static variables, like speed, 
and does not account for dynamic changes in transportation costs due to 
variables such as traffic congestion and waiting times. Moreover, the 
input road network data can be outdated, inaccurate, and costly to 
obtain (Wang & Xu, 2011). Recent studies have demonstrated the ad­
vantages of leveraging big data and APIs for more accurate and realistic 
route planning (Zheng et al., 2019). The use of these APIs not only 
mirrors the everyday travel patterns of residents but also provides future 
urban smart management with tools that are data-driven, labor-saving, 
real-time, and cost-effective (Mathers & Huang, 2014). In line with these 
advancements, this study employs Web mapping route planning APIs for 
calculating travel times, both on foot and by transit, from community 
centroids to healthcare facilities. This approach enables a more precise 
assessment of each resident unit’s access to healthcare services. 
2.3. Scale matters 
Urban inequality, frequently studied across regions and cities, 
manifests distinctly within the localized context of cities, particularly at 
the neighborhood level, where variations in income and ethnicity 
become evident (Clark et al., 2022; Sampson et al., 2002). This study 
investigates inequality at the community level, the most granular 
administrative scale in Shanghai. To effectively analyze populations 
within adjacent areas, it is critical to delineate the concept of ``com­
munity’’—understood here as a continuous area inhabited by a popu­
lation that maintains a web of interrelationships. These established 
social networks within communities are instrumental in maintaining 
and potentially amplifying inequalities by influencing access to oppor­
tunities (DiMaggio & Garip, 2012; Granovetter, 2018). Individuals’ 
residential choices are often constrained by their socioeconomic status 
(SES) (Molinsky & Forsyth, 2023), leading to communities of proximate 
residents who share both tangible and intangible support resources, thus 
forming a basis of social capital. However, this proximity also contrib­
utes to the deepening of inequalities due to barriers such as housing 
costs, educational attainment, income disparities, and ethnic discrimi­
nation, fostering spatial segregation (Massey & Denton, 1988; Van Eijk, 
2010). This segregation, in turn, results in social isolation and differ­
ential access to vital resources, impacting the well-being and existence 
of individuals, particularly in underprivileged conditions. 
In examining communities, social science researchers categorize 
them based on various criteria, including demographic features, his­
torical evolution, and geographic location, acknowledging the hetero­
geneity among communities. For example, the Gubei Community, 
known for its concentration of immigrants due to historical factors, 
exemplifies the diversity found within urban communities. Recognizing 
communities as fundamental units in urban governance and policy 
implementation, we consider the community as a collective entity, 
where minor travel cost differences to infrastructures or services are 
negligible within the community boundaries. Furthermore, we 
acknowledge the significance of co-location for social network forma­
tion (Lengyel et al., 2015), where large distances between neighbor­
hoods can lead to decreased social interactions and more fragmented 
social networks (Bailey et al., 2018), thereby exacerbating social 
inequality (Lengyel et al., 2015; T´
oth et al., 2021). By understanding the 
geographic and non-geographic heterogeneities between communities, 
such as variations in social capital, we aim to shed light on the nuanced 
ways in which access to opportunities, such as healthcare facilities, is 
affected within urban settings. 
3. Materials and methods 
3.1. Study area 
The city of Shanghai perches on the middle-east coastland of China, 
with an area of 6340.5 km2. According to urban development stage, 
population density, economic development degree and other factors, the 
municipality is divided into central urban area and suburban area. The 
central urban area that developed earlier includes seven districts (i.e., 
Huangpu, Xuhui, Changing, Jing ’an, Putuo, Hongkou, and Yangpu), 
covering only 4.6 percent total area of Shanghai. And suburban area 
covers about 95.4 percent area of Shanghai, including nine districts (i.e., 
Pudong, Minhang, Baoshan, Jiading, Jinshan, Fengxian, Songjiang, 
Qingpu, and Chongming). Shanghai’s permanent population reached 
24.87 million in 2020, increasing 8 percent compared to the last decade 
(Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Statistics, 2021). Like other metropol­
itan in China, Shanghai is characterized by the high population density 
with about 3500 people/km2, compact urban morphology and high 
proportion of non-native population. 
3.2. Methodological approach 
3.2.1. Data resources and processing 
Census data. The population data which represent the demand of 
healthcare resources, is at three administrative levels: district, sub- 
district (i.e., township, xiang and street) and community (i.e., village 
and community) scales. There are 6164 communities under the juris­
diction of 225 sub-districts of 16 districts in Shanghai, with each 
community averaging a population of 4030 and an area of 1.03 km2. 
Using community-scale data, this study precisely analyzes spatial 
accessibility to hierarchical healthcare, offering a nuanced under­
standing of healthcare accessibility within Shanghai’s dense urban 
fabric. The data mainly comes from the 7th National Census (Shanghai 
Statistical Bureau, n.d.), including information of residents’ demo­
graphical and SES characteristics, like population, age, gender, 
ethnicity, marital status, education degree, occupation, housing condi­
tions, vehicle ownership, household registration (hukou) status and so 
forth. These data were processed using ArcMap10.7 to link the com­
munity data to the sub-district polygon for spatial analysis. To better 
calculation of the travel time costs, population centroids are designated 
as the location of the Community Residential Committees (CRCs), which 
is usually located in the center of community to ensure high proximity to 
every housing location. The addresses of CRCs were obtained from Na­
tional Government Service Platform (General Office of the State Council, 
n.d.), which then were entered into Python codes of data processing to 
obtain their geographical coordinates through Amap Geocoding API 
(https://restapi.amap.com/v3/geocode/geo?parameters). Then, the 
obtained coordinates was transferred into WGS84 Geographic Coordi­
nate System to display spatial structure of the population units on 
geographical map using ArcMap10.7 software. 
Public healthcare services. Public healthcare services are systemati­
cally categorized and assessed by administrators into three primary 
levels, reflecting variations in scale, technical proficiency, equipment 
sophistication, and the quality of administration and healthcare delivery 
(see Supplementary Material). 
Each of these levels is further stratified into three sublevels to denote 
quality and capacity: A (the highest), B, and C (the lowest). The Hier­
archical Healthcare System (HHS) is aimed to encourage patients with 
common and frequently-occurring diseases to seek treatment at primary 
healthcare first, and for diseases beyond its functional positioning and 
service capacity, primary healthcare provides referral services for pa­
tients (General Office of the State Council, 2015). By the end of 2022, 
there were 248 community healthcare centers, 121 secondary hospitals 
and 57 tertiary hospitals. The locations, number of patient beds and

identified levels are obtained from the website of Shanghai Municipal 
Administrator of Traditional Chinese Medicine (Shanghai Municipal 
Health Commission, n.d.). The coordinates of healthcare facilities were 
collected by using Geocoding API based on their addresses. The supply 
were entered as vector points with these attributes. 
3.2.2. Methods for spatial distribution of population and healthcare 
First, we examine the distribution of population and healthcare re­
sources. This study applies mapping and Complementary Cumulative 
Density Function (CCDF) to analyze spatial distribution of population 
and healthcare facilities. Mapping visually displays the geographical 
distribution of hierarchical medical facilities and identifies specific areas 
either over-exposed to or lacking of resource distribution. CCDF can 
measure the overall distribution and significance analysis of population 
and facilities represented by the slope of graphs. 
3.2.3. Methods for accessibility to healthcare resources 
Mapping healthcare facilities locations can identify healthcare 
swamps, but these are of little interest if no one or no demand actually 
exists in these places. Therefore, this study employed the H2SFCA, 
which involves the spatial distribution of supply and demand, to mea­
sure the communities’ accessibility to hierarchical healthcare resources. 
This enhanced method is tailored to hierarchical systems and reflects 
several important features of hierarchical facilities (Tao et al., 2020). 
The mathematical calculation of accessibility to healthcare resources is

the specific healthcare facility j at the level of l; dij is the travel time from

community k; f
(

is the distance decay function (see Supplementary 
Material for details on travel time estimation, transport modes, the 
determination of the travel time threshold and supply of healthcare

3.2.4. Measure social inequality of accessibility to healthcare 
This study applies the Lorenz curve and Gini coefficient, to quantify 
the social inequality in healthcare accessibility. Lorenz curve is 
commonly used to examine the distribution of a nonnegative variable in 
any form of inequality and widely in the realm of mainly economics 
(Scheffer et al., 2017) and other disciplines, like geography (Cromley, 
2019; Jang et al., 2017). The ordering of the individual observations is 
important. The Lorenz curve is constructed by plotting the cumulative 
percentage of variable Y against the cumulative percentage of the var­
iable X from the smallest to the largest Y/X ratio. In this study, the 
horizontal axis is the cumulative share of socioeconomic variables of 
communities, and the vertical axis is the cumulative share of community 
accessibility to hierarchical healthcare. When the cumulative increase in 
Y completely match the cumulative increase in X, represented by a 
45-degree line in the graph, it means Y is a uniformly distributed vari­
able and its distribution among X is perfectly equal. The Gini coefficient 
is a numeric measure of distribution, and calculated by the ratio of area 
between the perfect equality line and Lorenz curve over the whole area 
under the perfect equality line. The coefficient ranges from 0 (perfect 
equality) and 1 (perfect inequality). The Gini coefficient is calculated 
through the following Eq. (3): 
G = 1 −
∑
n
i=1
(Xi −Xi−1)(Yi + Yi−1)
(3)  
where G is the Gini coefficient, i represents the number of communities, 
which is sorted and numbered based on Y/X ratio, X is cumulative share 
of population at the community scale, X0 = 0. And Y is cumulative share 
of the accessibility to healthcare, Y0= 0. 
The Gini coefficient is interpreted across five distinct levels: a coef­
ficient below 0.2 denotes very low inequality, suggesting near absolute 
equality. A coefficient ranging between 0.2 and 0.29 is indicative of low 
inequality, representing a state of comparative equality. Values from 0.3 
to 0.39 signify moderate inequality, reflecting relative equality within 
the societal structure. A coefficient between 0.4 and 0.49 denotes high 
inequality, a clear indication of significant income disparities. Finally, a 
coefficient of 0.5 or higher reflects extremely high levels of inequality, 
indicative of severe disparity within the distribution of income or re­
sources. It is generally understood that a Gini coefficient of 0.4 acts as a 
threshold or ``warning line,’’ signaling a critical point beyond which 
inequality is considered problematic and potentially destabilizing for 
the societal fabric. 
3.2.4.1. Multiscale inequality of accessibility to healthcare. We described 
inequality characteristics across three spatial scales based on calculated 
accessibility indexes and population at the community scale. First, we 
measured Gini coefficient for each sub-districts to explore the spatial 
pattern. Second, we analyzed the differences between the central urban 
area and the suburban areas based on the Gini coefficient calculated at 
the sub-district scale. Third, we analyzed inequality between 16 districts 
characterized by various urbanization characteristics by drawing Lorenz 
curve and calculating the Gini coefficients of healthcare accessibility 
based on their cumulative size and population at the community scale. 
Furthermore, we conducted a correlation analysis to better understand 
the urbanization factors that may explain the accessibility inequalities at 
the district scale. We selected from SEIU data framework of social- 
ecological-infrastructural systems (Clark et al., 2022) including ten 
variables to represent urbanized attributes of the districts: social actors 
and social provisioning systems (S): Basic demographic (population, 
household and gender related variables), basic economic (wealth related 
variables); Ecological and natural systems (E): percentage of green 
coverage; and Urban form and design (U): area of district, percentage of 
buildings and traffic routes. Among them, data of building, traffic routes 
and green coverage were derived from the SinoLC-1 land-cover product 
(Li et al., 2023). Other types of attribute data were derived from the 
Shanghai Statistical Yearbook in 2020 (Shanghai Statistical Bureau, 
2021). 
3.2.4.2. Inequality between wealthy and poor communities. Due to the 
lack of household income data variables, we use the average family car 
price of the community to measure the wealth level of the community. 
Like primary residence and other real estate, car is a form of wealth 
(Brul´
e & Ravazzini, 2019). Therefore, car price is an indicator to reflect 
the wealth levels of different residential communities to a certain extent. 
This household car prices at each community were derived from seventh 
census data. 
3.2.4.3. Differential accessibility among population groups. To compare 
the accessibility to healthcare among subgroups with different socio­
economic and demographic characteristics, the study calculated the 
weighted average accessibility of subgroups by the formula shown in Eq. 
(4):

4. Results 
4.1. Spatial distribution of population and healthcare facilities in 
Shanghai 
From the perspective of spatial distribution, both communities and 
healthcare facilities in Shanghai are highly concentrated in the central 
urban area and small core areas in the outer suburbs (Fig. 1a and b). 
Shanghai as a whole has formed a large core area, with the central urban 
area accounting for less than 5 % of the city’s area, but accounting for 27 
% of the city’s population. The population density of the central urban 
area is 23,091 people /km2, which is about 7.7 times that of the sub­
urban area (3005 people /km2). The suburbs of Songjiang, Minhang, 
Pudong and Baoshan all form small core areas of similar size, which are 
usually located in the administrative centers of these districts. Health­
care facilities are clustered in the city center, with primary, secondary 
and tertiary healthcare facilities accounting for 33 %, 43 % and 60 %, 
respectively. The distribution of healthcare facilities and residential 
areas in the suburban districts is similar, and a small core area is formed 
around the administrative center. 
Generally, in highly developed and densely populated central urban 
areas, there is a more abundant availability of healthcare resources. 
According to the data presented in Fig. 1b, public healthcare facilities at 
different levels exhibit distinct spatial distribution patterns. Primary 
healthcare facilities are the most uniformly distributed, ensuring basic 
medical coverage in nearly every sub-district. Conversely, the distribu­
tion of secondary and tertiary hospitals is relatively more concentrated 
and uneven, predominantly located in or near the central urban areas. 
Tertiary hospitals, which are fewer in number and possess the most 
specialized resources, demonstrate the most significant imbalance in 
their distribution. Approximately 60 % of these facilities are located 
within the central urban areas. Notably, Pudong and Minhang districts, 
ranking first and third in Gross Regional Production (GRP) respectively 
in 2022, each host more than five tertiary hospitals. In stark contrast, the 
remaining seven peripheral suburban districts are home to only zero to 
two tertiary hospitals each, despite collectively housing about 40 % of 
Shanghai’s total population as of 2020. Secondary hospitals, though less 
centralized than tertiary hospitals, maintain a more widespread 
geographic presence across all districts. However, their distribution is 
still less even when compared to primary healthcare facilities. Further­
more, the study observes that, apart from primary healthcare centers 
which maintain a relatively consistent distribution, both secondary and 
tertiary hospitals tend to be situated in areas with higher population 
densities, reflecting a pattern of healthcare resource allocation that 
aligns with population distribution. This information underscores the 
challenge of balancing healthcare resource distribution with de­
mographic and developmental factors across different urban and sub­
urban areas. 
To further examine the generality of these findings, we plotted the 
CCDFs of the density of population and hierarchical healthcare facilities 
in each sub-district unit, as well calculated the slopes of these four sizes 
distribution (Fig. 1c and d). We fitted a linear formula to examine the 
slopes of the CCDFs of population and facilities density at the sub-district 
scale. As we can observe from Fig. 1c, d, the slopes of CCDFs for 
healthcare facilities are sharper than the CCDF for population. Hence, 
we consider that the distribution of population is more polycentric than 
facility distribution in shanghai. A conclusion can be drawn that of the 
three tiers of healthcare infrastructure, tertiary healthcare facilities 
demonstrate a more monocentric distribution pattern, whereas primary 
healthcare facilities exhibit a notably polycentric distribution. The CCDF 
findings corroborate the spatial analysis, indicating a higher concen­
tration of healthcare facilities relative to the distribution of the popu­
lation. This disparity between the population distribution and the 
geographic distribution of healthcare facilities poses significant chal­
lenges in achieving equitable access to these services. 
4.2. Spatial pattern of accessibility to hierarchical healthcare 
The accessibility to different levels of healthcare at the community 
scale demonstrates varying spatial distribution characteristics, as illus­
trated in Fig. 2. Although there are fewer healthcare facilities at higher 
levels, the average accessibility score is higher from primary to tertiary 
healthcare. This gradient change can be attributed to the fact that, under 
constant demand conditions, the supply of healthcare resources 
measured by product of healthcare level and number of patient beds are 
larger for higher-tier healthcare, regardless of longer distance needed to 
travel from communities to the facilities. This result aligns with the 
previously stated principle that higher-tier hospitals tend to possess 
more resources, including beds, physicians, and advanced treatment 
technologies, and thus have more capacity to accommodate healthcare 
needs. Furthermore, the spatial distribution of accessibility relative 
value shows a gradient change from small polycentric catchment to 
large monocentric catchment from lower-tier healthcare to higher-tier 
healthcare.

Accessibility to primary healthcare presents a spatial distribution in a 
multicenter checkerboard format (Fig. 2a). Accessibility of the central 
urban area is at the moderate level in general. In the suburbs, high 
accessibility areas occur around primary healthcare facilities, while 
other areas far from facilities have low accessibility. This is mainly due 
to the abundance of primary healthcare resources in compact urban 
centers, but the high-density demographic characteristics (higher de­
mand) offset the advantage of distance. While areas closer to primary 
healthcare resources in less densely populated suburbs have better ac­
cess to medical resources, distance plays a bigger role in this case. It is 
worth noting that the accessibility of primary healthcare resources in 
Chongming District is at a high level among districts, especially in the 
northwestern region. This is mainly due to the fact that Chongming 
District has the lowest population density in Shanghai (only 538 people 
/km2, while the average population density of Shanghai is 3923 people 
/km2), but the distribution of primary healthcare facilities configured by 
sub-district is relatively even. 
In terms of spatial distribution, the accessibility to secondary hos­
pitals present a polycentric pattern (Fig. 2b). Multiple high-value centers 
are located at the central urban area and peripheral suburban areas, 
such as the northern, southwestern, northwestern, and southeastern 
areas. For example, areas like Chengqiao Town in Chongming District to 
the north in and Zhujing Town in Jinshan District to the southwest are 
each home to three and two secondary hospitals, respectively. As a 
result, accessibility to secondary healthcare in these areas is higher than 
their surrounding areas. Despite having a higher density of secondary 
hospitals, the accessibility of the central urban area is not significantly 
higher than that of the above mentioned suburban areas. This is because 
the competition for healthcare resources is much higher due to 
exceptionally high population density in the central urban area. It is 
notable that some accessibility swamps exist in areas with a large pop­
ulation, including the intersections of multiple districts and the islands 
of Hengsha and Changxing in Chongming District. 
Compared to lower-tier healthcare, tertiary hospitals exhibit a 
significantly different accessibility distribution pattern (Fig. 2c). It is 
clear that accessibility index with a monocentric pattern gradually de­
creases from the core areas of the central urban area outwards to pe­
ripheral area. Most tertiary hospitals cluster in small areas within the 
central urban zone, with only a few hospitals scattered throughout the 
extensive suburban regions. Despite the higher population density in the 
central urban area, indicating greater demand, greater proximity to 
tertiary hospitals gives residents living here advantages in accessing to 
healthcare resources. 
The general spatial accessibility is a comprehensive measurement of 
the spatial accessibility to healthcare across all three levels. As shown in 
Fig. 2d, the spatial accessibility to hierarchical healthcare in Shanghai is 
unevenly distributed. The highest general accessibility is located on the 
northwestern region of Chongming District which can be attributed to 
the high-level accessibility to primary healthcare. In addition, the much 
higher general accessibility is concentrated in the seven districts within 
and the area of Pudong District near the central urban area. The core 
zone of Shanghai has the highest population density and the most 
concentrated healthcare facilities, especially secondary and tertiary 
hospitals. From the core area, the general accessibility gradually de­
creases and reaches the minimum in the periphery of Shanghai. Given 
that the spatial accessibility index takes both demand and supply into 
account, the uneven distribution of accessibility reveals significant 
mismatch between the supply and demand of healthcare resources. In

this case, the spatial distribution of healthcare resources is even more 
concentrated than that of population. 
4.3. Multiscale inequality in accessibility to healthcare 
4.3.1. Inequality among sub-districts 
As shown in Fig. 3, the distribution patterns of Gini coefficient of 
accessibility to healthcare vary among sub-districts and healthcare’s 
level. From primary to tertiary healthcare, the number of sub-districts 
with a Gini coefficient above the 0.4 warning line is decreasing, indi­
cating that inequality within sub-district units decreases as the level of 
healthcare facilities increases. This result suggests that the accessibility 
to a larger number of evenly distributed healthcare facilities is more 
likely to produce unequal outcomes on smaller spatial units, while the 
accessibility to rarer and more concentrated healthcare facilities varies 
less within smaller spatial units because the factor of travel costs within 
the unit dominates the accessibility outcomes. Regardless of the levels of 
healthcare facilities, the Gini coefficient of the sub-district units within 
and surrounding the central urban area is basically less than the warning 
line 0.4. 
For the Gini coefficient of spatial accessibility to primary healthcare 
(Fig. 3a), the inequality index in most sub-districts has exceeded 0.5, 
which belongs to very inequality category, except for the area with high 
accessibility in Chongming District. For secondary healthcare (Fig. 3b), 
areas with higher levels of inequality are concentrated in the sub-distrcts 
in the Chongming District, southwestern and eastern coastal regions of 
Shanghai, and the accessibility to secondary healthcare is usually lower 
in these regions. For tertiary healthcare (Fig. 3c), Chongming and the 
western and eastern marginal regions of Shanghai exhibit higher 
inequality (Gini > 0.4) compared to other areas. Additionally, we 
observed that sub-districts with higher inequality tend to be situated at 
the boundaries of districts and the areas far from the central area. In 
sum, we identified two primary patterns: sub-districts distanced from 
urban centers exhibit greater inequality, and those with reduced access 
to hierarchical healthcare facilities also demonstrate increased 
inequality. 
Regarding the spatial distribution pattern of general accessibility 
inequality as depicted in Fig. 3d, it is observed to bear resemblance to 
that of tertiary hospitals shown in Fig. 3c. However, there is a notable 
distinction in that the inequality among sub-district units is compara­
tively lower, with an average Gini coefficient of 0.28, and a significantly 
reduced inequality at the sub-district scale within the Chongming dis­
trict. These findings suggest that, when compared across various 
healthcare facility levels, access to general healthcare resources in 
Shanghai manifests a relatively equitable distribution at the sub-district 
scale. Nonetheless, it remains crucial to monitor areas where the Gini 
coefficient indicates a high level of inequality, particularly as several 
sub-districts, predominantly those on the city’s periphery, exhibit co­
efficients surpassing the critical threshold of 0.4. 
4.3.2. Inequality across urban-suburban spectrum 
The result indicates that suburban areas exhibit higher inequality 
(higher Gini coefficient) in healthcare accessibility compared to the 
central urban area (lower Gini coefficient) across hierarchical

healthcare (Fig. 4). Evidently, there remains a gap in the spatial equality 
of accessibility to hierarchical healthcare between central urban and 
suburban areas. Inequalities in accessibility to primary healthcare 
(paired Student’s t = −12.91, d.f. = 213.23, p < 0.001), secondary 
healthcare (paired Student’s t = −10.26, d.f. = 220.79, p < 0.001), 
tertiary healthcare (paired Student’s t = −8.35, d.f. = 205.15, p <
0.001), and general (paired Student’s t = −7.39, d.f. = 219.01, p <
0.001) are significantly higher in suburban areas than in the central 
urban area. The median Gini coefficients of accessibility indexes of 
primary, secondary, tertiary and general healthcare in the central urban 
areas are comparative equality (Gini = 0.24, 0.24, 0.22 and 0.21 
respectively). In contrast, for the suburban areas, the accessibility in­
dexes are at the inequality level for primary and secondary healthcare 
(Gini = 0.48 and 0.4, respectively) and relative equality for tertiary and

general healthcare (Gini = 0.32 and 0.30, respectively). Furthermore, 
we observed that the Gini coefficients decreased with the increase of 
healthcare level in both urban and suburban areas and the inequality is 
lower in general accessibility to healthcare. 
4.3.3. Inequality among districts 
To understand the overall inequality of hierarchical healthcare 
accessibility at the spatial units (i.e., districts) that constitute central 
urban and suburban areas, we analyzed the inequality characteristics 
among districts. Equality of hierarchical healthcare was nearly consis­
tent with the results of comparison between central urban and suburban 
areas. As shown in Fig. 5, there are variations in the levels of inequality 
of accessibility to healthcare among districts in Shanghai. The seven 
districts in the central urban area exhibit relatively lower spatial 
inequality compared to the nine districts in the suburbs. For tertiary 
healthcare (Fig. 5c), the Gini coefficients for the seven administrative 
districts in the central urban area range from 0.24 to 0.29, indicating a 
comparative equality distribution of accessibility. In contrast, the nine 
administrative districts in the suburbs all but Chongming (with a high 
Gini coefficient of 0.9) range from relative equality to inequality (Gini 
coefficients between 0.36 and 0.46). Similar with tertiary healthcare 
accessibility, the inequality characteristics in secondary healthcare ac­
cess are comparable (Fig. 5b), with a slightly higher level of equality in 
the central urban area (Gini coefficients between 0.31 and 0.38) 
compared to the suburbs (Gini coefficients between 0.43 and 0.65). The 
inequality characteristics of primary healthcare are similar with that of 
higher-tier ones (Fig. 5a), but the Gini coefficient spans larger from the 
seven districts in the central urban area to the nine districts in the 
suburban area (increases from 0.26 to 0.33 of comparative and relative 
equality to more than 0.5 of very inequality) (Fig. 5d). 
We further conducted a correlation analysis to elucidate the de­
terminants contributing to accessibility disparities at the district level. 
As shown in Fig. 6, the three Gini coefficients representing accessibility 
to hierarchical healthcare exhibit uniform directional correlations with 
various demographic and geographic variables. Each coefficient is 
inversely correlated with factors such as population density, the pro­
portion of land utilized for buildings, and the prevalence of traffic 
routes. Conversely, there is a significant positive correlation with the 
district’s total area, the sex ratio of the population, and the percentage of 
green spaces. It is also noteworthy that there exists a negative, albeit 
weak, correlation between the Gini coefficients and economic indicators 
such as GDP. Summarily, the findings indicate that areas with more 
advanced urbanization tend to experience lower levels of inequality in 
healthcare accessibility. 
4.4. Differential accessibility to healthcare among socioeconomic groups 
As shown in Fig. 7, the Gini coefficient reflects disparities among 
communities in healthcare accessibility. Results demonstrated that there 
are very inequalities in accessibility to primary, secondary and tertiary 
healthcare resources (Gini coefficient > 0.5) between relatively 
impoverished and relatively affluent communities (Fig. 7a). From 
Fig. 7b, our findings suggest that wealthier communities have greater 
accessibility to high-quality tertiary healthcare resources than poorer 
communities, while they have lesser accessibility to primary healthcare 
resources. There is no significant difference of accessibility to secondary 
healthcare between wealthy and poor communities, although the most 
affluent communities still outperform others in accessibility index. 
These observations might be explained the fact that wealthy residents 
tend to live in the central urban area where the cost of living is higher 
and the tertiary healthcare are greater and more concentrated. Poorer 
communities, on the other hand, often live in suburban areas where 
population density is lower and primary healthcare resources are better 
available. Furthermore, the disparity in wealth, as indicated in Table 1

with household car prices ranging from a minimum of zero to a 
maximum of nearly 760,000, exacerbates social inequalities in health 
accessibility. This economic divide, reflected in the wide spectrum of 
vehicle values, further deepens the gap in healthcare accessibility be­
tween affluent and less affluent communities. 
As shown in Fig. 8, the results reveal disparities of average accessi­
bility to hierarchical healthcare among different socioeconomic and 
demographic groups. In general, vulnerable populations (residents not 
registered in Shanghai, individuals with lower levels of education, those 
in lower-paying occupations, and households with substandard housing 
living facilities) usually have lower accessibility to public healthcare 
facilities compared to advantaged groups. Specifically, Fig. 8a demon­
strates that the accessibility index for females (mean ratio: 0.478; 
Table 1) is slightly higher than that for males, suggesting a relative 
gender parity or slight advantage in healthcare access for females, 
contrary to the common knowledge that women are typically considered 
a disadvantaged sex group in research and real-life contexts. Similarly, 
as depicted in Fig. 8d, the elderly aged 60 or above, who constitute 
0.253 of community population on average, as well as children and 
adolescents (aged 19 or below) experience slightly higher accessibility 
than other age groups. However, as shown in Fig. 8b, residents holding 
local household registrations have better access to healthcare resources

compared to the non-local registered population, which comprises, on 
average, about 40.8 % of the community population and often consists 
of migrants from less developed regions. Fig. 8c indicates that ethnic 
background can also affect accessibility, with minority groups having 
slightly lower accessibility to healthcare resources compared to the Han 
population, even though they comprise only average 1.6 % of popula­
tion in neighborhoods. Fig. 8e demonstrates healthcare accessibility 
stratified by education attainment levels: subgroups with higher levels 
of education (mean ratio: 0.312) have greater accessibility to secondary 
and tertiary healthcare, but lower accessibility to primary healthcare. 
We can observe from Fig. 8f, that the subgroups of managers (govern­
ment, social organizations, and corporate executives) and specialists (e. 
g., professionals in scientific research, engineering, economics, and 
finance) have higher healthcare accessibility than other occupational 
categories. Finally, disparities in healthcare accessibility are also man­
ifested in the housing living conditions (Fig. 8g): households without 
piped water supply (mean ratio: 0.012), without a separate kitchen 
(mean ratio: 0.048), and lacking water heaters for bathing (mean ratio: 
0.093) facilities have lower accessibility to healthcare resources. 
5. Discussion 
The findings of our study have broad implications for understanding 
the inequality in healthcare accessibility and offering insights into city 
policy making progressing towards sustainable development. 
Firstly, this study emphasizes the significance of the complex in­
teractions among population, healthcare, and transportation networks 
within urban systems. The interplay of them can influence outcomes 
such as demand satisfaction and resource utilization efficiency, thereby 
giving rise to societal inequality issues. The spatial misalignment be­
tween healthcare facilities and population has historical roots and stems 
from social development. The concentration of tertiary hospitals in 
central urban areas is largely attributed to the establishment of public 
concessions during the era of commercial ports (Yan, 2013). The central 
urban area, including parts of Minhang and Pudong, have been under 
the jurisdiction of Shanghai since its establishment in the 1930s, rep­
resenting the earliest developed regions. In contrast, suburban areas 
experienced delayed development, with nine suburbs incorporated into 
Shanghai after 1958 and subsequently upgraded to district status in the 
1990s to expedite regional economic development. During the subse­
quent rapid urbanization process, the healthcare system in the suburbs 
gradually developed with the influx of migrant populations and 
improved economic conditions (Ouyang et al., 2017). Under Hierar­
chical Healthcare System, the allocation of healthcare resources exhibits 
an inverted pyramid structure, where the accessibility is lowest for 
primary healthcare facilities with the highest demand, while secondary 
and tertiary healthcare institutions, with relatively fewer in number, 
demonstrate higher accessibility, distorting the HHS. The primary goal 
of the establishment of HHS is to systematically enhance the spatial 
distribution of healthcare at various levels, aligning it with diverse 
resident demands (Tang et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2019). The main 
findings of our study suggests that the healthcare resources exhibit an 
imbalance in both hierarchical structure and spatial distribution. For 
further policy formulation, our research recommends configuring 
healthcare resources based on the pyramidal pattern of disease inci­
dence and the corresponding residents’ 
healthcare demands.

Specifically, for prevalent and common diseases that affect a majority of 
the population, primary healthcare facilities addressing diagnostic, 
screening, and treatment functions should receive sufficient financial 
investment, staffing, bed capacities, and medical equipment to enhance 
their accessibility. On the other hand, for rare and complex medical 
conditions as well as emergencies, advanced medical facilities equipped 
with sophisticated medical equipment and specialized personnel should 
have a broader coverage in geographic space, ensuring economies of 
scale in the provision of healthcare services. 
Secondly, multiscale spatial analysis indicates variations in the size 
and distribution of inequality across different levels of healthcare fa­
cilities. In configuring primary healthcare facilities, addressing 
inequality in sub-district units requires consideration not only of quan­
tity of facilities (Shanghai Health Commission, 2020), but also of their 
spatial locations to meet the needs of diverse communities across the 
sub-districts. A holistic perspective that oversees the locations and the 
number of patient beds of primary healthcare facilities, transcending 
administrative boundaries, can alleviate the high inequality in accessi­
bility. The configuration of secondary healthcare needs to balance issues 
of healthcare resource accessibility and fairness. Particularly, 
sub-districts located in the outer peripheries in suburban districts such 
as Qingpu, Jinshan, Pudong, and Chongming are in a disadvantaged 
position regarding both accessibility and equality. Feasible measures 
include the addition of secondary hospitals, increasing the supply of 
healthcare resources, or enhancing the transportation convenience of 
Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) models to improve the physical 
mobility of populations (Frank et al., 2022). The primary issue with 
tertiary healthcare resources is their excessive concentration. Therefore, 
a judicious redistribution of resources from resource-rich areas (central 
urban areas) to resource-poor areas (suburbs), including the addition of 
tertiary hospitals, establishment of branches, and expansion and 
upgrading of secondary hospitals in suburban areas, is necessary. 
Overall accessibility is more equal across multiple spatial scales 
compared to any individual hierarchical accessibility, indicating that 
China’s HHS effectively mitigates spatial inequalities in healthcare re­
sources. This aligns with research conclusions focused on the Shenzhen 
region (Tao & Han, 2021). The observed inequality in healthcare 
accessibility is inversely correlated with the urbanization level of dis­
tricts, reflecting central urban areas-suburbs duality imbalance. Subur­
ban areas, especially those on the periphery, face dual challenges of 
inadequate and unequal healthcare resources, posing sustainability 
challenges for their development. In conclusion, the inevitability and 
omnipresence of inequality in healthcare resource accessibility neces­
sitate a deeper understanding at different scales to promote nuanced 
urban governance. 
Thirdly, our study demonstrates that vulnerable populations are at a 
disadvantage in the healthcare accessibility. Socioeconomic and de­
mographic disparities in the process and delivery of the healthcare 
contribute to these disparities in health outcomes (Andrulis, 1998; Fis­
cella et al., 2000). Community features have been associated with 
inequality in healthcare accessibility among residents, particularly for 
those living in economically disadvantaged places. Urban residents in 
poor communities have more difficulties getting high-quality healthcare 
treatment 
when 
they 
suffer 
from 
intractable 
diseases. 
The 
socio-economic barriers, including economic constraints and lack of 
awareness, even make it worse. For nonnative residents, who constitute 
nearly half of the population – a common trend in other major cities 
–access to healthcare facilities have both spatial barriers and policy 
barriers. Without access to formal subsidized housing and other benefits, 
migrants from rural areas are forced to live in informal housing on the 
outskirts (Zhang, 2001). Faced with institutionalized discrimination 
caused by the household registration system, migrants are also excluded 
from local welfare including the provision of public healthcare services 
(Ouyang et al., 2017), further compounding the challenges they face in 
accessing essential healthcare. Residents living in poor housing condi­
tions are particularly vulnerable to health issues for lack of clean piped 
water, lack of kitchen to make nutritious food, and lack of bathing fa­
cilities to maintain hygiene (Deogaonkar, 2004). Deprived of proper 
accessibility to healthcare facilities exacerbate the already high health 
risks for the under-privileged population. Economically, lower-paying 
occupations and lower education attainment level reflecting in­
dividual’s economic ability, acting through the agents of residential 
segregation and poorer environment, relate to poorer accessibility and 
thus potential health outcomes (Zhu et al., 2017). There is no significant 
disadvantage for vulnerable groups such as women and the elderly in 
healthcare accessibility. The underlying reason may be that older people 
and women are more prevalent in central urban areas than in the sub­
urbs, where overall accessibility is lower (Tab. S1). However, there is 
still a warning that targeted measures are needed to help elderly and 
females living in the periphery of the city. While inadequate healthcare 
infrastructure can lead to accessibility issues, social marginalization can 
intensify these disparities, making the problem more acute for certain 
groups. In a word, the effects on social and economic inequality in 
healthcare are multifaceted due to geographic, social, economic and 
institution related factors. 
To align with and further the aims of the Sustainable Development 
Goals, particularly Goal 3, Goal 10, and Goal 11, we propose three 
governance recommendations. First, as urban expansion continues and 
available space in high-density central areas diminishes, it is anticipated 
that a strategic redistribution of healthcare resources toward suburban 
areas will occur. This shift aims to mitigate the discrepancies in 
healthcare accessibility between central and suburban areas and across 
social subgroups, thereby promoting a more balanced regional devel­
opment of healthcare infrastructure beyond administrative confines. 
Second, for densely populated metropolis with a dynamic population 
flux like Shanghai, enhancing inter-provincial healthcare reimburse­
ment mechanisms is crucial. Such advancements will significantly alle­
viate the burden on migrants, ensuring more equitable healthcare 
provision across diverse demographic segments. Thirdly, we suggest 
incorporating a strategic integration of healthcare facilities within 
community settings, with a particular focus on under-served suburban 
areas and disadvantaged groups. Urban planners should prioritize the 
development of neighborhoods that facilitate easy accessibility to pri­
mary healthcare services, thereby reducing disparities in healthcare 
availability. Lastly, adopting a people-centered strategy is imperative to 
cater to the varying healthcare needs of different population strata. This 
approach involves actively engaging with and incorporating public 
feedback into healthcare planning and delivery, with a focus on un­
derstanding and meeting the healthcare requirements of the most 
vulnerable groups. Emphasizing tailored healthcare solutions and in­
clusive policy-making will contribute to a more equitable and sustain­
able healthcare system. 
The current study is subject to several limitations. Firstly, the 
calculation of the healthcare accessibility index primarily centers 
around spatial dimensions. However, in practice, socio-economic, and 
technological factors such as the affordability of healthcare services, 
diverse healthcare needs, and emerging trends in internet hospitals, all 
constitute multi-dimensional elements that can significantly influence 
the healthcare accessibility. Future research endeavors should incor­
porate these diverse factors into consideration. Secondly, this study 
exclusively focuses on public hospitals, overlooking the important role 
played by private hospitals as an integral component of the healthcare 
system, offering alternative choices to meet the varied needs of resi­
dents. Thirdly, although real-time Web APIs were employed for calcu­
lating travel times, individual transportation choices, future urban 
transportation developments, and changes in land use may potentially 
impact the ultimate results. Therefore, it is essential to interpret the 
findings in light of these considerations. Fourth, this study simplified the 
calculation of accessibility by using community scales as the smallest 
analytical units for estimating travel time from community centroids to 
healthcare facilities. However, applying a backtracking algorithm that 
adjusts speed based on land use information layers could also calculate 
R. Su et al.

dynamic accessibility (Carra et al., 2022). Additionally, incorporating 
other data such as demographic registries to map the distribution and 
composition of resident populations would provide a finer scale of 
analysis (Barbara et al., 2021). This approach was constrained in the 
current study due to the lack of related information. Future research 
should consider selecting appropriate methods based on the availability 
of suitable data and methodologies to determine more significant cor­
relations between sociodemographic characteristics and accessibility to 
health services at a finer scale. Lastly, our research is centered on 
Shanghai as a case study. While Shanghai stands as a typical large city in 
China, future studies should encompass a broader range of cities to 
bolster the generalizability and applicability of knowledge pertaining to 
healthcare inequalities. 
6. Conclusion 
Through data-driven analysis, our study uncovers novel insights into 
the variances in accessibility to hierarchical healthcare resources among 
various spatial units and socio-economic as well as demographic groups, 
thereby elucidating the associated spatial and social inequalities. Our 
findings delineate that both the population and healthcare facilities 
manifest a spatial distribution pattern characterized by higher densities 
in central urban areas and lower densities in peripheral suburban re­
gions. The accessibility and distribution of healthcare services vary 
among different tiers, with lower-tier facilities offering more evenly 
distributed services but lower accessibility. Yet, the spatial allocation of 
healthcare facilities in comparison to population distribution is more 
skewed, creating a misalignment between availability and need. This 
disparity may contribute to healthcare access disparities and subsequent 
social inequality. The application of the Gini coefficient in assessing 
social inequality elucidates that at the sub-district scale, communities 
face greater disparities in accessing lower-tier healthcare resources, 
whereas access to general healthcare appears more uniformly distrib­
uted compared to tiered healthcare. Suburbs exhibit higher inequality in 
healthcare accessibility than the central urban area. At the district level, 
Gini coefficients inversely correlate with population density, building 
and transportation proportions, and GRP, while positively correlating 
with district area, gender ratio, and green space coverage. From a socio- 
economic vantage point, the research highlights pronounced variances 
in healthcare accessibility among poor and wealthy communities, 
particularly regarding tertiary hospitals. The study reveals that 
marginalized groups, such as non-local residents, ethnic minorities, in­
dividuals with lower education levels, those in lower-income occupa­
tions, and those in substandard housing conditions, disproportionately 
experience limited healthcare accessibility. This research provides 
valuable information that can assist policymakers in improving the 
allocation and delivery of healthcare resources. Such enhancements will 
contribute to achieving greater spatial and social fairness in the planning 
and execution of public healthcare systems.

Nurses use electronic medical record (EMR) systems to accomplish a variety of care-related tasks. 
Nurses, therefore, encounter a range of stressful situations and events related to using EMR 
systems, a phenomenon known as technostress. Previous research suggests that individuals 
appraise technostress differently. However, not much is known about the appraisal process of 
technostress. By integrating the literature on technostress, affordances, and appraisal theory, this 
paper introduces the appraisal theory of technostress, which is developed empirically through an 
interpretive case study involving interviews with hospital nurses. The appraisal theory of tech­
nostress explains how individuals process and appraise information about how to potentially act 
on technology-related stressful events through a system’s features. Information about the event, 
and information about the action potential afforded by the system’s features, is evaluated through 
an appraisal process that includes three appraisal checks: goal relevance, goal conduciveness, and 
value compatibility. The appraisal checks verify whether the action possibilities of the system’s 
features align or misalign with an individual’s goals and values related to action, and shape how 
the event and the system’s features are appraised as challenge or hindrance techno-stressors. 
Overall, the study offers a novel theoretical perspective and methodological approach to 
conceptualizing and investigating technostress. More detailed contributions to research and 
practice are also discussed.   
1. Introduction 
Healthcare information technology (IT) plays a central role in how nurses deliver care. For example, nurses use healthcare IT to 
archive patient data, access a patient’s medical history, evaluate a patient’s clinical status, administer medications, and coordinate 
care (Anderson & Robey, 2017; Brown, Pope, Bosco, Mason, & Morgan, 2020; Strong et al., 2014). Nurses also use healthcare IT to 
document what occurred during other patient-related events, such as bathing a patient, taking a patient for a walk, and changing a 
patient’s clothes (Somani & Khowaja, 2012). Because technology is vital to carrying out many of their care-related duties, and given 
the highly stressful nature of their job, nurses regularly encounter a variety of stressful situations surrounding the use of healthcare IT 
(Califf, Sarker, & Sarker, 2020; Furlong, 2015; Vehko et al., 2019; Yen et al., 2016). 
Consider the following story, for example, told by a nurse named Angela, who works in the surgical unit of an acute care hospital

(see Furlong, 2015 for the entire story). On the day she was scheduled to leave the hospital, Angela’s patient began experiencing severe 
shortness of breath. Angela and the care team rushed her to the intensive care unit (ICU) to receive emergency care. On the way to the 
ICU, the on-call doctor updated and approved the care instructions in her electronic medical file, which is stored in the hospital’s 
electronic medical record (EMR) system. When arriving at the ICU, the ICU nurses and doctors, unfortunately, could not access her file 
because she was still assigned to the surgical unit. This is because the EMR system is designed so that the nurses and doctors can access 
files for patients assigned to their units only. Angela made a frantic phone call to the technology help desk staff, who quickly resolved 
the issue. The ICU doctors and nurses eventually provided life-saving care. 
Angela’s experience in the above example is indicative of how introducing information systems into work practices affects 
workplace stress related to using technology, a phenomenon referred to as technology-related stress, or technostress. Information 
systems (IS) research on technostress tends to emphasize the negative experiences of technostress, such as Angela’s experiences with 
her hospital’s EMR system. For example, IS researchers tend to investigate how undesirable technology-related stressful situations and 
events impact several deleterious individual and workplace outcomes (Ayyagari, Grover, & Purvis, 2011; Galluch, Grover, & Thatcher, 
2015; Ragu-Nathan, Tarafdar, Ragu-Nathan, & Tu, 2008; Tarafdar, Tu, Ragu-Nathan, & Ragu-Nathan, 2007). However, a more recent 
study found that individuals, and specifically nurses, can experience and appraise technology-related stressful situations and events 
positively and negatively, not just negatively, and that the positive and negative appraisals play a key role in shaping the emotional and 
mental well-being of individuals as well as organizational outcomes (Califf et al., 2020). 
However, little is known about how the appraisal process of technostress occurs. For example, not much is known about the key 
mechanisms involved in the appraisal process and how the key mechanisms and the overarching contextual environment shape the 
resulting appraisal. In this paper, I draw on the holistic technostress process model (Califf et al., 2020), affordance theory (Anderson & 
Robey, 2017; Cheikh-Ammar, 2018; Fayard & Weeks, 2007, 2014), and appraisal theory (Lazarus, 1992; Scherer, 2010) to concep­
tualize and investigate the key mechanisms involved in the appraisal process of technostress. To study the key mechanisms, I use 
concepts from two research streams— affordances and appraisal theory. Affordances are used to identify how the features of tech­
nology and its associated action possibilities, as well as a user’s goals and values, shape the relationship between the user and the 
artifact and how the user decides to act on the information offered by a given situation (Cheikh-Ammar, 2018; Leonardi, 2011; Markus 
& Silver, 2008; Volkoff & Strong, 2013). Affordances in this paper are defined as several action possibilities of an EMR system used by 
nurses, which are shaped by the EMR system’s features and a nurse’s goals and values (Anderson & Robey, 2017; Cheikh-Ammar, 
2018). 
Appraisal theory argues that an individual’s goals and values play an important role in processing information related to a given 
event, evaluating how to potentially act on a given event, and categorizing and labeling information related to the event (Lazarus, 
1992; Scherer, 2010). Specifically, three appraisal checks help an individual appraise an event and evaluate how to act on the event: 
goal relevance, goal conduciveness, and value compatibility (Lazarus, 1992, 2006; Scherer, 2010). In this study, I position goal 
relevance, goal conduciveness, and value compatibility as key mechanisms involved in the appraisal process of technostress that 
influence how a nurse appraises a technology-related stressful event and decides how to categorize and label the event as a challenge or 
hindrance techno-stressor, and ultimately act on the event. Overall, the affordance and appraisal literature provide the vocabulary to 
theorize, investigate, and present an appraisal theory of technostress. 
The key concepts in the appraisal theory of technostress are applied to an interpretive case study of nurses’ use of EMRs in hospitals. 
Through the study, I offer a new conceptualization of the appraisal process of technostress that highlights the interrelationships among 
system features, affordances, user goals, and user values. The study demonstrates how goal relevance, goal conduciveness, and value 
compatibility play a critical role in the appraisal process of technostress in the context of nursing, and therefore helps to recognize how 
an individual appraises system features as a challenge or hindrance techno-stressors. Overall, the study shows: (1) how individuals can 
appraise the same system features differently; (2) how the alignment between an individual’s goals and values shapes whether a 
techno-stressor is considered a challenge or a hindrance; and (3) how appraisal involved in technostress is an ongoing and dynamic 
process. These findings enable me to develop and present a process model to illustrate the appraisal theory of technostress. IS re­
searchers and managers can use this study to identify how, given a particular situation, technology’s features may align or misalign 
with an individual’s goals and values, and therefore, recognize how technology may play a role in workplace stress and the emotional 
and mental well-being of employees, as well as contribute to positive and negative workplace outcomes. 
The paper begins by reviewing the literature on stress, technostress, affordances, and appraisal, and then discusses the key concepts 
of the appraisal theory of technostress. I then describe how these concepts are applied to the case study and present the results. The 
process model built from the case study, which illustrates the appraisal theory of technostress, is then presented. The contributions of 
the study to research and practice are then discussed. 
2. Theoretical background 
2.1. Stress 
Stress is often defined as an “ongoing process that involves individuals transacting with their environments” (Cooper, Dewe, & 
O’Driscoll, 2001, p. 12). During this process, an individual forms a relationship with the environment and appraises demanding events, 
or stressors, which emerge in the environment (Edwards, 1996; Hargrove, Nelson, & Cooper, 2013; McGrath, 1976). In an important 
study on organizational stress, McGrath (1976) argued that stressors emerge from three primary environmental systems: the social 
system, the psychological system (the individual), and the physical-technological system. The overlap of these three systems represents 
how the individual experiences several role-, task-, and technology-based stressors. It is through this ongoing individual-environment 
C.B. Califf

3
interaction that the individual and the environment are linked, and the process of stress occurs (Cooper et al., 2001). 
Conceptually, the process of stress involves five components: environmental conditions, stressors (i.e., demands, events, stressful 
situations), challenge and hindrance stressors, positive and negative psychological responses, and positive and negative outcomes 
(Hargrove et al., 2013). The stress process begins with the individual making sense of a demanding situation that occurs in an 
environment. The demanding situation is called a stressor. The environmental conditions shape how the individual appraises the 
stressor through an appraisal process (McGrath, 1976). The stressor is inherently neutral until it is appraised by the individual. Once 
appraised, it is categorized as related to a challenge or a hindrance (Cavanaugh, Boswell, Roehling, & Boudreau, 2000; LePine, 
Podsakoff, & LePine, 2005; Podsakoff, LePine, & LePine, 2007). A challenge stressor is defined as a “demand in the workplace that 
tends to be appraised as promoting the accomplishment of job tasks and the personal development of the individual” (Hargrove et al., 
2013, p. 62). A hindrance stressor is defined as a “demand in the workplace that tends to be appraised as a barrier or obstacle to the 
accomplishment of job tasks and personal development of the individual” (Hargrove et al., 2013, p. 62). 
Once the individual appraises, categorizes, and labels a stressor, they psychologically respond to the stressor and experience 
positive or negative emotions (Hargrove et al., 2013). Challenge stressors are typically related to positive emotions, such as hope, 
vigor, or meaningfulness, and tend to be linked to positive outcomes, such as good health or strong organizational commitment. 
Hindrance stressors are typically related to negative emotions, such as alienation or anger, and tend to be linked to negative outcomes 
such as low job satisfaction or low mental well-being (Hargrove et al., 2013). 
This holistic view of stress, as well as other process views of stress, emphasizes the importance of context and the situational nature 
of stressors (Cooper et al., 2001; Lazarus, 2006). In other words, the demanding events appraised by individuals are contextually and 
circumstantially shaped by environmental conditions. In this sense, understanding and identifying how the individual appraises the 
stressor as a challenge or a hindrance stressor strongly depends on the context and the workplace situations that trigger the process of 
appraising. Individuals, therefore, depending on the context or the situation shaping the appraisal process, could appraise the same 
stressor differently. 
2.2. Technostress 
Technostress has been defined as an “inability to adapt or cope with new ICTs in a healthy manner” (Tarafdar et al., 2007, p. 302). 
When defined this way, technostress is assumed to be negative. This definition guided initial IS research on technostress, which 
conceptualized it as five negatively laden technostress creators that induce negative outcomes, such as low job satisfaction and low 
organizational commitment (e.g., Ragu-Nathan et al., 2008). The five technostress creators, now called techno-stressors, include 
techno-overload, techno-invasion, techno-complexity, techno-insecurity, and techno-uncertainty (Ragu-Nathan et al., 2008; Tarafdar 
et al., 2007). Techno-overload occurs when technology forces individuals are forced to work faster. Techno-invasion is associated with 
the blurring of work and home life due to technology. Techno-complexity is linked to users feeling that their technology skills are 
inadequate. Techno-insecurity involves users feeling threatened about losing their job due to technology or to others with better 
technical knowledge. Techno-uncertainty is related to the constant changes and upgrades that occur due to technology (Ragu-Nathan 
et al., 2008; Tarafdar et al., 2007). 
Technostress has been recently re-conceptualized as involving positive and negative techno-stressors, psychological responses, and 
outcomes (Benlian, 2020; Califf, Sarker, Sarker, & Fitzgerald, 2015, Califf et al., 2020; Tarafdar, Cooper, & Stich, 2019). For example, 
in a conceptual paper on technostress, Tarafdar et al. (2019) argue that technostress involves two distinct stress processes that exist 
within the overarching process of technostress: techno-eustress and techno-distress. Techno-eustress is a process associated with the 
positive aspects of technostress and techno-distress is a process associated with the negative aspects of technostress. In a 
mixed-methods study on nurses and healthcare IT, Califf et al. (2020) adopted concepts from the holistic stress model (Hargrove et al., 
2013) and concepts from Tarafdar et al. (2019) to theorize and empirically validate a holistic technostress process model in the context 
of healthcare IT and nursing, and is, therefore, the theoretical foundation for the current study. Fig. 1 illustrates a streamlined con­
ceptual framework of the holistic technostress that guides this study. 
The holistic technostress process begins with the psycho-socio-technical environmental conditions governed by the three envi­
ronmental systems: the social system, the psychological system (the individual), and the physical-technological system (McGrath, 
1976). The interaction of these systems represents the environmental factors present for the technology-related stressful situations/ 
events or techno-stressors materialize. A technology-related stressful situation or techno-stressor is a demanding event that requires 
the individual’s attention and necessitates the individual to act on the event by using technology. The role of technology in the stressful 
event, and the information about the technology associated with the event, is initially neutral. This is because the information about 
the event and the role of technology related to the event have not yet been through a process of appraising (Califf et al., 2020; Tarafdar 
Fig. 1. The holistic technostress process.  
C.B. Califf

et al., 2019). The individual experiences these neutral technology-related stressful events and appraises the techno-stressor associated 
with the event through an appraisal process. In the appraisal process, the individual evaluates the technology in terms of its relatedness 
to promoting or obstructing task accomplishment (Califf et al., 2020). The outcome of the appraisal process, or the appraisal, occurs 
when the individual appraises the technology related to the stressful event by categorizing and labeling the technology as a challenge 
techno-stressor or a hindrance techno-stressor. The individual labels the technology in the stressful event as a challenge techno-stressor 
if the technology is appraised as related to promoting task accomplishment. The individual labels the technology in the stressful event 
as a hindrance techno-stressor if the technology is appraised as related to obstructing task accomplishment (Califf et al., 2020). The 
appraisal process also determines which subprocess the individual enters, either the techno-eustress subprocess, which comprises 
positive psychological responses and positive outcomes, or the techno-distress subprocess which encompasses negative psychological 
responses and negative outcomes. 
The holistic technostress process continues with the individual entering a decision process in which they evaluate their psycho­
logical response to the appraised techno-stressor. The product of the decision process is the psychological response, which is related to 
experiencing positive or negative emotions. Positive emotions tend to relate to the challenge techno-stressors and negative emotions 
tend to relate to the hindrance techno-stressors (Califf et al., 2020). The individual then enters a performance process in which they 
evaluate how to act on the emotions felt in the psychological response. The product of the performance process is the positive and 
negative individual and organizational outcomes, such as strain, job satisfaction, organizational commitment, and turnover intention, 
all of which impact outcomes like well-being or actual turnover (Califf et al., 2020; Ragu-Nathan et al., 2008; Tarafdar et al., 2019). 
How the individual appraises a neutral stressor as a challenge or a hindrance through the appraisal process is considered by stress 
researchers as critical to understanding the essence of the stress experience (Cooper et al., 2001; Hargrove et al., 2013). This is because 
the appraisal process sets in motion the rest of the stress process. For example, the appraisal shapes how the individual responds 
emotionally to a stressor, an emotional psychological response that influences workplace outcomes. In this sense, understanding what 
occurs in the appraisal process is critical to recognizing what events may lead to positive or negative emotional states, as well as 
uncovering how and why positive and negative individual and workplace outcomes may occur. The appraisal process involved in 
technostress is, unfortunately, not well understood. This paper focuses on conceptualizing and investigating what occurs in the 
appraisal process of technostress by applying the lens and vocabulary of affordances and dimensions of appraisal theory to the process. 
2.3. Affordances 
Affordances were introduced by Gibson (1977) in the context of ecological psychology as a lens to identify how the environment 
offers potential actions. Gibson (1979) defined affordances as what the environment “offers the animal, what it provides or furnishes 
for good or for ill” (p. 127). Gibson argued that researchers should depart from only investigating the attributes of the individual, and 
instead, examine how the environment affords and shapes the action possibilities of the individual (Natsoulas, 2004). IS researchers 
have adopted and applied affordances to IS phenomena (Cheikh-Ammar, 2018; Fayard & Weeks, 2014; Markus & Silver, 2008; Robey, 
Raymond, & Anderson, 2012). By viewing IS phenomena through the lens of affordances, IS researchers treat technology as a material 
artifact comprised of features that offer, provide, or afford the individual opportunities for action (Fayard & Weeks, 2014). IS re­
searchers can use affordances to reveal more about the user’s contextual relationship with the artifact (Faraj & Azad, 2012; Majchrzak, 
Faraj, Kane, & Azad, 2013; Majchrzak & Markus, 2012). 
There has been some disagreement on how to interpret affordances in IS research—as either dispositional or relational (Faraj & 
Azad, 2012). As dispositional, affordances are considered “visible and directly linked to practice when perceived” (Fayard & Weeks, 
2014, p. 243). As relational, affordances “depend on the relation between an individual’s goals, the material properties of a tech­
nology, and the organizational context in which the technology is used” (Fayard & Weeks, 2014, p. 243). This paper adopts the 
relational view of affordances and is guided by research that has used relational affordances in the context of healthcare to study care 
providers (e.g., Anderson & Robey, 2017; Strong et al., 2014). 
Several mechanisms shape how the user relates to and acts on the action possibilities offered by a material artifact (Strong et al., 
2014). In this paper, I focus on the following four mechanisms in order to recognize how a nurse relates to and potentially acts on the 
affordances of an EMR system: the features of the system, the user’s goals, the user’s values, and the conditions of the workplace 
environment (Anderson & Robey, 2017; Cheikh-Ammar, 2018; Fayard & Weeks, 2014; Gaver, 1991, 1996; Strong et al., 2014). 
The features of the system have been defined as “central components of an IT artifact shaping the variety of possible outcomes of its 
use” (Cheikh-Ammar, 2018). When identifying the features, the user associates the features with an action potential (Al-Natour & 
Benbasat, 2009) and may articulate or discuss them in terms of the tasks they enable (Goodhue & Thompson, 1995). In the context of 
healthcare, IS researchers have identified several features of EMR systems related to their action possibilities. For example, Strong et al. 
(2014) label several features of an EMR system, such as a common database, structured data entry forms, patient information that is 
stored and available anytime, and restricted access to the EMR system, among others. 
Goals and values are also fundamental mechanisms that shape how and why individuals use technology and form relationships with 
technology in terms of potential action (Cheikh-Ammar, 2018; DeSanctis & Poole, 1994). IS scholars have historically discussed goals 
and values when examining the IT artifact’s structural features and spirit (Markus & Silver, 2008). IT Spirit is defined as “the general 
intent with regard to values and goals underlying a given set of structural features” (DeSanctis & Poole, 1994, p. 126). When treated as 
a component of spirit, goals and values are typically associated with the designer’s and the organization’s intended goals and values 
(Markus & Silver, 2008). In this vein, goals and values have historically represented a property of the artifact. 
In recent IS research, goals are characterized as action-oriented goals which shape how a user acts on the action possibilities offered 
by the artifact (Cheikh-Ammar, 2018; Leonardi, 2011; Strong et al., 2014). For example, in a study in the context of care providers 
C.B. Califf

using an EMR system, Strong et al. (2014) recognized that the user’s goals and goal-oriented actions are an important part of the 
affordance actualization process. In their work, the authors theorize an affordance actualization process in which the user is treated as 
a goal-oriented actor that actualizes action possibilities (i.e., affordances) as shaped by goals. Likewise, values also motivate and justify 
action and action possibilities (Schwartz, 1994). In a recent conceptual paper on affordances, Cheikh-Ammar (2018) emphasizes the 
importance of the user’s values related to acting on affordances, which, they define as relationally dependent action possibilities. 
Values are regarded as mechanisms that “do not stem directly from the features themselves but are instead rooted in the enactment of 
action possibilities made possible by an IT artifact” (Cheikh-Ammar, 2018, p. 286). In this sense, just as goals have been considered 
goal-oriented actions made by goal-oriented actors that shape how affordances are actualized (Strong et al., 2014), values, too, can be 
considered value-oriented actions made by value-oriented actors that shape, motivate, and justify how an individual carries out their 
actions. The characteristics of the work environment, or conditions of the environment shaping a necessary action, also influence how 
an individual relates to and acts on an affordance (Fayard & Weeks, 2014). In this sense, understanding the psychological, sociological, 
and technological conditions involved in a potential action is a critical part of how an individual relates to and acts on an affordance 
(Anderson & Robey, 2017). 
While the literature on affordances provides the vocabulary needed to recognize how a user relates to and potentially acts through 
technology in terms of the system’s features and the user’s goals and values, all conditioned by the environmental conditions shaping 
the event necessitating action, it does not provide the language needed to investigate how the user assesses and processes information 
related to their own goals and values as related to the potential action through the system features. For example, the affordance 
literature does not provide the concepts needed to understand how an individual processes the information related to the event and the 
action potential in terms of aligning with their specific goals and values. To recognize how the individual processes the information 
associated with an event that necessitates action, and how the individual uses that information to evaluate and act on several action 
possibilities afforded by the features of an artifact, particularly in terms of the individual’s goals and values, concepts from appraisal 
theory are adopted. 
2.4. Appraisal 
Appraisal theory, originally called cognitive theory, was developed by Arnold (1950, 1960), who found that the appraisal of an 
event involves processing information about potential actions related to the event, as well as the emotional experiences of the indi­
vidual, both of which lead to action (Scherer, 2010). Richard Lazarus adopted the term appraisal from Arnold (1960) work. Lazarus 
stated that it “seemed quite relevant to psychological stress” (Lazarus, 2006, p. 40). This eventually led Lazarus to develop his appraisal 
theory related to psychological stress, which is commonly used in many disciplines today (e.g., Lazarus & Folkman, 1984). 
In Lazarus’ appraisal theory, which has been labeled as a structural appraisal theory (not a process appraisal theory), the individual 
experiences two appraisals: primary appraising and secondary appraising. In the primary process of appraising, the individual eval­
uates “whether or not what is happening is relevant to one’s values, goal commitments, beliefs about self and world, and situational 
intentions” (Lazarus, 2006, p. 42). In the secondary process of appraising, the individual determines one’s coping options to decide 
which ones to act on (D’Arcy, Herath, & Shoss, 2014; Lazarus & Launier, 1978; Stein, Newell, Wagner, & Galliers, 2015). It should be 
noted that Lazarus considers the term appraising related to the individual act of making an evaluation, and the term appraisal as the 
evaluative product (Lazarus, 2006). 
While Lazarus’ work on appraisal has been widely used, it does not capture the dynamic nature of appraisal and stress related to the 
individual evaluating how to act on an event (Marsella & Gratch, 2009). Likewise, there is not much specific guidance on how to 
identify if an event is relevant to one’s values and goals. Therefore, I adopt elements of the component process model (CPM) (Scherer, 
2010), which takes the processual approach to appraisal, and provides the language needed to identify how an individual processes 
information about an event as related to their goals and values. The CPM assumes that an actionable situation or event requires the 
attention of the individual, and that the individual interprets how to act on the event in terms of his or her goals and values. The CPM is 
a process model that begins with a situation or event that is “highly pertinent to the needs, goals, and values of an individual” (Scherer, 
2010, p. 49). Once the event occurs, the individual enters the appraisal module, which is comprised of multiple appraisal checks that 
shape how an individual processes information related to the event. When appraising, the individual experiences four appraisal ob­
jectives, each with several appraisal checks related to how the goals and values of the individual impact appraising the event. 
Central to the current paper is the focus on the appraisal checks related to the individual’s goals and values in terms of acting on an 
event. The key appraisal checks adopted in this paper are goal relevance, goal conduciveness, and value compatibility. Goal relevance is 
the first appraisal check experienced by the individual. It is defined as “how strongly an event affects an individual’s momentary goals” 
(Kreibig, Gendolla, & Scherer, 2012, p. 365). Scherer (2010) states that “the essential task of this check is to rapidly determine the 
potential goal relevance of an event in order to allocate attention and invest further processing capability” (p. 52). Goal relevance 
varies in strength from low to high. If the individual determines that the information about the event aligns with their immediate goals, 
the event has high goal relevance; if the individual determines that the information about the event does not align with their immediate 
goals, the event has low goal relevance (Scherer, 2010). After determining the relevance of the event to one’s immediate goals, the 
individual enters another appraisal check to appraise the event’s goal conduciveness. 
Goal conduciveness, which is also called goal congruence or motivational valence (Frijda, 1986), occurs when the individual 
“evaluates in what way the event affects the individual’s goals (Kreibig et al., 2012, p. 365). To determine the strength of goal 
conduciveness, the individual compares the actual or encountered event and its associated potential actions to those desired by the 
individual (Scherer, 2010). As Scherer (2010) states: “the more an action or an event contributes to goal attainment, directly or 
indirectly, the higher its goal/need conduciveness” (p., 53). If the characteristics of the encountered event and its associated potential 
C.B. Califf

actions align with goals and actions desired by the individual, the event/action has high goal conduciveness; however, if the char­
acteristics of the encountered event and its associated potential actions do not align with the goals and actions desired by the indi­
vidual, the event/action has low goal conduciveness and is regarded as goal obstructive. After determining the event’s goal 
conduciveness, the individual enters a third appraisal check known as value compatibility. 
Value compatibility occurs when the individual determines whether the characteristics of the event or potential action align with 
their internal and/or external moral code, or in other words, their values (Scherer, 2010). Internal values represent how the action is 
related to the individual’s ideal self and their obligatory conduct in terms of the contextual environment in which the action will occur. 
External values represent whether the action aligns with the perceived norms of the reference group in terms of the contextual 
environment in which the action will occur. If the potential action aligns with the values revered by the individual, the action has high 
value compatibility; if the action does not align with the values revered by the individual, the action has low value compatibility. 
After these appraisal checks occur, the individual categorizes and labels the event. Scherer (2010) discusses that the labels 
themselves may be “fuzzy” until repeated events enable the individual to form more distinct categorizations about the events. In this 
paper, these “fuzzy labels” represent the appraisal, which is the outcome of the three appraisal checks. This appraisal represents how 
the individual categorizes and labels the technology associated with a demanding or stressful event as a challenge or hindrance techno- 
stressor. 
Together, the literature on technostress, affordances, and appraisal offers a foundation on which to build an appraisal theory of 
technostress. More specifically, the literature enables me to investigate how nurses process information about a technology-related 
stressful event that necessitates action through an EMR system’s implemented system features in terms of goal relevance, goal 
conduciveness, and value compatibility. Moreover, the literature provides the vocabulary needed to identify how the action possi­
bilities afforded by EMR’s implemented system features are categorized and labeled by the user as a challenge or a hindrance techno- 
stressor, defined in terms of related to promoting or obstructing the accomplishment of a task, i.e., whether the affordances align or 
misalign with goal relevance, goal conduciveness, and value compatibility. 
To develop these ideas empirically, I conducted a case study of nurses using an EMR system in a hospital environment. The details 
of the research method guiding the case study are discussed in the next section. 
3. Research setting, design, and method 
3.1. Research context and design 
The current study aims to identify and understand specific EMR-related stressful events, the environmental conditions that shape 
the events, action possibilities afforded by the system features, and information about care-oriented goals and care-related values, all 
from the perspective of individual nurses. Consequently, a qualitative, interpretive case study approach was employed (Kotlarsky & 
Oshri, 2005; Myers, 2008; Novak, Brooks, Gadd, Anders, & Lorenzi, 2012; Sarker, Xiao, Beaulieu, & Lee, 2018a, 2018b; Walsham, 
1995, 2006). This also follows calls by psychological stress researchers to use methods “that capture the richness of the process and the 
ideographic nature of the experience” (Cooper et al., 2001, p. 219). 
Since the implementation of EMR systems, nurses have reported feeling stressed. For example, nurses may consider EMR systems 
related to high time pressure, unreliable, not user-friendly, associated with a higher workload, and reducing the amount of quality time 
spent with patients (Vehko et al., 2019; Yen et al., 2016). Nurses use EMR systems to achieve a variety of care-related goals. In IS 
research on nursing, goals have been identified as high-level goals such as providing high quality, safe, and timely care (Strong et al., 
2014). However, nursing research suggests that care-related goals are much more specific and are dependent on the situation (Chianca 
et al., 2012). For example, Chianca et al. (2012), in a study on nurses who work in the intensive care unit mapped the North American 
Nursing Diagnosis Association (NANDA) International standard diagnoses to 59 specific care-related goals.1 If a patient is diagnosed 
with anxiety, for example, the care-related goal is “anxiety levels will be alleviated during the hospitalization.” Nurses also have 
several care-related values that impact how they deliver care. For example, Rassin (2008) surveyed 323 hospital nurses to investigate 
how they rate the importance of professional values and ranked the ratings from most important to least important. The professional 
values used by Rassin (2008) were based on the International Council of Nursing’s Code of Ethics, which is a “guide for action based on 
social values.”2 The top five ranked care-related values are: (1) human dignity (awareness and honoring the patient’s values and 
beliefs), (2) equality among patients, (3) prevention of suffering, (4) reliability (nurses must report any mistake they make and be held 
responsible for their actions), (5) autonomy of the patient (a patient has the right to receive information related to his or her diagnosis, 
treatment, and prognosis) (Rassin, 2008). 
The case study was conducted in two hospitals in the United States from 2012 to 2014. One hospital had about a 600-bed capacity, 
while the other had about a 300-bed capacity. The hospitals were a part of the same healthcare network. The hospitals were chosen 
because of recent reports of turnover among nurses, who cited the use of an EMR system as a reason for quitting or early retirement. 
The EMR system in use, hereafter referred to as CareTech (a pseudonym), was implemented in both hospitals at the time of the study. 
One hospital used version five and the other used version six. The versions were similar in appearance and features.

3.2. Data collection 
Four rounds of interviews were conducted and a total of 32 nurses were interviewed. Appendix 1 contains more information about 
the interviewees. Nurses worked a variety of hospital units in a variety of roles (e.g., full-time and part-time; day, evening, or night 
shift). Nurses were recruited by members of a nursing research committee who distributed information about a study on stress in 
healthcare. Nurses were asked to participate if they were currently employed in a full-time or part-time position and providing direct 
care to patients. A snowball technique was also used to obtain additional interviewees after the first round of interviews. The interview 
time ranged from 15 min to approximately an hour. Interviews were audiotaped and transcribed if permission was given. 
The interview questions were guided by several principles for interpretive research (Klein & Myers, 1999; Sarker et al., 2018a, 
2018b; Sarker, Xiao, & Beaulieu, 2013; Walsham, 2006). The interview questions can be found in Appendix 2. The role of a “neutral 
outside researcher” (Walsham, 1995), or a “neutral observer” (Walsham, 2006) was adopted. An informant helped gain access to the 
hospitals. Initial interview questions focused on the job responsibilities of each nurse, the hospital’s context in which actions occurred 
(what happens during a given situation), how nurses used CareTech, and what the nurses preferred or did not prefer about CareTech. 
After the initial rounds of interviews, questions were more focused on emerging concepts. For example, nurses were encouraged to 
describe the features of CareTech they use most often as related to carrying out tasks and were asked to reflect on stressful situations 
and events involving the role CareTech played in those situations. A hospital administrator also shared screenshots of CareTech and 
gave a live demonstration of CareTech to the author. 
3.3. Data analysis 
Several concepts were used to analyze and code the data in an abductive and iterative manner (i.e., the concepts described pre­
viously about technostress, affordances, and appraisal theory). Table 1 provides a summary and definitions of the guiding theoretical 
dimensions that were used to analyze the data. 
Overall, the holistic technostress process model was used to frame the study as technostress and focus on investigating the appraisal 
process. The model also provides the high-level definitions (without reference to goals and values) associated with the challenge and 
hindrance techno-stressors (Califf et al., 2020). The specific affordances used to analyze the data were based on ones found by 
Anderson and Robey (2017) and Strong et al. (2014) affordances. These include accessing and reviewing patient data, capturing and 
archiving patient data, coordinating care, and administering and validating medications. To provide insight into the key mechanisms 
involved in the appraisal process, and how a technology-related stressful event formed into a challenge or hindrance stressor, the three 
appraisal checks and their associated definitions discussed earlier—goal relevance, goal conduciveness, and value compatibili­
ty—were adopted and applied to the data (Scherer, 2010). A challenge techno-stressor was coded if the system features afforded action 
possibilities that aligned with goal relevance, goal conduciveness, and value compatibility; a hindrance techno-stressor was coded if 
implemented system features afforded action possibilities that misaligned with goal relevance, goal conduciveness, and value 
compatibility. In terms of goals and values, the data was viewed as related to the care-oriented goals and care-oriented values that 
relate to potential action. Chianca et al. (2012) and Rassin (2008) work on care-related goals and care-related professional nursing 
values were used as the inspiration to determine relevant goals and values. 
The above concepts also enabled me to develop the appraisal theory of technostress as a process model, which is presented in the 
discussion. Initially, concepts from the holistic technostress process model (Califf et al., 2020) were used to frame technostress in terms 
of environmental conditions and a technology-related stressful event leading to a positive or negative appraisal, labeled as a challenge 
or hindrance techno-stressor. Then, further data analysis and exposure to the affordance literature led to expanding the model to

Concepts and definitions from the literature review applied to the data analysis.  
Concept 
Description 
Environmental Conditions 
The conditions of the workplace or environment that materialize into a stressful situation/event. 
Technology-related Stressful 
Event 
A demanding event or situation, shaped by the environmental conditions, that requires the user’s attention and urges or demands 
the user to act, or anticipate acting, through the action possibilities afforded by implemented system features. 
Implemented System Features 
The implemented system features of the artifact in-use that shape the action possibilities. 
Affordances 
The relational action possibilities offered by the implemented system features. 
Appraisal Process 
The process through which relevant information about the technology-related stressful event and affordance is evaluated. The 
appraisal process involves three appraisal checks related to the action possibilities: goal relevance, goal conduciveness, and value 
compatibility. 
Goals 
Action-oriented goals that motivate and direct the individual’s urge, need, or desire to act. 
Values 
Action-oriented internal and/or external values that motivate and direct the individual’s urge, need, or desire to act. 
Appraisal 
The evaluative product of the appraisal process. The appraisal includes how the individual categorizes and labels the system 
features in use based on the strength of goal relevance, goal conduciveness, and value compatibility through repeated use, 
interactions, and events. 
Challenge Techno-stressor 
How the action possibilities afforded by the implemented system feature(s) are categorized and labeled by the user as related to 
promoting the accomplishment of a task, defined in terms of the affordances aligning with goal relevance, goal conduciveness, 
and value compatibility. 
Hindrance Techno-stressor 
How the action possibilities afforded by the implemented system feature(s) are categorized and labeled by the user as related to 
obstructing the accomplishment of a task, defined in terms of the affordances misaligning with goal relevance, goal 
conduciveness, and value compatibility.

include the appraisal process being shaped by action possibilities as related to potentially acting through the implemented system 
features of the EMR system. Next, concepts embedded in appraisal theory gave the terminology to identify and depict how a user 
processes, categorizes, and labels information related to an event and information related to the action possibilities in terms of goal 
relevance, goal conduciveness, and value compatibility. The empirical foundation of the model is considered in the next section. 
4. Results 
The results are presented from the perspective of individual nurses. The findings are guided by three work practices: charting, 
medication pass, and continuity of care, and four affordances: capturing and archiving patient data, accessing and reviewing patient 
history, administering and validating medications, and coordinating care. More details about the affordances used in this study are 
presented below, as are the study’s findings. 
4.1. Charting 
Charting is an overarching work practice that encompasses protocols related to documenting patient information (Anderson & 
Robey, 2017). Two affordances were analyzed under the practice of charting: (1) capturing and archiving patient data and (2) 
accessing and reviewing a patient’s history. Capturing and archiving patient data occurs when nurses use CareTech to gather and 
document information about a patient during the patient’s stay. The data needing to be captured and archived depends on the situ­
ation. For example, if needing to capture and archive data when admitting a patient, the nurse may need to capture more information 
than if updating a patient’s status throughout their visit. Another common affordance related to charting is accessing and reviewing a 
patient’s history (i.e., looking up a patient’s medical history). These two affordances can occur during the same charting session or 
separately. When admitting or assessing a patient, for example, a nurse may retrieve a patient’s medical history and make sense of it 
before capturing and archiving current data and may use the stored data to inform the patient assessment. Capturing and archiving 
patient data and accessing and reviewing a patient’s history both occur through structured features implemented in CareTech. For 
example, a nurse can review a patient’s history through the Patient Summary module and can begin capturing and archiving patient 
data by accessing the Document module. CareTech’s software is designed so that archiving and reviewing patient data occurs through 
point-and-click features such as radio buttons, drop-down menus, and checkboxes. 
The following examples depict how nurses appraise the features that afford capturing and archiving patient data and accessing and 
reviewing patient data as challenge or hindrance techno-stressors in terms of goal relevance, goal conduciveness, and value 
compatibility. 
4.1.1. Challenge techno-stressor 
Several nurses discussed CareTech’s features in terms of the action possibilities related to capturing and archiving patient data, and 
accessing and reviewing patient data, in terms of aligning with their care-related goals and values. Consider the example from a staff 
nurse who works the “graveyard shift” (i.e., night shift). She describes a technology-related stressful event about admitting a patient 
who recently suffered a stroke. The patient was with his wife at the time. 
Two nights ago, I had a patient who was readmitted for a totally different reason than what they had been discharged for. The 
patient was not able to talk because she had a stroke. Her husband had been up since five that morning and it was two in the 
morning or something like that. – Nurse 11, Staff Nurse. 
The nurse recalls that her goal was to try to admit her patient as quickly and accurately as possible so that her patient (and the 
patient’s husband) could get some much-needed rest. She was concerned that, since her patient could not speak, she may not be able to 
correctly and promptly answer the questions required by CareTech. Her patient’s husband said he would do the best he could to answer 
the questions on his wife’s behalf, but the nurse knew that he was exhausted. 
Like many other nurses, the staff nurse wanted to prevent her patient from suffering, which is a core value many nurses share 
(Rassin, 2008). She also valued building a trusting relationship with her patients and their family members, often by showing 
compassion by talking with them and comforting them at the bedside. Therefore, during situations such as this one, she felt like the 
requirement to spend a lot of time capturing and archiving an abundance of information required by CareTech took time away from her 
patient and her patient’s husband, therefore misaligning with her core values. 
When you go into a room you feel like you’re glued to the computer when you would want to be bedside and care for the patient. 
It’s like we’ve been drawn from the patient … I think the biggest thing is that we got into [nursing] because we want to care for 
the patient. We want to give that bedside compassion and feeling and it’s about them; it’s not about the system. – Nurse 11, Staff 
Nurse. 
For the specific situation involving the stroke patient and the patient’s husband, however, the nurse realized that her patient was a 
readmit, meaning that her patient had been admitted to the hospital in the past. The staff nurse was therefore hopeful that some of the 
information she needed to document was stored in CareTech. If it was, she could use CareTech to update the information about her 
patient quickly and accurately, and give her patient and the patient’s husband the rest they needed. 
When I knew that she had been in this system before, I thought, a lot of this information has to be in [CareTech]. If I quickly just 
ask him these questions, [the admission process] will go much faster. Sure enough, all the home medications were in there. I

asked him briefly: “Is she still on these?” “Did she take her medications today as scheduled?” Then we were done with that 
section. It was all in the system and so it worked so much faster. – Nurse 11, Staff Nurse. 
Since there was information already stored in CareTech, the nurse appraised the features of CareTech as relevant and conducive to 
her goal to admit her patient quickly and accurately. She expressed gratitude that the features of CareTech enabled her to easily access 
and retrieve information archived in CareTech. She also appraised the features as ones that offered action possibilities compatible with 
her care-related values: to prevent her patient and patient’s husband from suffering by letting them get the rest they needed; and to 
build a trusting relationship with her patient and her patient’s husband by including the husband in his wife’s care. Therefore, in this 
situation, the nurse appraised the features of CareTech as aligned with her care-related goals and values (i.e., as a challenge techno- 
stressor). 
… There was so much information already in [CareTech]. I was able to get the patient resting and then the husband to be able to 
go home and sleep. [CareTech] worked so well and I was so grateful that that [the information] was in the system. The 
technology was there for me to help him be able to get out easier and the patient to be able to rest because that’s the number one 
thing that she needed with her condition. – Nurse 11, Staff Nurse. 
4.1.2. Hindrance techno-stressor 
Nurses also described CareTech’s features in terms of capturing and archiving patient data, and accessing and reviewing patient 
data, as misaligning with their care-related goals and values. Consider the following technology-related stressful situation shared by a 
nurse who works in the adolescent and child psychology unit. When asked how CareTech affected her, she gave the example of a 
common situation involving a child (i.e., “kiddo”) who may misbehave during a group therapy session. 
A general thing is a kiddo who is acting out. They act out in various ways like striking a kid during group therapy, hitting. 
They’re dangerous or they’re disruptive. – Nurse_9, Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Unit. 
The nurse elaborated by saying that when situations like these arise her immediate care-related goal is to calm the child down. Once 
the child is calm, she tries to involve them in their care by having the child choose the next step. For example, the child can choose to go 
back into group therapy or to go into the observation room. Including patients in their care involves the following care-related values: 
human dignity, patient autonomy, and building a trusting relationship with a patient (Rassin, 2008). 
The nurse also described the role of CareTech when a child misbehaves. She said that she is required to capture and archive as many 
details as possible about situations like these. For example, she should document information about what the child did, what she said to 
the child, how the child behaved, and her assessment of the child’s mental and emotional state before, during, and after the event, 
among other information. She also felt that documenting all of that information in CareTech often rushed her quality time with her 
patients, and often rushed the decision-making process related to choosing their next steps. She said that rushing that decision-making 
process can even prompt her patients to exhibit worse behavior. 
I’ve always got this ticking clock in my head. I still have to do x, x, and x [in CareTech]. There have been times where you push 
that kiddo to make that choice. Not give them enough time because you got that ticking clock in your head. They get upset and 
they escalate further because you’re not giving them enough time to make that choice. Sometimes that’s a lengthy process for 
some of these little kiddos who have anger issues, who don’t know how to work through their problem. – Nurse_9, Child and 
Adolescent Psychiatric Unit. 
When reflecting on her goals and values, the child and adolescent psychiatric nurse emphasized that the main reason she got into 
nursing was to care for her patients by spending one-on-one time with them, and underscored that she never expected to “sit at a 
computer” documenting different situations. She acknowledged that capturing and archiving patient information is beneficial for the 
patient and may provide better quality care in the long run. However, given her immediate care-related goals and values, she tended to 
appraise CareTech as misaligning with her care-related goals and values. 
… I don’t think you ever plan on sitting at a computer as much as you do … The documentation piece takes away from our 
interacting with the patients … I think [the documentation] affects the one-on-one with my patient because I am sort of pushing 
that process that shouldn’t be pushed. … I understand the reason for documenting … but I have to give this kiddo the time that 
they need. The computer stuff has to be less important … less important than the person … I have to just take the clock away. – 
Nurse_9, Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Unit. 
4.2. Medication pass 
Several nurses said they use CareTech to administer and validate medications. This affordance falls under the work practice of passing 
medications, or medication pass, which involves steps and protocols designed into CareTech so that care providers can safely 
administer and validate medications (Anderson & Robey, 2017). The relevant features involved in this affordance include those 
embedded in the software (i.e., radio buttons, checkboxes, scroll bar), as well as hardware such as a computer mouse, keyboard, 
medication barcode scanner, and a medication dispensing system called the MedStation (a pseudonym). When administering and 
validating medications, a nurse may interact with several care providers and other individuals (e.g., doctors, patients, patients’ family 
members, and pharmacists) either face-to-face or through CareTech.

When administering and validating medications, a nurse uses the Medication Administration Record, or “the MAR” module in 
CareTech. The MAR enables a nurse to view the details associated with a patient’s medication information (e.g., the name of the 
medication, the dosage of a medication, the time a medication was last administered, and a list of previously administered medica­
tions, etc.). A nurse can also enter and update patient medications and dosages through the MAR. The process typically begins with a 
doctor giving a nurse a medication order, either in person or by recoding it in CareTech. A doctor can also update a patient’s MAR and 
send an order to the pharmacy for approval, and often does so without talking to a nurse. Before retrieving the medication, a nurse 
must get approval from the pharmacist, who either approves or rejects the medication order. This occurs by sending information to the 
on-site pharmacist through CareTech, who either approves or rejects the medication order. Once the order is approved, a nurse re­
trieves the medication from the MedStation, a medication storage and dispensing system and machine that is integrated with the MAR. 
A nurse then carries the medication into a patient’s room. A nurse uses a bedside medication verification scanner (a barcode scanner 
integrated into the MAR) to scan the barcode on a patient’s wristband and scan the barcode on the medication. Once scanned, a nurse 
waits for CareTech to confirm a match. A match involves aligning patient information such as a hospital ID number, medication ID, 
dosage, and time for the medication to be administered, among other information. After receiving a confirmation, a nurse may then 
proceed to open the medication and administer it to the patient. Oftentimes a patient’s medication is not approved. A nurse must then 
troubleshoot errors in the previous process before the medication can be administered and repeat the process. 
The following examples show how nurses appraise the features that afford administering and validating medications as challenge 
or hindrance techno-stressors in terms of goal relevance, goal conduciveness, and value compatibility. 
4.2.1. Challenge techno-stressor 
Several nurses appraised the features of CareTech associated with administering and validating medications as aligning with care- 
related goals and values. One nurse, who works in the critical care unit, gave a specific example of a technology-related stressful 
situation involving almost giving the wrong dose of high blood pressure (HBP) medication to a patient. When starting her shift, she 
explains, before talking to her patients, she often reviews each patient’s MAR from her unit’s nursing station. This enables her to 
identify what medications her patients are currently on, what medications her patients need, what time she needs to administer them, 
and so on. 
I’ll give you an exact scenario. I checked my medication administration record or my MAR out in the nurses’ station. I know 
which medication I’m supposed to give my patient. I know what doses. – Nurse 17, Critical Care Unit. 
She went on to describe specific information about the technology-related stressful event and the role CareTech played. She says 
that during her patient review, she noticed that one of her patients needed to take a high blood pressure (HBP) pill soon. But she still 
had time before administering it. 
I go to the [MedStation], pull the medication, and I go into the room. After I introduce myself and talk to the patient, and do my 
morning assessment and whatnot, I left my patient. I see all my patients for exams. – Nurse 17, Critical Care Unit. 
She went on to say that when she was examining her other patients, the cardiologist made their rounds and examined the patient 
who needed the HBP medication. After the exam, the cardiologist changed the dose of the medication. Since she was not in the pa­
tient’s room during the cardiologist’s assessment, she was unaware of the medication change. She then walked into the patient’s room 
with the HBP medication she retrieved earlier. The cardiologist had already left. 
My patient has a 12.5 mg tablet [of a HBP medication] that he takes in the morning. But from the time that I have looked at my 
MAR out in the nurses’ station, got my meds out of the MedStation, and gone into my patients’ rooms, assessed them, and had a 
conversation with them […] In that timeframe, the cardiologist had come on to the unit, and I didn’t know. [The cardiologist] 
increased the dose or they decreased the dose. – Nurse 17, Critical Care Unit. 
The nurse says that she then scanned the barcode on the patient’s hospital bracelet, and the barcode on the package of the HBP 
medication, and waited for CareTech to approve the pill. CareTech gave her a notification that her medication was incorrect. 
I’m now scanning my medication […] and [CareTech] says this is not on my patient’s medication list. I know it is. I just looked 
at it. That’s my red flag that goes, okay, something is up. – Nurse 17, Critical Care Unit. 
When recalling the situation, and the role the features of CareTech played in this situation, she says that without CareTech, and 
giving up some control to the safety mechanisms designed into CareTech as related to administering medications, she would have 
given her patient the wrong dose of the HBP medication. In this situation, she appraised the safety features involved in administering 
medications as relevant and conducive to her goal to give her patients the correct medication. 
For me, it wouldn’t be caught any other way. I would have given the [wrong] dose if I didn’t have that electronic MAR. [I would 
have] given the wrong dose then come out and seeing that the doctor’s order of this change had already taken place. – Nurse 17, 
Critical Care Unit. 
The nurse also reflected on her values related to nursing and the role of CareTech in stressful situations such as these. She 
mentioned that she values the safety of her patients in terms of administering the correct medicine and dosage, particularly in the 
critical care unit.

[CareTech] is a safety net for sure … You can never be too safe when taking care of people’s lives. And on my unit, they are 
really sick. A small set of [medication] changes make a huge difference. I appreciate any extra safety measures to double-check 
me. – Nurse 17, Critical Care Unit. 
In this situation, the features of CareTech related to giving up some autonomy over the administration process promoted goal 
relevance and goal conduciveness because they offered her the ability to administer and validate medications safely, and she preferred 
the “safety net” associated with the affordance. CareTech also aligned with her values of quality and safe patient care, a common 
professional value shared by nurses (Rassin, 2008). 
4.2.2. Hindrance techno-stressor 
Nurses also appraised CareTech in terms of administering and validating medications as misaligning with goal relevance, goal 
conduciveness, and value compatibility. A nurse in the critical care unit, the same unit as the nurse in the previous situation, shared 
how he tends to associate administering and validating medications and the lack of control with a lengthy process that involves 
multiple steps. 
The pharmacist looks at [the medicine], makes sure that it’s appropriate for the patient; no allergy problems, no interactions … 
That comes back up on our screen up here for us to have to review. You have to acknowledge the med, get the med out of the 
Pyxis, or wait for it to come from the pharmacy, take it in the room, log in to the computer. – Nurse 20, Critical Care Unit. 
He views CareTech’s role in this lengthy process as associated with promoting quality and safe care, one of his core care-related 
values. However, even though he values safe and quality patient care, he associates CareTech’s safety features with a frustrating 
wait time hindering his immediate care-related goals and values. 
For safety reasons, you can’t administer a medication until you scan the patient and then the med because [CareTech] double- 
checks that it’s the right patient, the right med, the right timing, [and] all sorts of the medication rights … If I had to pick one 
thing that frustrated me the most is the wait time. – Nurse 20, Critical Care Unit. 
He elaborates on his frustration with the wait time through an example of administering pain medication to a patient who is “dying 
of pain.” His care-related goal in that situation was to prevent his patient from suffering. His frustration specifically involves CareTech 
obstructing his ability to administer medication promptly, therefore contributing to the patient’s suffering. Sometimes, he says, he 
waits for close to 10 min before CareTech enables him to give medication, though he mentions that the wait time often varied, an 
uncertainty which also contributes to the frustration. He emphasized that in critical care, a few minutes (and especially 10 min) feels 
like much too long to wait to give a suffering patient their medicine. 
Overall, when using CareTech to administer and validate medications, the critical care nurse tends to appraise the safety features 
associated with CareTech in terms of affording the ability to administer and validate medications as misaligning with his care-related 
goal to give his patient medications promptly, especially when they are in pain, and misaligning with his values to provide quality and 
safe care and to prevent his patients from suffering. At the end of the interview, the critical care nurse reflected on CareTech and 
patient care. He says that he associates CareTech with taking too much time to accomplish tasks, such as administering medications, 
which takes away from patient care. 
We do all this stuff on the computer, but how long is that going to take us? That is frustrating, yeah, because my job is to take 
care of this person, not satisfy the computer requirements. If you spend more time on the computer, telling it the things that you 
should be doing to your patient, your patient’s going to suffer … I will say that it’s definitely getting in the way [of patient care]. 
– Nurse 20, Critical Care Unit. 
4.3. Continuity of care 
Nurses described several technology-related stressful situations related to using CareTech coordinate care. This falls under work 
practice called continuity of care, transferring care, or handoff (Anderson & Robey, 2017). Coordinating care has also been described 
as “coordinating patient care across sites, facilities, and providers” (Strong et al., 2014). When coordinating care, nurses use the 
features of CareTech to ensure that they document patient information so that it is available to everyone in a uniform way, such as care 
providers, hospitals, private practices, and other stakeholders. In this way, patient data can be passed to other care providers and 
stored legibly and comprehensively. 
Nurses typically coordinate care in two ways: through CareTech and by exchanging information with their fellow team members. 
When coordinating care through CareTech, nurses typically use CareTech to review data about their assigned patients, called a patient 
summary. Depending on the unit, nurses review data that includes demographic information, the patient’s previous vital signs, 
medications taken and needed, and any active symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, and so on. The data they use to obtain 
a patient summary is typically captured and archived by another care provider (e.g., nurse, doctor, and so on), though, when they 
chart, they must ensure that the data is transferrable. In this sense, nurses also coordinate care when they capture and archive patient 
data. For example, when nurses enter data about their patients, they often consider the best way to record that data so that their 
colleagues can make sense of the information and, in turn, provide quality care. 
When coordinating care with their fellow team members, nurses often begin their shift by reviewing their patients’ history alone, 
but exchange information face-to-face with a nurse or nurses leaving their shift, though the analysis focuses on coordinating care 
C.B. Califf

through CareTech. When using CareTech to coordinate care, a nurse uses features involved in capturing and archiving patient data and 
accessing and reviewing patient data, such as radio buttons and checkboxes, and a computer mouse and keyboard. A nurse may use a 
text note feature of CareTech, called a nursing note, to type free-form notes to other care providers, though doing so is frowned upon by 
other nurses and hospital administrators. 
4.3.1. Challenge techno-stressor 
Many nurses appraised CareTech as aligning with their goals and values related to coordinating care. For example, a nurse who 
works in the child and adolescent psychiatric unit, the same nurse who appraised CareTech as misaligning with her goals and values 
related to charting, said that CareTech has helped nurses who practice psychiatric nursing make sense of subjective behavioral in­
formation through the structured design of the features affording the exchange of information. This is because, she said, the structured 
features of the system afford more objectivity and uniformity to a seemingly subjective assessment. This example also highlights that 
the same nurse who appraised and labeled some features of CareTech a hindrance techno-stressor, given other circumstances, 
appraised other features of CareTech as a challenge techno-stressor. 
Below, she explains that when CareTech was first implemented, she did not think it would not be a good fit for psychiatric nursing 
because “in psychiatric nursing … everything is more subjective.” Now, however, she prefers using the structured questions and 
guidelines embedded in CareTech to coordinate care and appraises them as conducive to her goal to pass on information. 
I had a hard time seeing how psychiatric nursing was going to be converted to a computer because everything is more sub­
jective. I think with [CareTech] came better guidelines for us. We’re all asking the same thing. It’s not just one nurse that’s very 
in-depth and another nurse that may not be. We all have specific things to check off and to watch for. It makes passing [in­
formation] onto the next shift a little bit more meaningful because they know what you’re talking about. – Nurse 9, Child and 
Adolescent Psychiatric Unit. 
Because nurses in her unit constantly monitor their patients for abnormal behavior, she says the features of CareTech help her and 
her fellow nurses record specific behaviors, such as the patient’s appearance and thoughts about suicide in an orderly fashion. 
We’re constantly watching people to make sure if they are at risk … We’re keeping them safe … You are marking off things [in 
CareTech] that are not normal, like, is their appearance normal? Yes or no? If not, how is it not within normal limits? We’re also 
monitoring for suicide. We ask them specific questions about suicide. Then we’re marking off how often they think about 
suicide… It’s just keeping keep order here and now. – Nurse 9, Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Unit. 
She compares this to how nurses in her unit previously exchanged information regarding abnormal patient behaviors before 
CareTech was implemented. In her unit, before CareTech, nurses coordinated care by documenting and exchanging more subjective 
and vague data about their patients. Now, CareTech provides her with detailed questions related to behaviors that nurses in her unit 
should acknowledge. 
Before [CareTech] you didn’t have certain boxes to mark off. You were just … “I think they did a great job.” [CareTech] gives us 
specific things to look at, specific things to be aware of … I think it’s encouraged teamwork and I think it’s improved the way we 
pass information on to each other. – Nurse 9, Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Unit. 
Overall, when reflecting on the change CareTech has brought to coordinating care in her unit, the nurse admits that while was 
initially cautious, the implementation of CareTech “has worked” in terms of enabling a better flow of information among nurses in her 
unit and beyond, thus aligning with her goal to record objective data about her patients and pass along uniform information, as well as 
her value to provide quality and safe care through collecting and passing accurate information. 
4.3.2. Hindrance techno-stressor 
Several nurses also discussed using CareTech in terms of coordinating care. Many mentioned that this affordance did not align with 
their care-related goals and values. For example, a charge nurse in the adult psychiatric unit, a unit similar to the child and adolescent 
psychiatric unit, describes how the structured features of CareTech do not enable her to coordinate care effectively. This is because, she 
says, CareTech was designed for nurses to communicate “high-level information” by using checkboxes or radio buttons to select a 
single option from multiple options associated with a pre-determined prompt. 
Sometimes I wish [CareTech] had more options for different things that we put down … It will have “Mood” and then it will 
have ten options you can select from. And you’re like, “Well, it doesn’t really fit any of these.” Sometimes that’s a problem 
because there are so many descriptive words for different things that we look at, specifically in Psych, and sometimes your 
patients don’t quite fit. - Nurse_27, Adult Psych Unit. 
She goes on to say that CareTech does have a feature to take a more narrative, free-from approach to documenting data by attaching 
a note in a patient’s file. Doing so enables care providers to type their interpretation of, for example, a patient’s mood that may not 
match one of the available options or to explain more about the context behind why a nurse chose that specific mood. However, the 
hospital she works for discourages her and other nurses from using the note feature. She explains that since it is frowned upon to use 
CareTech’s note feature and doing so may create more work for other nurses, she appraised the features related to coordinating care as 
“time-consuming” and “stressful.” Ultimately, she says, these choices and feelings take time away from making a personal connection 
with her patient, one of her core care-related values.

It’s really hard because if [your assessment] doesn’t fit in [CareTech’s options], you still want to get across your point, then 
you’re kind of conflicted on where to put it. Do you kind of make it fit into one of those [checkboxes] so that the nurse can see it? 
… How do you get that across to them? You always think “How is this going to look if they look back at it later?” “Is it con­
flicting?” “Are they going to take it the way I meant it?” It can be time-consuming, which can be stressful. - Nurse_27, Adult 
Psych Unit. 
Overall, she nurse appraised the structured nature of the features of CareTech related to coordinating care as misaligning with her 
goals and values. The standardization of the features was not relevant to her care-related goal to pass what she felt was accurate patient 
information to fellow care providers. Moreover, since she often felt like she was recording “conflicting” patient data and felt uneasy 
about getting her point across to other nurses, the features of CareTech that afford coordinating care, she thought, impacted the quality 
of care she was providing her patients. Plus, since recording information through these features also tended to take time away from 
direct patient interaction, using these features was not conducive to her value of building a personal relationship with her patients. 
5. Discussion 
The appraisal theory of technostress addresses how individuals evaluate and react to technology-related stressful events that urge 
action through implemented system features. I theorized that an individual appraises the system features involved in a technology- 
related stressful situation through an appraisal process that involves aligning or misaligning information about the situation and 
affordances related to the system features, conditioned by the environmental conditions, with the individual’s goals and values, and 
that such goal-value alignment shapes how an individual appraises, categorizes, and labels system features as challenge or hindrance 
techno-stressors. To instantiate these ideas empirically, the affordances associated with three common work practices were investi­
gated in a case study in the context of nursing. Table 2 summarizes the results of the case study in terms of the work practices and key 
affordances, as well as the environmental conditions, care-related goals and values, and the alignment or misalignment of the care- 
related goals and values in terms of goal relatedness, goal conduciveness, and value compatibility. 
The study highlights several notable findings. First, individuals appraise the same or similar system features differently. This is 
because the information on which appraisals are based comes from two main sources: (1) technology-related stressful situations/ 
events and (2) the action potential afforded by the system’s features. In this sense, how an individual appraises whether a technology- 
related stressor is a challenge techno-stressor or a hindrance techno-stressor depends on the contextual relationship among technology- 
related events urging action and the system features in use, as conditioned by the contextual environment. For example, two nurses in 
the case study who worked in psychiatric nursing, though different units, described using CareTech to coordinate care through the 
structured design of the features embedded in CareTech. Both nurses said that they were required to use the features of CareTech to 
capture and archive specific behavioral information about their patients, and underscored that doing so can be highly subjective. One 
nurse appraised coordinating care as associated with structured features that provide order to an already chaotic environment. The 
other nurse viewed the structured features associated with coordinating care as limiting her desire to provide a more personal 
assessment of her patient’s behavior. In this sense, both nurses had similar goals and values (to provide accurate information to 
colleagues; to provide quality and safe care), but under different environmental conditions, and different technology-related stressful 
events, appraised the same affordances and implemented system features differently. 
Second, how an individual evaluates if a technology-related stressor is a challenge or a hindrance is contingent on how an in­
dividual’s goals and values align with what the system features afford the user as related to acting on the technology-related event. For

example, two nurses who work in the same unit described using CareTech to administer and validate medications, which required 
them to be subject to the safety features implemented in CareTech. They both discussed the safety features in terms of affording a 
rigorous medication administration process that required several steps. The nurses, however, differed in terms of their goal-value 
alignment. For instance, one nurse explained that her care-related goal was to safely administer medications to her patients, which 
promoted her care-related values of safety and delivering quality care. She described a situation in which she nearly gave the wrong 
dose of medication to her patient, but the safety features of CareTech prevented her from doing so. Therefore, the affordance and 
associated safety protocols designed into the features of CareTech, as related to the event, were relevant and conducive to her goals and 
aligned with her values to provide quality and safe care to her patients. She, therefore, appraised the safety features and potential 
action offered by them as a challenge techno-stressor. Another nurse, however, discussed a situation involving a patient that was 
“dying of pain.” He appraised the safety features in terms of affording a medication administration process that, given his situation, 
was not related to his care-related goal to administer medications promptly, obstructed his immediate care-related goal, and was not 
compatible with his value to prevent his patient from suffering. He therefore appraised the affordance and implemented safety features 
of CareTech as a hindrance techno-stressor. 
Third, the appraisal process of technostress is ongoing and dynamic. In other words, appraisal in the context of technostress en­
compasses a continual (not static) process that involves repeated interaction with and action through system features and technology- 
related stressful events. For example, several nurses processed the information related to the technology-related stressor event by 
appraising how their immediate care-related goals and professional values, shaped by the environmental conditions, aligned with the 
potential actions needed to act on the event. One nurse for example was required to admit a patient that recently had a stroke. Her 
patient, accompanied by her exhausted husband, could not answer the questions she needed to archive in CareTech, and needed to rest. 
Under these conditions, the nurse’s immediate care-related goal was to admit her patient quickly and accurately, and her values were 
to prevent her patient from suffering and build a trusting relationship with her patient and her patient’s husband. When initially 
processing the event about using CareTech to admit her patient quickly and accurately, she seemed to appraise capturing and archiving 
data as a hindrance techno-stressor because, since her patient could not answer the abundance of questions required by CareTech due 
to the stroke, the affordance would require her to chart on an abundance of information related to admitting a patient, therefore 
misaligning with her goal to admit her patient quickly and accurately and her associated professional values. However, she then 
remembered that the situation was to readmit her patient. She reevaluated the event in terms of a new affordance: accessing and 
reviewing patient data. Fortunately, the patient’s data was already stored in CareTech. She then used the stored information to verify 
the information with the patient’s husband, a process that took much less time than admitting a new patient. In this sense, she began 
the appraisal process by viewing capturing and archiving patient data as misaligning with her goal and values, but reappraised the 
event as related to another affordance that she used in conjunction with the first affordance, which contributed to the alignment of 
goals and values associated acting on the event. This example reveals the dynamic nature of the appraisal process of technostress 
through affordances by highlighting repeated sense-making and appropriation experienced by the nurse as new information became 
available. 
Based on the above findings, I offer a conceptual process model to illustrate the appraisal theory of technostress, which is depicted 
in Fig. 2. The arrows in the figures denote sequential relationships, not causal dependencies. Fig. 2 is therefore a process model, not a 
variance model. The boxes represent the key dimensions at each stage of the model. 
The appraisal theory of technostress begins with a technology-related stressful situation/event that materializes from environ­
mental conditions in which an individual exists and interacts. The environmental conditions comprise three overarching systems: the 
social system, the psychological system, and the physical-technological system (McGrath, 1976). The overlap of the physical- 
technological system with the social and psychological system is where technology-related stressful demands/situations/events 
emerge. A technology-related stressful situation/event is a contextually driven stressful situation, demand, or event that requires the 
individual’s attention, and urges and/or requires the individual to act on the event by using the implemented system features 
embedded in a digital artifact. The implemented system features represent the current state of the material features of the artifact in use. 
The individual interprets and forms a relationship with the implemented system features through action possibilities called affordances. 
These affordances are shaped and reshaped by repeated interactions with the implemented system features involving the user’s

perception of the features, the user’s abilities, and the user’s action-oriented goals and values. 
Before actualizing an affordance, the individual must process the information related to the stressful event by evaluating whether 
the implemented system features and action possibilities are conducive to acting on the technology-related situation/event in terms of 
their goals and values. This occurs through an appraisal process. In the appraisal process, the individual processes information about the 
event, and uses that information to evaluate whether the implemented system features offer action possibilities related to acting on the 
event. To appraise this information, the user experiences three appraisal checks involving how the individual makes sense of the event 
in terms of the action possibilities afforded by the system features as related to the user’s action-oriented goals and values. These 
appraisal checks include artifact-related goal relevance, artifact-related goal conduciveness, and artifact-related value compatibility. 
Artifact-related goal relevance is defined as whether the implemented system features offer action possibilities and associated fea­
tures relevant to the user’s immediate goals. A strong artifact-related goal relevance indicates that the individual considers the action 
possibilities offered by the implemented system features highly relevant to carrying out one’s immediate goals, while a weak artifact- 
related goal relevance indicates that the individual does not consider the action possibilities offered by the implemented system 
features relevant to carrying out one’s immediate goals. Artifact-related goal conduciveness is determined by the user when the 
encountered action possibilities afforded by the implemented system features are compared to the user’s desired action possibilities. In 
this sense, the implemented system features could afford action possibilities relevant to achieving one’s immediate goals (i.e., the 
features have high goal relevance) but could not be the most desirable system features for acting on the event. Strong artifact-related 
goal conduciveness occurs when the user encounters system features that are desirable and preferred in terms of meeting their current 
goals, while weak artifact-related goal conduciveness occurs when the user encounters system features that are not desirable and not 
preferred to meeting their current goals. The user could interpret the affordance and associated features as relevant to achieving one’s 
goals and carrying out an action, but not as conducive to achieving one’s goals and carrying out an action. Artifact-related value 
compatibility arises when the action possibilities and actions afforded by the implemented system features are highly compatible with 
the user’s values, which could be both internal values and external values. If the implemented system features enable the user’s ability 
to actualize an affordance that is consistent with the user’s values, the user experiences strong value compatibility. If the implemented 
system features enable the user’s ability to actualize an affordance and that action is inconsistent with the user’s values, the user 
experiences weak value compatibility. 
The evaluative product of the appraisal process, or the appraisal, represents how the user categorizes and labels the affordances and 
associated features. These categories and “fuzzy” labels (Scherer, 2010) crystalize through repeated system use. The individual tends to 
label the affordance and its associated features as a challenge techno-stressor if the affordance, as related to the event, promotes task 
accomplishment, which is defined as having strong goal relevance, goal conduciveness, and value compatibility over time. The in­
dividual tends to label the affordance and its associated features a hindrance techno-stressor if the affordance, as related to the event, 
tends to obstruct task accomplishment, which is defined as having weak goal relevance, goal conduciveness, and value compatibility 
over time. This overall process is shaped by the contextual work environment and stressful situations/events shaping the appraisal 
checks. The appraisal tendencies occur through a process of sense-making and appropriation (Cheikh-Ammar, 2018). This means that, 
over time, and through repeated interactions with the artifact, and recurring sense-making and appropriation, the recurrent 
technology-related stressful events and their associated action possibilities and related features become patterned and thus appro­
priated as appraisal tendencies categorized and labeled as a challenge or hindrance techno-stressor. 
As previous research shows, the appraisal of a technology-related stressful situation/event influences an individual’s psychological 
response and individual and workplace outcomes (Califf et al., 2020). The psychological response, which is indicated by positive or 
negative emotions, tends to be directly related to how an individual appraises an event; individual and organizational outcomes, in 
turn, tend to be directly related to the psychological responses (Hargrove et al., 2013). For example, in the context of healthcare, if a 
nurse repeatedly appraises an EMR system’s features as associated with events and affordances that misalign with their goals and 
values, and they consider the EMR system’s features and the system as a whole as repeatedly obstructing task accomplishment (i.e., as a 
hindrance techno-stressor), they likely tend to regularly experience negative emotional states, such as burnout, associated with using 
the EMR system. Negative emotional states like burnout tend to be linked to negative individual outcomes, such as low job satisfaction 
or high turnover intention, as well as negative organizational outcomes like high turnover (Califf et al., 2020). In this sense, repeated 
appraisal of an EMR system and its associated features as a hindrance techno-stressor has the potential to manifest itself as burnout, 
resulting in high turnover, which, in the context of healthcare, has been shown to lower the quality of patient care (Espezel & Canam, 
2003). Conversely, repeated appraisal of an EMR system and its associated features as a challenge techno-stressor can provide in­
dividuals with meaningfulness and purpose in their work and can lead to perceptions of control over their work, leading to more 
positive individual and organizational outcomes likely to contribute to better quality patient care (Hargrove et al., 2013). Overall, 
understanding how an individual appraises system features more positively (as a challenge) or more negatively (as a hindrance) is a 
crucial step towards reinforcing positive mental health among individuals, ensuring that individuals find purpose in their work, un­
derstanding how positive and negative workplace outcomes may occur, and identifying ways to potentially mitigate negative out­
comes while maintaining and reinforcing positive ones. 
The appraisal theory of technostress does not represent a complete theory of affordances and does not empirically address the 
holistic process of technostress. Instead, it offers a mid-range theory (Anderson & Robey, 2017). The focus of the appraisal theory of 
technostress is on the appraisal component of the holistic technostress process (Califf et al., 2020). In doing so, it offers a deeper 
understanding of how an individual evaluates and appraises neutral technology-related stressful events and system features as a 
challenge or hindrance. For example, the appraisal theory of technostress conceptualizes system features as being shaped by their 
action possibilities as related to an individual’s goals and values; however, it does not investigate the role of perception and abilities 
which are central concepts in the literature on affordances (Gaver, 1991, 1996; Gibson, 1979; Norman, 1988, 1999; Strong et al., 
C.B. Califf

2014). Likewise, the appraisal theory of technostress does not directly address affordances in terms of actualization (Strong et al., 
2014). It represents a step towards actualization, and therefore represents a key part of how and why individuals may actualize an 
affordance, and more specifically, how individuals may feel about actualizing affordances that align/misalign with their goals and 
values. Last, the appraisal theory of technostress does not offer direct insight into concepts central to the holistic process of technostress 
such as the psychological response or outcomes, or any of the two other evaluative processes involved in technostress (e.g., the decision 
process and performance process). 
6. Contributions for research 
In this paper, affordances were used as the lens to depict how the individual relates to the features of a material artifact in terms of 
action possibilities (Anderson & Robey, 2017; Strong et al., 2014). Theorizing and investigating technostress in this way departs from 
much of the literature on technostress, which tends to frame technostress as comprised of causal relationships between fixed constructs 
(Califf et al., 2020; Ragu-Nathan et al., 2008; Tarafdar et al., 2007). Instead of focusing on these structural and causal relationships, the 
appraisal theory of technostress offers a non-deterministic, dynamic, and relational view of technostress that is shaped by context 
(Fayard & Weeks, 2007). Affordances in this study therefore facilitated the recognition of the value of individual agency in forming 
relationships with, and appraisals of, action possibilities shaped by the individual’s situationally driven goals and values (Cheikh- 
Ammar, 2018; Strong et al., 2014). Moreover, much of the literature on technostress regards technology as a stable object comprised of 
stable properties and stable perceptions (Ragu-Nathan et al., 2008). However, in this study, the technology component in the appraisal 
theory of technostress was not reduced to invariant system features, and the stress component in the appraisal theory of technostress was 
not reduced to invariant perceptions. The appraisal theory of technostress is therefore a part of a holistic process that centers on a 
situationally and contextually dependent relationship the individual develops with an artifact in use. 
Affordances were connected to the literature on technostress through concepts central to appraisal theory (Lazarus, 2001; Scherer, 
2010). For example, several appraisal theories underscore the importance of goals and values when evaluating objects or events 
concerning action and offer insight into how individuals appraise objects or events through appraisal checks such as goal relevance, 
goal conduciveness, and value compatibility (Lazarus, 1992, 2001; Scherer, 2010). Likewise, the literature on affordances argues that 
the individual relates to a digital artifact through relational action possibilities that are shaped by action-oriented goals and values 
(Cheikh-Ammar, 2018; Strong et al., 2014). However, most appraisal theories do not discuss mechanisms involved in appraising and 
processing information about a digital artifact in terms of its features and relational action possibilities. This study combined these 
concepts central to these two literature streams to help make sense of how the individual relates to their material environment and 
processes information afforded by their environment through goal relevance, goal conduciveness, and value compatibility. In doing, 
affordances were extended to the stress, technostress, and appraisal literature. 
The present study also builds on the work of Barley, Meyerson, and Grodal (2011), Salo, Pirkkalainen, and Koskelainen (2019), and 
Benlian (2020) to methodologically study technostress using a qualitative approach. In the past, IS research has typically employed a 
“variable-based” approach to investigate technostress (Riedl, Kindermann, Auinger, & Javor, 2012). Doing so may limit the under­
standing of the relational dynamics that comprise the essence and “richness” of the stress process (Cooper et al., 2001; Lazarus, 2006; 
McGrath, 1976). This paper now adds to the growing number of IS papers to use qualitative approaches to investigate technostress (e. 
g., Benlian, 2020; Salo et al., 2019). Using qualitative approaches to study stress has been advocated for by stress researchers for 
decades. For example, Cooper et al. (2001) encouraged scholars to “consider methods that capture the richness of the [stress] process 
and the ideographic nature of the experience” (p. 219). The current study applies a qualitative approach to obtain a richer insight into 
technostress by studying the ideographic experiences of the individual and capturing the contextual complexities and relational dy­
namics that are prevalent in technostress, especially in a non-traditional environmental setting: a hospital. Specifically, the analysis 
centered on identifying the ideographic nature of the experience of individual nurses using an EMR system under different conditions. 
Doing so enabled the interpretation of the dynamic interplay between the nurse and the EMR system in the context of technostress, and 
provided several contextual insights into a system-in-use (Hong, Chan, Thong, Chasalow, & Dhillon, 2013). 
This paper also extends the literature on technostress by expanding on the definitions of challenge techno-stressors and hindrance 
techno-stressors. Previous research on challenge and hindrance stressors, and challenge and hindrance techno-stressors, which em­
ploys these concepts to study stress and technostress, do not include much information about the mechanisms underlying these 
concepts (Tarafdar et al., 2019). For example, Califf et al. (2020) define challenge and hindrance techno-stressors in terms of pro­
moting or obstructing task accomplishment, but do not reveal much about what promoting or obstructing task accomplishment means. 
The present study shines a light on how IS researchers may conceptualize the individual’s interpretation of a material artifact in terms 
of promoting or obstructing task accomplishment through how potential actions align (or misalign) with an individual’s goals and 
values through goal relatedness, goal conduciveness, and value compatibility (Scherer, 2010). IS researchers can therefore use these 
three dimensions to characterize the mechanisms involved in how individuals appraise challenge and hindrance techno-stressors. 
7. Contributions for practice 
The analysis uncovered several contextually dependent insights for managers and healthcare administrators to consider. For 
example, the analysis revealed that using EMR systems to carry out care-related tasks both supported and conflicted with nurses’ care- 
related values. Healthcare administrators should therefore consider working directly with care providers including nurses to under­
stand how EMR systems can enable them to carry out tasks that support and align with their care-related values and care-related goals, 
thereby contributing to more positive emotions related to eustress. As Hargrove et al. (2013) state about nurses: “nurses, for example, 
C.B. Califf                                                                                                                                                                                                               
Information and Organization 32 (2022) 100431
18
who have very demanding jobs, report eustress as indicated by hope and active engagement in their work, which contribute to feelings 
of well-being. Among nurses dealing with the death of patients, those who found meaning in work and were highly engaged still 
experienced eustress and its benefits” (p. 62). In this sense, I argue that EMR systems, when offering system features that align with a 
nurse’s goals and values, have the potential to induce feelings associated with eustress, and thereby contribute to feelings of well-being 
and engagement in work. 
However, when EMR systems do not offer features that align with a nurse’s goals and values, EMR systems could induce feelings 
associated with concepts such as moral distress (Corley, 1995; Epstein & Delgado, 2010; Jameton, 1993; Wiegand & Funk, 2012) and 
dehumanization and depersonalization of patients (Barnard & Sandelowski, 2001). Moral distress, for example, occurs when in­
dividuals “act in a manner contrary to personal and professional values, which undermines integrity and authenticity” (ACCN, 2008). 
Several nurses in the analysis provided examples of using CareTech to carry out care-related goals that conflict with their care-related 
values. In this sense, using EMR systems may afford feelings associated with moral distress, which has been linked to burnout and 
turnover (Espezel & Canam, 2003). Many nurses also discussed relationships with CareTech that exhibited undertones of “dehu­
manization, depersonalization, and objectification of patients and of nursing care” (Barnard & Sandelowski, 2001). For example, 
several nurses mentioned that the documentation structure of the pre-determined question sets designed in CareTech was associated 
with exchanging patient data that lacked context. In this sense, when EMR systems are designed to afford the exchange of structured, 
objective data without context they have the potential to “deprive patients of their individuality, subjectivity, and dignity as human 
beings” and “separate nurses from their mission to care” (Barnard & Sandelowski, 2001, p. 367). 
8. Limitations & future research 
The study illustrates and empirically investigates an appraisal theory of technostress. Still, there are limitations to the study. First, 
nurses’ reflections on situations and stressful feelings may suffer from biases and limited recall of memory. However, nurses were often 
interviewed directly, or a few days after their shift, which likely mitigated the concerns surrounding recall. Second, nursing is often 
considered stressful career. During interviews, nurses may have been mentally tense especially after coming off a shift. This could have 
resulted in an exaggeration of stressful situations. Third, the paper studied the usage of technology in the context of required action (i. 
e., nurses were required to use CareTech to carry out tasks). Future research should consider exploring the relationship between 
appraisal and affordances in the context of voluntary usage. Fourth, the study did not address the entire holistic process of technostress. 
The influence of appraisal on emotions, and nursing-related outcomes has not been empirically researched in this study. Future 
research should consider examining the interaction across all the components in the holistic technostress process from the perspective 
of the individual, which would provide more depth to the dynamic nature of technostress. Last, it should be noted that goal relevance, 
goal conduciveness, and value compatibility are by no means the only mechanisms individuals use to process information afforded by 
their environment. Scherer (2010) component process model has several other appraisal checks related to information processing. 
Future research should consider several of these mechanisms and how they impact appraisal. 
9. Conclusion 
The study offers a novel theoretical perspective and methodological approach to conceptualizing and investigating technostress by 
using stress, technostress, affordances, and appraisal literature to theorize an appraisal theory of technostress and use a case study to 
present a process model that illustrates the appraisal theory of technostress. IS researchers can use this theory and methodological 
approach to take a contextualized, meaning-centric approach to study technostress as related to action. Overall, I hope that this paper 
inspires IS researchers to consider framing and investigating technostress in terms of a contextually dependent relational process that 
hinges on the ideographic experiences of the individual undergoing technostress.

Appendix 2: sample interview questions* 
*These were the suggested interview questions related to stress, and were followed depending on the nature of the interview.  
1. I’d like to start by getting an idea of what sort of role you play in your organization.  
a. What is the nature of your role?  
i. Within your organization?  
ii. Do you have a clear idea of what is expected of you in your job?  
2. How does the nature of your job impact your life outside of work, if at all?  
a. What makes you say that?  
3. Just describe a typical work day for you. What happens at work?  
a. Now take us through a day where you experienced high levels of stress. What components of your job (or other events) added to 
your stress?  
b. How well prepared are you to manage the level of stress you experience? What makes you say that?  
4. What kind of organizational support is provided to you to deal with the following:  
a. Stress  
b. Promotion/training  
c. Job improvements  
5. Let’s talk a little bit about the role of technology in your work.  
a. What kinds of technology do you use in your work? How would you describe that technology (support your work, interfere with 
your work, make things easier/harder, etc.)?  
i. What aspect(s), if any, of each do you find useful? Can you elaborate?  
ii. What aspect(s), if any, do you find stressful? Can you elaborate?  
b. Describe the education/training you receive(d) when new technologies are introduced into your work. How would you describe 
that education/training (adequate, insufficient, etc.)  
c. What types of technology support is provided to you. For example, are you given mobile devices?  
d. What aspects of the mobile devices do you find useful? What components do your feel is more of a hindrance?  
6. How do you feel about your future in your job given constraints/concerns you have about managing stress?  
a. Why do you feel that way?  
b. How long do you anticipate you will retain this position?  
i. Why do you feel that way?  
c. How are you dealing with those concerns?  
7. What recommendations would you make to organizations/managers for improving the stress-level of employees?

Sustainability studies in healthcare systems predominantly have a goods-dominant outlook and focus on the 
environmental sustainability of hospitals in developed nations. When faced with poor availability and afford­
ability (reduced ease of access), healthcare systems must pay attention to social sustainability. As in the rest of the 
world, the burden of chronic non-communicable diseases requiring long-term and high patient involvement is 
increasing in India. ‘Information exchange’ (integrating knowledge) is a crucial co-creation process. Besides 
‘information exchange,’ this study considers ‘interaction quality’ (reciprocal understanding) and the customers’ 
‘knowledge development attitude’ as value-creating processes. The Stimulus-Organism-Response (S-O-R) 
framework suggests that these cues prompt patients to participate and contribute to healthcare outcomes, resulting 
in their continued patronage and reduced ease of access weakens this positive influence. Data was collected from 
General Practitioners (GP) who treat diabetic patients in Jharkhand (with limited healthcare resources and a low- 
average per-person income). A pilot sample data ensured the reliability of the instrument before the large-scale 
survey calibrated and independently validated a structural equation model. It was determined that the positive 
influence of ‘information exchange’ and ‘knowledge development attitude’ (‘interaction quality’) on patients’ 
contribution to healthcare outcomes is (is not) weaker in reduced ease of access. The patients perceive a degree 
of risk owing to their limited understanding of the healthcare components (e.g., medication). Stated processes 
reduce this and add to the system’s value (knowledge to cure and learn as per service-dominant logic) and 
improve trust in the service provider. With reduced ease of access, the time spent with the patient has to be 
effectively used to allay fears and gain trust empathetically. GP clinics with reduced hierarchy and protocols are 
better suited for required policy changes and service innovations. This is the first study to apply the S-O-R 
framework interlaced with service-dominant logic in sustainable healthcare.   
1. Introduction 
Sustainable development is founded on the three pillars of sustain­
ability: social, economic, and environmental. Sustainable practices lead 
to the long-term profitability of organizations while positively affecting 
society. A health service that can mobilize resources (staffing, technol­
ogy, information, and finance) and use them efficiently is considered 
economically sustainable. If it can meet individual health needs and 
ensure accessibility for all citizens, it is considered socially sustainable 
(Olsen, 1998). The social aspect is the main characteristic of the service 
sector (Hussain et al., 2018). The healthcare system must focus on pa­
tient outcomes (e.g., degree of recovery, time to recovery, emotional 
well-being) and improve access. 
Access to health service is defined as the ease with which those 
requiring care can use it in proportion to their needs. A few contextual 
factors which impact access are government health policy and budget 
allocation for health. Those directly impacting access are patient 
mobility (age, handicap), availability of time and money, occupational 
flexibility, and transport availability (Olsen, 1998; Levesque et al., 
2013). Sustainability requires the healthcare system to adapt to eco­
nomic and socio-demographic changes (Aquino et al., 2018), which 
impact access to health services (e.g., availability & affordability). 
Besides being the most expensive resource, hospitals are the largest 
emitters in the healthcare system (Duindam, 2022). Individual hospitals 
are merging to exploit economies of scale and offer broader services 
(Deloitte, 2016) despite evidence that it may not be more cost-effective 
or provide better patient outcomes (Ahgren, 2008; Azevedo and Mateus, 
2014). When faced with poor availability and affordability, healthcare

systems must pay attention to social sustainability, which generally re­
ceives less attention than environmental sustainability (Eizenberg and 
Jabareen, 2017). Thus, like other industries, healthcare organizations 
must reinvent their business model and services. Studies suggest that 
General Practitioners (GP) clinics contribute much less than hospitals to 
healthcare emissions (Malik et al., 2018), and their smaller size may 
improve response to demand and patient outcomes (Pantzartzis et al., 
2017). 
1.1. Research motivation 
The per capita income in Jharkhand state at the current price (the 
average per-person income) was 50% of the all-India average (Rs. 1.72 
Lakhs) in 2022–23 (RBI, 2022). Nearly one-third of the state is forest 
land (amongst the highest in India), and three-fourths of the population 
lives in rural areas. WHO recommends a doctor-patient ratio of 1:1000, 
and the state with a three-crore population has a significant shortage 
(more so than others) of GP, specialist doctors, and nurses in public 
healthcare facilities (NHS, 2021). It is estimated that three-fourths of 
Indian urban and rural households seek services from private healthcare 
facilities and rely on GP clinics for outpatient treatment (NFHS, 2021). 
In India, the burden of non-communicable diseases is increasing. 
Chronic non-communicable diseases (cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, 
cancers, and chronic respiratory diseases) account for two-thirds of 
deaths worldwide (WHO, 2014). Unlike most communicable diseases, 
which require only discrete interactions, their management requires a 
long-term and high patient involvement in the service delivery process 
to help the healthcare professional determine vital decisions and provide 
the desired value. 
As per service-centered logic, tangible goods are but transmitters of 
the organization’s skills, knowledge, and process, and the organization’s 
focus should be on providing customers ‘value-in-use’ of tangible goods. 
In healthcare, medication, surgery, and preventive care (the compo­
nents) are not the actual system’s value (which is the skill and knowl­
edge to cure, share, and learn) nor the value the customer desires (which 
is good health, and a sense of well-being at low cost). The patient co- 
creates the value in relational exchanges. Giving the patient access to 
knowledge and skills and improving his ability to use them enhances 
his/her co-creation ability (Vargo and Lusch, 2004b). Due to their 
complex needs, chronic patients are more likely to make an effort to 
co-create than those with acute illness (Fusco et al., 2023). 
Sustainability in healthcare involves balancing the patient’s needs 
and the organization’s economic concerns (Jameton and McGuire, 
2002). The healthcare organization aims to create the desired value for 
the patient with minimal resources (e.g., material, energy, staff time) 
consumption. Identifying areas of interventions to balance these con­
flicting requirements to improve sustainability is essential. The number 
of patients needing service and the time spent with each patient by the 
doctor significantly affect the quality & cost of healthcare (Bhat, 1999). 
Poor access for the patient in terms of (1) length of waiting time for 
service, (2) distance/time to reach a facility, and (3) financial con­
straints have implications for sustainability. As per the value co-creation 
view, value is created for all the stakeholders involved (not only the 
organization) and the whole ecosystem in which the organization 
operates, thus sustaining social development and sustainability (Saviano 
et al., 2017). 
1.2. Research objective and approach 
The study objective is to determine value co-creation as the pathway 
for health systems to balance social and economic sustainability, eval­
uate the effectiveness of co-creation processes in the context of reduced 
ease of access, and to provide insights on GP clinics’ advantages over 
hospitals in achieving these goals. The organizational capacity repre­
sents the capability to carry out co-creation processes. The interaction 
between the customer and the contact personnel is part of co-creation in 
the joint sphere. For example, information exchange adds to the customer 
and contact personnel resources, and interaction quality improves mutual 
resource utilization through reciprocal understanding. The customer 
also creates value independent of the organization and its processes in 
his/her sphere. For example, as a result of knowledge development atti­
tude, which adds to his/her resources (Fusco et al., 2023). 
Adopting the S-O-R framework, it is argued that customers’ 
continued relationship with the service provider is caused by stimuli 
that prompt customers’ internal assessment and ultimately determine 
their intention to continue patronage of the service organization. We 
develop a conceptual model comprising three significant factors:  
• Value co-creation processes (information exchange, interaction 
quality, and knowledge development attitude),  
• Co-creation measure (the empowered patient’s contribution to 
healthcare outcomes through decision participation and control over 
his/her healthcare outcome), and  
• Consequences of co-creation (continued patronage). 
The factors based on Stimulus-Organism-Response (S-O-R) theory 
(Mehrabian and Russell, 1974) are associated with one another, and it 
describes the significance of the patient’s contribution to healthcare 
outcomes. 
S-O-R is a theoretical framework. However, the theoretical frame­
work must be specified, and its constructs measured and empirically 
tested to support its practical utility. Constructs were measured using 
well-supported measures from health services and value co-creation 
literature. The questionnaire was self-administered to doctors in GP 
clinics who treat diabetic patients. A pilot sample purified the mea­
surement scale and ensured the reliability of the instrument before the 
large-scale survey. Survey data was used to calibrate and validate a 
structural equation model independently. 
In this context, the research questions are: 
RQ1: Does the effect of value-creating processes vary on the cus­
tomer’s contribution to service outcomes according to the strength of 
service access? More specifically, how do value-creating processes 
affect patients’ contribution to healthcare outcomes according to the 
strength of access to health services? 
RQ2: How does a customer’s contribution to service outcomes affect 
their intention to continue patronage of the service organization? 
More specifically, how does a patient’s contribution to healthcare 
outcomes affect their intention to continue patronage of the health 
service organization? 
1.3. Research contributions 
A Doctor spends time with each patient to examine him/her and 
communicate and exchange relevant information. It significantly affects 
the cost and quality of healthcare (Bhat, 1999). The contributions of this 
study are as follows: 
1. ‘Information exchange’ is a crucial co-creation process. Besides ‘in­
formation exchange,’ this study considers ‘interaction quality’ and 
the customers’ ‘knowledge development attitude’ as value-creating 
processes.  
2. The positive influence of ‘information exchange’ and ‘knowledge 
development attitude’ (‘interaction quality’) on patients’ contribu­
tion to healthcare outcomes is (is not) weaker in reduced ease of 
access. Interaction quality is critical in clarifying the patient’s role in 
contributing to healthcare outcomes, setting service expectations, 
and empathetically allaying fears and gaining trust, especially with 
reduced ease of access. 
3. Unlike hospitals, GP clinics (with reduced department barriers, hi­
erarchy, and protocols) have the advantage of being close to the 
patients enabling them to identify the desired patient outcomes, 
R. Mathialagan and T.S. Kuthambalayan

decide on new services (e.g., telemedicine) to improve availability and 
price the service appropriately to improve affordability. 
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 pro­
vides the related literature and positions our work in the literature. 
Section 3 offers theoretical background from service and co-creation 
literature. Section 4 presents the research model and hypotheses. Sec­
tion 5 describes the methods. Section 6 provides the results. Section 7 
discusses the findings. Section 8 concludes with recommendations for 
future research. 
2. Literature review 
2.1. Sustainable healthcare 
Hospitals are the largest emitters in the healthcare system. This has 
led most studies to focus on them (e.g., Rodriguez et al., 2020; Kumar 
and Chaudhary, 2021). Hospital operations use disinfectants, bleach, 
and detergents. They add to carbon emissions in energy use, travel (e.g., 
for staff), and procurement (e.g., equipment) (Pencheon, 2009). They 
also consume water, oil, and minerals and produce waste (McGain and 
Naylor, 2014). Rattan et al. (2022) propose sustainability indicators for 
public healthcare, and Rodriguez et al. (2020) report on sustainability 
practices in public hospitals. 
The literature on sustainability has focused more on the environ­
mental impacts of the manufacturing sector in developed Western 
countries (Hussain et al., 2016) and evaluated the focal firm and its 
supplier(s). E.g., Van Boerdonk et al. (2021) studied value creation in a 
circular economy for hospitals by medical suppliers from the customers’ 
perspective. We adopt the Service-Dominant logic and study a focal firm 
and its customer(s). 
Sustainability studies on health clinics are scanty, particularly those 
with a focus on India is rare. In India, for instance, access to health 
services is hampered by relatively poor infrastructure, information 
technology development, innovation, and implementation of govern­
ment policies (Rogers et al., 2016). The sustainable healthcare processes 
to improve social & economic sustainability and their effectiveness will 
likely differ in the context of reduced access. 
Punnakitikashem and Hallinger (2019) review the literature on 
sustainability management in the healthcare sector and categorize them 
into three streams. The first stream highlights the importance of an or­
ganization’s vision, leadership, culture, and capacity to adapt. The 
second stream focuses on innovations in healthcare operations. The 
third stream focuses on health policy and resource mobilization. Sus­
tainable value co-creation allows health services to be close to the pa­
tients, adapt to their needs, and innovate. As healthcare is a 
knowledge-intensive industry, developing intellectual capital is 
required for sustainable development (Cavicchi and Vagnoni, 2017). 
The co-creating value processes identified by us should help in this 
direction. 
2.2. Stimulus-organism-response (S-O-R) theory 
The S-O-R framework is used to describe the relationship among the 
stimulus (informational cues) experienced, the internal assessment 
(cognitive and affective reactions) produced, and the organism’s sub­
sequent response (behavioral intentions). Examples of the stimulus are 
social presence and website quality, the organism is positive emotional 
responses and attitude towards shopping, and the responses are pur­
chase intention and impulse buying behavior (Ürgüplü and Yumurtacı 
Hüseyino˘
glu, 2021). In Omni-channel retailing, the S-O-R framework 
considers customer empowerment (providing them with more options 
and detailed information on each) as the organism. It provides insights 
into stimuli such as customer perceptions of channel integration and 
convenience (Pereira et al., 2023). 
The S-O-R framework has also improved our understanding of green 
consumers’ purchase intention (response variable). Examples of infor­
mational cues (stimuli) used are the consumer’s environmental attitude 
(Piligrimien˙
e et al., 2020) and the informational content embodied in 
the product and website (Ahmad and Zhang, 2020). Among the factors 
considered in an organism’s internal assessment is the consumer’s 
cognitive/emotional/behavioral engagement (Piligrimien˙
e et al., 2020). 
Most of the past application of the S-O-R framework is in retail. These 
studies have a goods-dominant outlook. The experiential consumer 
research stream focuses not on offerings but on the experience of its 
consumption. In our study, this is the empowering experience resulting 
from decision-making during the service encounter. If the customer’s 
experiences meet his/her expectations, it shall lead to his/her continued 
patronage (Payne et al., 2008). 
The literature on applying service-dominant logic to health services 
is scanty (Joiner and Lusch, 2016). The issue of information asymmetry 
(which is more prevalent in service industries) and its impact on value 
co-creation outcomes is yet to receive adequate attention in the litera­
ture (Barile et al., 2014). The value-creating processes to empower 
customers shall differ from the service-dominant viewpoint, and their 
effectiveness shall depend on the study characteristics. This is the first 
study to apply the S-O-R framework interlaced with service-dominant 
logic in sustainable healthcare. 
3. Theoretical background 
In health services, value co-creation aims to obtain mutual benefit by 
promoting decision participation and patient control, thereby ensuring 
improved experience and relationship with the healthcare professional 
and continued patronage of the organization. 
3.1. Information exchange (IE) 
Information exchange is integrating skills and knowledge between 
the contact personnel and the customers to enhance them through 
interaction and dialog. It indicates that the contact personnel not only 
answers the customer’s questions but also encourages further queries. 
Information sharing leads the healthcare professional and the patient to 
make treatment-related decisions to achieve the desired health outcome 
at a low cost. The integration of resources and learning leads to mutual 
benefit. The organization’s role is to provide experiential interactions 
and encounters and, thereby, improve its competitiveness by enhancing 
the customer’s resources in terms of knowledge and skills (Payne et al., 
2008). 
3.2. Interaction quality (IQ) 
The organization must shift its marketing communications focus 
from attention-seeking to dialog with customers to support their expe­
riences and learning processes. Managing chronic illness requires 
frequent interaction with the healthcare professional, and the illness 
cannot be managed in a single meeting. Interaction quality results from 
the contact personnel providing advice and relevant information that 
the patient can comprehend (Camacho et al., 2014). It is a contact 
personnel value-creating process, resources, and practices. The organi­
zation can improve its competitiveness by influencing the customer’s 
process so that the customer can utilize available resources more effi­
ciently and effectively (Payne et al., 2008). 
3.3. Knowledge development attitude (KDA) 
Knowledge development attitude requires that patients actively 
collect their illness and treatment-related information from published 
sources, both online and offline (Prigge et al., 2015), and systematically 
analyze and understand the information. It is recommended that 
chronically ill patients develop some degree of disease-related expertise 
to manage their illness daily. It is a patient’s value-creating process, 
R. Mathialagan and T.S. Kuthambalayan                                                                                                                                                                                                 
Journal of Cleaner Production 422 (2023) 138545
4
resources, and practices and indicates the degree to which patients are 
ready to fulfill their role in resource integration. The value can be 
enhanced through positive interventions for further development 
(Payne et al., 2008). 
3.4. Contribution to healthcare outcomes (CHO) 
Patients increasingly take an active role in healthcare service de­
livery, empowering them. As empowerment increases, participants 
become more involved in decision-making, managing, and controlling 
resources (Fusco et al., 2023). It represents a more collaborative rela­
tionship and diverges from the paternalistic approach in which the pa­
tient passively complies with the healthcare professional’s advice. Since 
only the patient experiences the illness and the service experience, 
his/her perspective, response to, and ability to comply with the 
healthcare professional’s advice is essential in value co-creation through 
shared decision-making (Anderson et al., 2018). 
3.5. Continued patronage (CP) 
Service-dominant logic is a customer-centric approach requiring the 
management of cross-functional business processes to build relation­
ships with customers who participate in acquiring customized service 
solutions efficiently (Vargo and Lusch, 2004a). The practice of medicine 
requires a healthy healthcare professional-patient relationship to be 
sustained in the long term for chronic illness. A good relationship with 
his/her healthcare professional makes the patient more likely to be 
satisfied with the treatment outcome and adhere to it. It also indicates 
that the patient trusts the healthcare professional, has confidence in his 
ability to treat him/her, and continuously relies on him/her for advice. 
Trust is a crucial aspect of any relationship but vital in health care and is 
a primary factor in patient choice as against a rational risk-benefit 
analysis (Barile et al., 2014). The relationship length is significant as 
the total value is co-created over time as the relationship develops 
(Payne et al., 2008). 
3.6. Reduced ease of access (REoA) 
Availability of health services with sufficient capacity, their 
geographical density and concentration refer to health professionals 
being reached physically and on time. Access is hampered in case of 
limited transportation availability, and the patient’s restricted mobility 
(e.g., aged, handicapped) and lack of occupational flexibility (e.g., 
inability to remain absent from work). Affordability reflects the capacity 
of patients to spend resources (e.g., money, time) to use health services. 
It results from direct prices of health services and opportunity costs 
related to income loss (e.g., absence from work). The resource require­
ment shall vary by type of illness (Levesque et al., 2013). 
4. Hypothesis development 
The S-O-R model suggests that reduced ease of access (REoA) nega­
tively impacts the positive influence of information exchange (IE), 
interaction quality (IQ), and knowledge development attitude (KDA) on 
Fig. 1. Theoretical framework for patient’s contribution to healthcare outcomes.  
R. Mathialagan and T.S. Kuthambalayan

the patient’s contribution to healthcare outcomes (CHO), and his/her 
continued patronage (CP). The following section discusses the theoret­
ical relationship (depicted in Fig. 1), providing reasons. 
4.1. Information exchange and contribution to healthcare outcomes 
Information exchange shall inform the patient of the chronic illness 
and the pros and cons of different value propositions, being attracted, 
and engaging in new types of behavior regarding how the value prop­
osition relates to their life. The doctor, who is also responsible for 
marketing the firm’s services, shall improve the patients’ understanding 
of healthcare resources and available benefits and reduce their 
perceived risk. Patients are informed of their role during the treatment 
and the benefits of performing tasks. A dialog that enhances mutual 
knowledge and leads to an appreciation of experiences, opinions, and 
emotions can sustainably co-create value (Fusco et al., 2023). It moti­
vates the patients, fosters their decision participation, and positively 
impacts their behavior in value co-creation. Empowered interaction 
with patients encourages them to express opinions. It makes them feel 
more in control of the service transaction process, causing them to 
involve actively in the co-creation of service, impacting perceived value 
(Hau et al., 2017). 
We propose the following hypothesis based on our previous 
discussion: 
H1.
Information exchange is positively related to contribution to 
healthcare outcomes 
4.2. Interaction quality and contribution to healthcare outcomes 
Interaction quality is the effectiveness of information exchanged to 
understand the patient’s behavior and health-related issues by health­
care personnel. In chronic illness, frequent healthcare professional- 
patient interaction is required, and healthcare professionals as contact 
personnel are part of the process who promote the patient’s contribution 
to healthcare outcomes. The contact personnel communicating with the 
customer in a manner that s/he comprehends plays an essential role in 
gaining their confidence. It shall cause them to reflect and change their 
behavior by performing new activities, disengaging from existing prac­
tices, and using resources in new ways. An improved interaction quality 
facilitates organizational learning and provides an understanding of 
patients’ value-creating processes. It assists in co-creation through the 
design and delivery of relevant customer experiences (Payne et al., 
2008). The contact personnel’s communication skills and emotional 
competence are essential in facilitating co-creation (Virl´
ee et al., 2020). 
We propose the following hypothesis based on the preceding 
discussion: 
H2.
Interaction quality is positively related to contribution to health­
care outcomes 
4.3. Knowledge development attitude and contribution to healthcare 
outcomes 
To evaluate the quality of health services, patients need relevant 
knowledge. Patients require a certain degree of knowledge to actively 
participate in decision-making and feel in control of the service trans­
action. It shall improve their health literacy and ability to meaningfully 
co-create value with healthcare personnel. The availability of several 
online resources has significantly altered information asymmetry and 
reduced the power imbalance between doctors and patients, facilitating 
mutual co-creation of value. Patients increasingly rely on online health- 
related information (using smartphones with internet connection) and 
their peers to overcome their shortcomings and develop competency. 
Patients bring their knowledge and experiences, contributing to new 
knowledge and skills of the contact personnel, thereby improving the 
overall service experience (Fusco et al., 2023). The patients’ service 
experience is influenced by the individual’s ability to be self-sufficient 
and proactive (Payne et al., 2008). Patient participation and health 
regulation directly affect perceived outcome value (Hau, 2019). 
We propose the following hypothesis based on our previous 
discussion: 
H3.
Knowledge development attitude is positively related to contri­
bution to healthcare outcomes 
4.4. Contribution to healthcare outcomes and continued patronage 
Value co-creation with the empowered patient heightens the firm’s 
sensitivity to market requirements. The firm then can respond timely to 
patients changing individual needs. It may positively affect health out­
comes, well-being, and quality of life (Pham et al., 2019). It also posi­
tively affects perceived quality (Kim, 2019) and value (Hau, 2019). 
Co-creation enhances the quality of customer relationships with con­
tact personnel and their trust. Although patients increasingly choose a 
healthcare professional and evaluate treatment based on reputation, 
online information, and services, trust remains the essential relational 
dimension (Barile et al., 2014). 
We propose the following hypothesis based on the preceding 
discussion: 
H4.
Contribution to healthcare outcomes is positively related to the 
continued patronage. 
4.5. Moderating effect of reduced ease of access on the relationship 
between (a) information exchange, (b) interaction quality and (c) 
knowledge development attitude, and contribution to healthcare outcomes 
In India, medical associations have very little influence on deciding 
the fee charged by the GP. The fee is determined by the establishment 
cost at the location and source of finance, equipment (and their main­
tenance) cost, staffing (primarily nursing and paramedical staff) cost, 
what others are charging for the service, and, very significantly, time 
spent (Bhat, 1999). Doctors in private healthcare facilities spend more 
time with their patients than their counterparts in public healthcare 
(Basu et al., 2012). More time spent with a patient leads to higher service 
charges to compensate for foregone revenue (Bhat, 1999). This nega­
tively impacts affordability and reduces the patient load on the health­
care facility. However, the more time spent by the doctor interacting 
with each patient higher the likelihood that all relevant information is 
exchanged and there is a mutual understanding of relevant issues (or, 
otherwise, the interaction is of good quality) (Camacho et al., 2014). 
Financial constraints may cause patients to choose service providers 
who charge less and have a corresponding higher patient load and ser­
vice waiting time. Such healthcare professionals are likely to spend less 
time interacting, compromising the patient’s ability to contribute during 
service transactions and obtain the desired healthcare outcomes. 
We propose the following hypotheses based on the preceding 
discussion: 
H5.
Reduced ease of access weakens the positive effect of information 
exchange on contribution to healthcare outcomes. 
H6.
Reduced ease of access weakens the positive effect of interaction 
quality on contribution to healthcare outcomes. 
Service-dominant logic is relevant today on account of the infor­
mation revolution. Besides one-to-one communication, smartphones 
with internet connectivity have made one-to-many and many-to-many 
communication commonplace. Besides resource integration with the 
health service provider, value co-creation requires patients to integrate 
resources between themselves. Patients, who use the internet and mo­
bile technologies, organize independently to help each other and co- 
create value by integrating their resources and experiences (Joiner 
and Lusch, 2016). The patient’s social network predicts higher perceived

outcomes and process values (Hau, 2019). 
A significant section of the Jharkhand population is unable to afford 
smartphones. Moreover, the rural part of Jharkhand, home to three- 
fourths of its population, has poor mobile connectivity and few mobile 
service providers (compromising the knowledge development potential 
of this section of the population). Studies reveal that a tiny percentage of 
smartphone users in backward states access online health-related in­
formation (James, 2020). Given that smartphones with internet con­
nectivity have been pivotal in facilitating communication and 
information search, stated factors might restrict the role of patients with 
financial constraints residing in backward areas to a passive recipient 
instead of an active co-producer of the service. This reduces the likeli­
hood of the patient’s perception of the service delivered matching 
his/her expectations, reducing his/her satisfaction level and relation­
ship measures that ensure continued patronage. 
We propose the following hypotheses based on the preceding 
discussion: 
H7.
Reduced ease of access weakens the positive effect of knowledge 
development attitude on contribution to healthcare outcomes. 
5. Methods 
5.1. Item generation 
We determined the potential items to measure each construct from 
health services and value co-creation literature. In an interview, five 
experts in academia (details provided in Table 1) evaluated the suit­
ability of the items and constructs. Following their recommendations, 
certain items were modified. The items are shown in Appendix A, and 
those from which they were adapted are shown in Table S1 (in the 
supplementary file). 
5.2. Pilot survey 
The pilot sample purifies the measurement scale and ensures the 
reliability & validity of the instrument before the large-scale survey. The 
questionnaire was self-administered to allopathic doctors treating dia­
betic patients (family members of the students in the author’s institu­
tion) residing in Jharkhand state. In Step 1, it was ascertained from the 
student that the patient obtained treatment in an outpatient clinic. 
Following this, the doctor’s clinic address and working hours were 
determined. In Step 2, the doctors were visited, and his/her response 
was obtained. The pilot survey collected a sample of 140 filled ques­
tionnaires, with no questionnaire filled being invalid, and the response 
rate was 56% (i.e., 250 questionnaires were distributed). 
We used a 7-point Likert-type scale: ‘strongly disagree’ (1) to 
‘strongly agree’ (7) to measure each item. The measuring instrument 
was purified by dropping certain items with a low Corrected Item-Total 
Correlation (CITC) measure. This step improved Cronbach’s alpha 
measure of the corresponding construct to ensure instrument validity. 
Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was applied to the remaining items to 
drop an item further and ensure instrument reliability. 
5.3. Large-scale survey 
Large-scale data were collected using a cross-sectional study where a 
structured questionnaire simultaneously measures the independent and 
dependent variables. The pilot study questionnaire, with items dropped, 
was self-administered to doctors in GP clinics who treat diabetic patients 
in the same manner as discussed previously. Overall, the large-scale 
survey collected a sample of 284 filled questionnaires, with no ques­
tionnaire filled being invalid, and the response rate was 64.54% (i.e., 
440 questionnaires were distributed). 
5.4. Structural equation modelling (SEM) 
SEM, a multivariate technique, is used to test simultaneously the 
hypothesized relationships, in complex structures with several inde­
pendent and dependent variables, even with mediation. The SEM com­
prises (1) a measurement model, which confirms the manifest variable 
represents the construct, based on the observed variable’s loading on the 
latent construct (thereby indicating scale reliability and validity), and 
(2) a structural model, which determines the hypothesized in-between 
construct relationship exists or does not. The measurement model uses 
confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) methodology. SEM compares the 
estimated and the observed covariance matrix to determine model fit. 
The recommended model fit values are Chi-square per degrees of 
freedom(df) of less than three, Goodness of fit index (GFI) greater than 
0.8, Root mean square error of approximate (RMSEA) lesser than 0.08, 
and Comparative fit index (CFI), Normed fit index (NFI), and Trucker 
Lewis Index (TLI) greater than 0.9 (Hu and Bentler, 1999). We use the 
software Analysis of Moment Structures (AMOS), Version 21, for this 
purpose. 
In Step 1 of the structural model, the direct effects of information 
exchange (H1), interaction quality (H2), and knowledge development 
attitude (H3) on contribution to healthcare outcomes and contribution 
to healthcare outcomes (H4) on continued patronage are first examined. 
Reduced ease of access (REoA) is added as a moderator variable in Step 
2. In Step 3, the interaction between REoA and each of the three con­
structs, information exchange, interaction quality, and knowledge 
development attitude, is added. 
The average value of the items corresponding to the latent constructs 
IE, IQ, KDA, CHO, and REoA is denoted by IE_A, IQ_A, KDA_A, CHO_A, 
and REoA_A. The independent variables (IE_A, IQ_A, and KDA_A) and 
the moderator variable (REoA_A) were mean-centered prior to the cre­
ation of the interaction terms REoAxIE, REoAxIQ, and REoAxKDA to 
reduce the chances of multicollinearity. 
5.5. Sample size 
A sample size of 150 is considered sufficient for convergence, and a 
proper solution provided the items for each factor are no less than three 
(Kline, 2015). We use a sample size of 284, which meets this criterion. 
5.6. Normality test 
In the case of SEM, the normality of the data set is required to ensure 
reliable estimates based on the maximum likelihood estimator. A high 
skewness and kurtosis of the data adversely influence the estimation. 
However, it was determined that the observed items had kurtosis be­
tween 0.003 and 4.725 and skewness between −1.556 and −0.261. The 
values are well within the recommended ±10 and ±3 range of kurtosis 
and skewness and, thereby, should not affect the estimates unduly 
(Bagozzi and Yi, 1988). SPSS 23 software was used for this purpose. 
5.7. Common method bias (CMB) test 
CMB can be assessed after receiving the data using Harman’s one- 
factor test. The result shows that the single factor explains 24.55% of

the variance, which is relatively less than 50%. Additionally, common 
latent factor (CLF) analysis was performed by comparing the regression 
weights of the constructs with and without CLF. The regression weights 
were less than 0.5, indicating no biasness in the data. This indicates that 
CMB is not a critical issue in this study (Podsakoff et al., 2003). 
5.8. Validity and reliability 
In CFA, the observed variables are regressed on the latent variables. 
CFA provides evidence of the validity and reliability of the instrument 
based on construct-wise average variance extracted (AVE), Cronbach’s 
alpha, and composite reliability (CR). 
6. Results 
6.1. Results of pilot study 
Table 2 provides the initial CITC value before dropping of non- 
representing items (purification), the final CITC value, alpha if 
deleted, and Cronbach’s alpha after scale purification. During the pu­
rification, seven items (IE2, IE4, KDA5, PC6, PC7, REoA3, and CP4) with 
CITC values less than 0.5 were dropped. The Cronbach’s alpha value of 
each construct is above 0.8 and indicates a high level of reliability. The 
items remaining were subjected to further purification using EFA. 
Table 2 provides the factor loading of each item on applying EFA (see 
the column of initial values) while suppressing item loading which are 
less than 0.4. The item IQ3 had a loading of less than 0.7 and was 
dropped, and the EFA was re-conducted. The final factor loading is 
where each item loads over 0.7 on its underlying construct, demon­
strating convergent validity (i.e., items measure the underlying 
construct) and discriminant validity (i.e., items do not measure other 
constructs). Each construct’s Cronbach’s alpha value exceeded the rec­
ommended value of 0.8, indicating scale reliability (internal consis­
tency). Thus, the scale purification resulted in 28 items to measure IE (3 
items), IQ (3 items), KDA (4 items), REoA (3 items), DP (5 items), PC (5 
items), and CP (5 items). 
6.2. Results of CFA 
Fig. S1 (in the supplementary file) depict the measurement model for 
first-order constructs. Table 3 provides CFA results: the construct-wise 
AVE, Cronbach’s alpha, and CR. The theoretical construct’s reliability 
is indicated by Cronbach’s alpha and CR values exceeding 0.5 and 0.7 
for each construct (Bagozzi and Yi, 1988). The standardized factor

loading for each item exceeds 0.7, and a value of AVE among a set of 
construct items exceeds 0.5, indicating that convergent validity is sup­
ported. The square root of each construct’s AVE is greater than the 
correlations between constructs, indicating an adequate level of 
discriminant validity, as shown in Table 4. 
Fig. S2 (in the supplementary file) depict the measurement model for 
second-order construct. The value of the T-coefficient (the ratio of the 
first-order model’s chi-square to the second-order model’s) exceeds 
0.80, which suggests that the second-order model is a more parsimo­
nious explanation of observed covariance than the first-order model 
(Doll et al., 1994) as shown in Table 3. 
6.3. Results of structural model 
The variance inflation factor (VIF) and tolerance corresponding to 
each regression coefficient were tested in SPSS using the independent 
variables IE_A, IQ_A, KDA_A, REoA_A, the three interaction terms, and 
the dependent variable CHO_A. The results are shown in Table S2 
(supplementary data). The VIF was less than four, and the tolerance was 
above 0.25, suggesting no multicollinearity issues (Hair et al., 2014). 
Also, the correlation between the independent variables IE_A, KDA_A, 
and IQ_A and the moderator variable REoA_A was determined to be 
0.244**, 0.094, and 0.265** and therefore weak (**implies significance 
at 0.01 level- two-tailed) and unlikely to confound the moderation effect 
(Hoyle and Panter, 1995). 
Figs. S3 and S4 (in the supplementary file) depict Step 1 and Step 3 of 
the structural model. We provide the structural model results, which 
examine the hypothesized relationships using the strength, direction, 
and significance level of path coefficients. Table 5 summarizes the re­
sults. In Step 1, the direct effects of IE (H1), IQ (H2), and KDA (H3) on 
CHO and CHO (H4) on CP are first examined. This method provides the 
variance proportion shared by adding the moderating variable in Step 2 
and interaction terms in Step 3. In Step 2, the addition of REoA increases 
the R2 value, suggesting an increase in the regression model’s predictive 
power. In Step 3, the addition of interaction terms increases further the 
R2 value. It is recommended that R2 (a change in the R2) value should 
not be below 0.25 (0.02) (Hoyle and Panter, 1995). The R2 value of 0.40 
(CHO) is a moderate value, and so is the change in R2 of 0.09. 
The SEM algorithm takes the specified model as true. It attempts to 
find the best fitting parameter estimates by increasing error terms if 
needed and reducing R2 and factor loadings to obtain good goodness of 
fit. The predictiveness of this study’s model is indicated by (1) factor 
loading exceeding 0.7, i.e., each measure accounts for 50% or more of 
the variance of the underlying latent variable, and (2) standardized beta 
coefficients, which exceed 0.125, and are statistically significant. Stan­
dardized beta coefficients less than 0.1 may be because everything 
correlates to one another to an extent (Hoyle and Panter, 1995). The 
model fit values are Chi-square/df. = 1.393, GFI = 0.896, RMSEA =
0.037, CFI = 0.972, NFI = 0.907, and TLI = 0.969. It demonstrates a 
satisfactory fit for the hypothesized structural model based on the rec­
ommended values in Section 5.4. 
7. Discussion and implication 
Hypotheses H1, H2, and H3 are significant, indicating that infor­
mation exchange and quality of interaction with the contact personnel 
and the development of relevant knowledge by the patient leads to his/ 
her empowering experience and improved contribution to healthcare 
outcomes. Hypothesis H4 is significant, indicating that patient’s 
contribution to healthcare outcomes improves the patient-contact 
personnel relationship through their participation in decision-making 
and control over his/her healthcare outcomes. 
Hypotheses H5 and H7 are significant, indicating that reduced ease 
of access weakens the stated positive effect of information exchange 
with the contact personnel and of the development of relevant knowl­
edge by the patient. However, we could not find evidence of reduced

ease of access weakening the stated positive effect of interaction quality 
with the contact personnel. 
7.1. Implications for patient needs 
Incomplete and asymmetric information affects the customer power 
in the relationship. The patients perceive a degree of risk owing to their 
limited understanding of the health system components (e.g., medica­
tion, surgery). Regardless, based on the achieved healthcare outcome 
and the corresponding cost, they are in the best position to assess the 
system’s value (the skill and knowledge to cure, share, and learn). The 
patients’ thoughts and opinions facilitate service improvement and, 
thereby, their satisfaction levels. They must, therefore, actively partic­
ipate in the value-creation process to reduce their perceived risk and 
gain equity in the service transaction. When patients actively contribute 
to healthcare outcomes, they are likely to develop an efficient, 
contented, and comfortable relationship with the contact personnel, 
causing them to bond effectively and continue their relationship. 
The contact personnel’s transfer of information about the healthcare 
service, the patient’s role, and the expected outcome reduces his/her 
perceived risk. Information provided by healthcare professionals is the 
basis for patients’ awareness of their health conditions. Information 
exchange reduces the asymmetric amount of information. It is necessary, 
but more is needed for patients’ contribution to achieving desired 
healthcare outcomes. Improving patient outcomes calls for the effec­
tiveness of co-creation processes. The contact personnel’s interaction 
quality improves the patient’s understanding of the information pro­
vided by healthcare professionals and their trust in the service provider. 
Trust in the service provider increases the likelihood of a long-lasting 
relationship despite any divergent perspectives (Barile et al., 2014) 
on, for example, some of the sacrifices necessary for the patient to 
improve care. 
A knowledge development attitude boosts the individual’s self- 
determination and self-efficacy and reduces his/her perceived risk. It 
promotes the patient’s active participation in decision-making to 
manage his/her health and gain maximum value from the service 
transaction. Studies, e.g., Neghina et al. (2015), provide credence to the 
positive link between customer knowledge-seeking tendency and 
his/her value in improving the service process through participation and 
feedback. 
Value co-creation requires the patients to effectively collate infor­
mation from peers with that obtained from health service providers and 
other resources to form thoughts and opinions, which are valuable in 
customizing the service to their specific needs and expectations. Patients 
with financial constraints who reside in communities with a higher 
patient load on healthcare facilities may perceive reduced power, 
communicate less confidently with the healthcare professional, and 
participate and contribute to a lesser extent in improving the service 
process. However, despite that, providing control over the service 
delivery through patient-centered communication and listening with 
empathy should reduce the service perception-expectations gap to 
improve patient satisfaction and healthcare outcomes at a lower cost 
(James et al., 2022). When a healthcare professional effectively uses the 
time spent with the patient to answer queries so that s/he understands 
and allay the patient’s fears and insecurities while gaining trust, s/he 
can clarify the patient’s role in contributing to healthcare outcomes and 
set service expectations overcoming the disadvantages of reduced ease 
of access. 
7.2. Implications for organization concerns 
Health organizations strive to maintain high economic indicators 
that call for processes that are efficient besides being effective at 
improving patient outcomes. Towards this end, they tend to add work­
load to an already overworked physician. The organization’s excessive 
focus on cost efficiency and service protocols may compromise the 
doctor’s ability to deliver expected health outcomes (which is essential 
for the patient). This calls for higher skills, more roles, increased re­
sponsibilities for nurse practitioners, and a move away from sole 
physician-led care (Carryer and Adams, 2017). 
Co-creating value with the patient increases the likelihood of 
achieving improved health outcomes earlier, reducing his/her expen­
diture over the care cycle (Moretta Tartaglione et al., 2018). The orga­
nization’s economic concerns are met since the resources are used more 
effectively and more efficiently over the reduced care cycle. The 
improved service increases the potential of the patient’s continued 
patronage and him/her recommending the service to other consumers. 
The GP clinics surveyed are small in terms of the number of em­
ployees. The extent to which resources are dedicated to building and 
maintaining customer relationships is dependent on the level of balance 
of power, an aspect most often neglected (Maloni and Benton, 2000). 
The clinic depends on the customer for its revenue and to promote its 
services. However, it holds power over the customer to the extent that its 
services are favored by him/her, suggesting a level of interdependence. 
Customers offer and receive information from peers on treatment 
options with different service providers and understand fellow cus­
tomers’ situations based on their experience. It improves the customer’s 
understanding of the expected service experience and their role as value 
co-creators. Marketing programs serve as a tool to motivate and 
empower customers to seek information and involve themselves in their 
routine healthcare. As customers increasingly seek health-related in­
formation, organizations’ websites and platforms such as Facebook and 
Twitter are ideal for facilitating it (Cavusoglu and Demirbag-Kaplan, 
2017). 
Compared to hospitals, GP clinics depend primarily on face-to-face 
interaction for marketing communication in the absence of resources 
as in the current context. Studies suggest that a patient tends to visit a 
hospital in an emergency. In a hospital, the patient is often not free to

choose the healthcare professional, and the on-duty doctor is assigned. A 
prior relationship or recommendation usually exists in the case of a GP 
clinic visit (James et al., 2022). The GP clinics surveyed have the 
advantage of being close to the patients enabling them to identify the 
desired patient outcomes, make home visits if needed and decide on new 
services (e.g., telemedicine) to improve availability and price the service 
appropriately to improve affordability. Telemedicine can improve ac­
cess by providing telephone-enabled (and, if possible, video-enabled) 
outpatient services (teleconsultation), monitoring and administering 
treatment to patients remotely based on data shared by a nurse practi­
tioner or the patient themselves (telemonitoring) and consulting spe­
cialty doctors (telementoring). 
Urban patients increasingly use wearables and digital apps, enabling 
them to take a more direct role in their care. In urban locations, health 
service managers should recommend technology to aid patients in self- 
monitoring and adopting healthy habits. Providing self-management 
tools gives the patient more control of the healthcare outcomes. In 
rural locations, technology aids in connecting and encouraging the 
community to seek medical help earlier (Anderson et al., 2018), pro­
moting sustainable development. 
To improve sustainability indices, healthcare organizations must 
coordinate resources across department and organization boundaries 
(Wagrell et al., 2022), share information, and collaborate with stake­
holders (Pereno and Eriksson, 2020). Hospitals are divided into de­
partments hindering the timely & accurate information exchange 
in-between them. Providing services may require investing in costly 
information systems to support operational-level activities (e.g., main­
taining patient records and managing appointments). Also, hospital 
personnel may change periodically, affecting any personal relationships 
that may have been built over time. The GP clinics surveyed have better 
potential to achieve social and economic sustainability due to the 
reduced decision hierarchy and lack of departmental barriers. 
8. Conclusion and direction for future research 
Sustainability in healthcare involves balancing the patient’s needs 
and the organization’s economic concerns. This study aims to inform 
health services of the value-creating activities that improve patient 
outcomes (patient’s need) and ensure the patient’s continued patronage 
(organization’s economic concern). The information asymmetric is 
reduced when healthcare customers co-create value with providers. 
Service and co-creation literature acknowledge that information sharing 
is a crucial co-creation process (Lusch et al., 2010). Besides ‘information 
exchange’ between contact personnel and customer (which reduces the 
asymmetric amount of information), this study also considers: (1) 
‘interaction quality,’ i.e., mutual understanding with the information 
exchanged effectively processed by both entities and (2) the customers’ 
knowledge development attitude, which reflects self-initiative to in­
crease skill and knowledge, as value-creating processes. Further, in the 
context of reduced ease of service access, we test the effectiveness of 
these processes in improving the patient’s contribution to healthcare 
outcomes (through decision participation and control over the service 
transaction) and, thereby, their continued patronage intention. 
This paper applies the S-O-R framework for analyzing the relation­
ships. It is proposed that the empowered patient’s contribution to 
healthcare is positively associated with continued patronage, and 
reduced ease of access weakens the positive effect of Information ex­
change, Interaction quality, and Knowledge development attitude on 
patient’s contribution to healthcare outcomes. By examining the effec­
tiveness of these relationships within the context of reduced ease of 
access, we gain a further understanding of how context influences them 
(Gokarn and Kuthambalayan, 2019). 
The instrument for measuring the constructs is developed for health 
services using well-supported measures from the literature. The ques­
tionnaire was self-administered to doctors in GP clinics who treat dia­
betic patients in Jharkhand (with limited public healthcare resources 
and a low-average per-person income). A pilot sample data (collected 
from 140 doctors) purified the measurement scale and ensured the 
reliability of the instrument before the large-scale survey. The large- 
scale survey data (collected from 284 doctors) validated the instru­
ment using CFA and tested the hypothesized relationships between the 
constructs using covariance-based SEM. 
The positive influence of information exchange and knowledge 
development attitude (interaction quality) on patients’ contribution to 
healthcare outcomes is (is not) weaker in reduced ease of access. The 
patients perceive a degree of risk owing to their limited understanding of 
the health system components. Stated value co-creating processes 
reduce their perceived risk, and promote decision participation and 
control over the service delivery, to improve trust in the service provider 
with an increased likelihood of a long-lasting relationship. Financial 
constraints and higher facility load reduce perceived power, causing the 
patients to communicate less confidently and contribute to a lesser 
extent. Thus, this study implies the heightened importance of ease of 
health service access to achieve healthcare outcomes. To overcome these 
disadvantages, healthcare professionals should effectively use the time 
with the patient to answer queries understandably and allay fears and 
insecurities with empathy. Thus, interaction quality is critical in clari­
fying the patient’s role in contributing to healthcare outcomes and 
setting service expectations, especially with reduced ease of access. 
Health services should manipulate ease of access through policy change 
and service innovations to meet patients’ needs effectively. These in­
sights may be valid in other transformative services, where the learnings 
shall improve the lives of individuals (e.g., education, social services) 
(Fusco et al., 2023). 
Co-creating value with the patient should improve patients’ out­
comes, improve relationship measures, and ensure continued patronage. 
Resources are used more effectively and efficiently over the patient’s 
reduced care cycle. In a hospital, the patient is often not free to choose 
the healthcare professional, while a prior relationship or recommenda­
tion usually exists in the case of a GP clinic visit. The GP clinics are 
unconstrained by departmental barriers and have the advantage of being 
close to the patients enabling them to identify the desired patient out­
comes, decide on new services, and improve availability and 
affordability. 
Existing research has limitations, as the data was collected from the 
GP clinic’s perspective. The self-selection bias of the respondents may 
have caused mostly doctors who understand the deficiencies of the 
paternalistic approach (in which the patient passively complies with the 
advice) to respond. Future work could also broaden the scope by 
considering (1) the patient’s perspective on this aspect and the other 
stakeholders (e.g., staff, caregivers, communities) balancing expecta­
tions (Pereno and Eriksson, 2020) and (2) a multi-dimensional measure 
of reduced ease of access. Studies suggest that GP clinics contribute 
much less than hospitals to healthcare emissions (Malik et al., 2018). 
Nevertheless, improving GP clinics’ environmental sustainability is 
essential for the healthcare system to achieve ‘net zero’ (Duindam, 
2022), especially in India, which has, for example, inadequate health­
care waste disposal measures (Thakur, 2021).

Objective: The prevalence of type 2 diabetes has shown a signiﬁcant in-
crease in parallel with health care costs. The objective of the Brazilian
Study on Diabetes Costs (ESCUDI study) was to estimate direct and indi-
rect costs of type 2 diabetes outpatient care in the Brazilian Public Health
Care System. Methods: Data were collected from different levels of
health care in eight Brazilian cities in 2007. A total of 1000 outpatients
were interviewed and had their medical records data analyzed. Direct
medical costs included expenses with medications, diagnostic tests, pro-
cedures, blood glucose test strips, and ofﬁce visits. Nonmedical direct
costs included expenses with diet products, transportation, and caregiv-
ers. Absenteeism, sick leave, and early retirement were classiﬁed as indi-
rect costs. Results: Total annual cost for outpatient care was US$2108 per
patient, out of which US$1335 per patient of direct costs (63.3%) and
US$773 per patient of indirect costs (36.7%). Costs escalated as duration of
diabetes and level of health care increased. Patients with both microvas-
cular and macrovascular complications had higher costs (US$3199 per
patient) compared to those with either microvascular (US$2062 per pa-
tient) or macrovascular (US$2517 per patient) complications only. The
greatest portion of direct costs was attributed to medication (48.2%).
Conclusions: Diabetes treatment leads to elevated costs both to Brazilian
Public Health Care System and society. Costs increased along with dura-
tion of disease, level of care and presence of chronic complications, which
suggested a need to reallocate health resources focusing on primary pre-
vention of diabetes and its complications.
Keywords: Brazil, costs, outpatient care, type 2 diabetes.

Introduction
The prevalence of diabetes in all age groups worldwide had been
estimated to reach 2.8% in 2000 and 4.4% by 2030. By then, the total
number of people with diabetes is projected to rise from 171 mil-
lion to 366 million [1]. Nearly two-thirds of individuals with diabe-
tes live in developing countries such as Brazil, India, and China,
where this number is expected to increase during the next two
decades [2]. A single nationwide study was carried out in Brazil in
the late 1980s and results showed 7.6% prevalence of diabetes in
people aged 30 to 69 years [3]. It is remarkable that nearly 50% of
those diagnosed with diabetes were not aware of their disease and
only 25% reported receiving care. More recent regional studies
showed an increase in prevalence rates: 12.1% in the city of Ri-
beirão Preto [4], 12.4% in Porto Alegre [5], and 13.5% in São Carlos
[6].
The Brazilian Public Health System (SUS) consists of a network
of district or basic health care units, hospitals, laboratories, and
blood banks essentially institutionalized to provide all Brazilian
citizens with comprehensive care.
Because direct and indirect costs of diabetes in Brazil are
unknown, public health policymakers and managers cannot
properly assess the real needs of patients with diabetes. There-
fore, different management approaches are inadequately eval-
uated and resources are not correctly and sufﬁciently allocated.
Moreover, the difﬁculty in accessing health services makes it
even harder to measure the actual burden of diabetes in Brazil.
In 2007, the Brazilian Society of Diabetes created a working group
with the purpose of estimating diabetes care costs in Brazil. Initially,
the group conducted the Brazilian Study on Diabetes Costs (ESCUDI
study) to estimate direct and indirect costs of outpatient care of a
selected sample of type 2 diabetes patients in the SUS.
Subjects and methods
A retrospective study based on data collected from different levels
of care (primary, secondary, and tertiary care units) in eight Bra-
zilian cities was carried out during the year 2007. Those cities were
selected based on geographical criteria (northwest, south, and
southeast), where health services were fairly organized, medical

records were available at different levels of care, and research on
diabetes was being conducted by local experienced investigators.
The study design included 50 patients per level of care, a total of
100 patients from medium-sized cities (Bauru, Itabuna, and Campina
Grande) and 150 patients from large cities (Fortaleza, Rio de Janeiro,
Porto Alegre, Ribeirão Preto, and São Paulo). In the city of São Paulo,
the only patients included were the ones from the secondary and
tertiary levels; altogether the ﬁnal sample comprised 1000 patients.
The inclusion criteria were being older than age 30 years and
having been followed-up at the health center for at least 1 year.
Exclusion criteria were being pregnant, older than age 75 years,
or having other diseases (human immunodeﬁciency virus, cancer,
or hepatic failure) that could signiﬁcantly affect the analy-
sis of resource use. Patients scheduled to attend the centers were
randomly selected for a face-to-face interview, which consisted of
a questionnaire developed by the main research group. The basis
of such research instrument came from a Pan American Health
Organization questionnaire, which had been previously used in
the Caribbean. The questionnaire was tested with 15 individuals
and amendments were made. It was administered in two phases:
patient data were collected through personal interviews, and then
data were collected by systematically reviewing medical records.
The subjects were classiﬁed into groups: those who had micro-
vascular (retinopathy, neuropathy, or nephropathy) and/or mac-
rovascular (cerebrovascular, coronary, or peripheral artery dis-
ease) complications. Such subdivision could only be possible once
they had reported signs or symptoms of any of those diseases or
had information in their medical records.
To participate in the study, all subjects read and signed an
informed consent form. The study was previously approved by the
Research Ethics Committee of the University of São Paulo/Ribeirão
Preto campus. Investigators conducted the research in accordance
with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.
Estimated costs
The economic effects of outpatient diabetes care were assessed
from the SUS and society perspectives over the course of 1 year.
Direct and indirect costs were taken into account.
There were costs in Brazilian currency (R$) attributed to all
resources utilized for the year 2007, which were then converted
into US dollars during the analysis using a purchasing power par-
ity basis for 2005: US$1  R$ 1.4 [7].
Direct costs were estimated using a bottom-up approach for
primary data collection [8] and divided into medical and nonmed-
ical costs. The direct medical costs assessed included medica-
tions, diagnostic tests, procedures, medical supplies (such as
blood glucose test strips), visits with health professionals (physi-
cians, nurses, nutritionists, physical therapists, dentists, and psy-
chologists), and hospital costs for emergency room visits (includ-
ing provider fees only). Medications used were categorized into
four groups: diabetes and obesity, cardiovascular and dyslipide-
mia, psychiatric, and others (all other classes of medications).
The direct nonmedical costs assessed included expenses with
artiﬁcial sweeteners and diet products, patient transportation to
attend clinic visits and laboratory testing, and expenses for hiring
a temporary caregiver during a patient recovery period. Due to the
wide variety of urban means of transport available (bus, train,
subway, car), a minimum amount corresponding to two regular
bus fares (US$3.10) was set to assess transportation expenses.
Total direct outpatient costs of diabetes care were deﬁned as
the sum of all direct medical and nonmedical costs. Primary data
collection on hospitalization costs was not performed.
Medical procedures, health professionals’ visits, and supplies
were assessed through reimbursements given to health centers
based on SUS management of Procedures, Medications, and Spe-
cial Supplies and Equipment System [9]. As for the assessment of
medications covered by SUS, the weighted mean of the last three
medication purchases made by public health units in 2007 was
based on the Brazilian Ministry of Health price database [10]. Med-
ications purchased at discount pharmacies cost nearly as much as
those covered by SUS. Medications purchased at private pharma-
cies included the price of generic medications, if available; if not,
the corresponding brand-name drug was obtained online through
a publication on medication prices with an added tax of 18% [11].
The indirect costs assessed were absenteeism and resulting
loss of productivity for the patients and their caregivers, sick leave,
and early retirement. The human capital approach was adopted to
estimate indirect costs. The mean monthly income and the value
of working hours were used to calculate workdays lost [8].
Statistical analysis
Data collected through questionnaires were electronically com-
piled by Epi-info 2000 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
Atlanta, GA). The statistical analysis was performed using SAS/
STAT version 9 (SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, NC). Variance analysis
models were constructed to compare quantitative variables from
the different levels of care, diabetes complications, and different
disease durations. Fisher’s exact test was carried out for compar-
ison. A 5% signiﬁcance level was set.
Results
Sample characteristics
There were a greater proportion of women receiving medical care
(66.5% women vs. 33.5% men). Mean age was 59.0  9.1 years and
mean duration of diabetes diagnosis was 11.2  7.8 years.
The self-reported prevalence of coronary artery disease was
70.4%, with a higher prevalence at the tertiary level compared to the
secondary and primary levels (P  0.001). The prevalence of self-
reported arterial hypertension (79.6%), cerebrovascular disease
(7.6%), and hypercholesterolemia (70.4%) were similar at all different
levels of care.
Home blood glucose monitoring was reported by 34.3% of the
sample (n  343).
Information on chronic diabetes complications was not available
in 38% of the sample (n  380) due to missing information in the
medical records. Out of the remaining patients (n  620), 28.9% had at
least one microvascular complication (micro group; n  289), 17%
had at least one macrovascular complication (macro group; n  171)
and 16% had at least one microvascular and one macrovascular com-
plication associated (micro/macro group; n  160).
The mean monthly income in the sample was US$543.35 and
the income of each day of work was US$18.11.
Direct costs
Total direct outpatient cost of diabetes care was US$1335 per pa-
tient/year, out of which US$1014 per patient/year expended on
direct medical costs and US$332 per patient/year on non-medical
costs.

Total annual cost of medications for 1000 patients was
US$747,356; US$563,506 paid by the public health system (SUS)
(75.4%) and US$183,849 paid by patients in private pharmacies
(24.6%). The expenses per patient/year with different medication
groups were: US$249 with diabetes/obesity (n  959); US$397 with
cardiovascular/dyslipidemia (n  905); US$321 with psychiatric con-
ditions (n  170), and US$285 with other medications (n  335). (See

The cost of home blood glucose monitoring was US$102,748
(US$299 per patient/year; n  343).
Annual expenses with artiﬁcial sweeteners and diet products
amounted to US$258,617 (US$286 per patient). Expenses related to
blood pressure monitoring were reported by 62 patients (US$59 per
patient) and only 15 patients reported expenses with hiring a tem-
porary caregiver (US$599 per patient). Patient transportation costs
for attending consultations and/or undergoing diagnostic tests to-
taled US$50,964 (US$52 per patient).
There was an increment in direct costs with diabetes progres-
sion and presence of diabetes complications (data not shown).
Indirect costs
Total indirect costs were US$773,212 (US$773 per patient/year),
which corresponds to 36.7% of total diabetes costs. (See Table 1 in
Supplemental Materials found at: doi:10.1016/j.jval.2011.05.009).
The lost of workdays corresponded to a loss of productivity of
US$437 per patient/year from those who reported having an income
(n  829). A total of 32 (3.2%) and 74 (7.4%) subjects reported diabetes-
related sick leave and early retirement, respectively, associated with
US$103,680 and US$410,702 expenses paid by the government. Job
loss due to diabetes was reported by 127 subjects (12.7%).
There was an increment in indirect costs with diabetes pro-
gression and presence of diabetes complications (data not shown).
Total costs
In the sample studied, the sum of direct and indirect costs amounted
to US$2,108,287 for 1,000 patients per year (US$2,108 per patient).
Total costs of diabetes care was US$ 1144 per patient at the
primary care level, US$2445 at the secondary level and US$2810 at
the tertiary level, with signiﬁcant differences among total costs at
the primary level and those at the secondary and tertiary levels
(P  0.01). (See Fig. 1A in Supplemental Materials found at: doi:
10.1016/j.jval.2011.05.009).
In regard to diabetes duration, there was an increment in total
costs as diabetes progressed: US$1971 per patient with diabetes
duration 10 years or fewer; US$2173 per patient in those with dia-
betes duration between 10 and 19 years and US$2544 per patient in
those with 20 years or more of diabetes duration (P  0.01 among
all the groups). (See Fig. 1B in Supplemental Materials found at:
doi:10.1016/j.jval.2011.05.009).
Total costs per patient from diabetes complications were as fol-
lows: US$2062 per patient in the micro group (n  289); US$2517 per
patient in the macro group (n  171) and US$3199 per patient in the
micro/macro group (n  160) (P  0.01 among all the groups). (See Fig.

Discussion
ESCUDI is the ﬁrst study conducted in Brazil showing a breakdown
of costs of type 2 diabetes outpatient care in the SUS. Data were
collected in eight cities with the purpose of describing health care
in different Brazilian regions (southern, southeastern, and north-
eastern). Total cost of diabetes outpatient care during a 1-year
period was US$2108 per patient/year, out of which 63.3% was di-
rect costs and 36.7% was indirect costs. As expected, costs in-
creased as diabetes progressed (23% cost increment in those with
10 or fewer years of diabetes duration compared to those with
diabetes duration of 20 years or more) and with the presence of
chronic complications (25% cost increment in those with both
complications compared to those with only one microvascular or
macrovascular complication). Similar results were described in a
previous cost analysis of chronic diabetes complications [12].
There was no difference in direct costs between secondary and
tertiary levels of care, but in general, costs were higher than the pri-
mary care level, where majority of patients are being treated.
A great and signiﬁcant portion of costs (36.7%) were due to
indirect costs of diabetes, which also include hidden expenditures
paid by society that are usually little known and not included in
government budget analyses. When comparing the annual costs
made by the individuals (nonmedical direct costs, purchased med-
ications, and loss of productivity) with their mean annual income
(US$6520), we could demonstrate that 14.4% of their income was
used for treatment.
The greatest portion of direct costs was attributed to medica-
tion (48.2%). Although the Brazilian health system has the respon-
sibility to provide drug treatment for any chronic disease, 24.6% of
the patients bought medicines from private pharmacies.
Previous studies on costs of diabetes clearly show that the
greatest proportion of costs is attributed to hospital admissions.
The CODE-2 study [13] demonstrated the medical costs of diabetes
care in eight European countries based on primary data collection
and database analysis. The estimated cost per patient per year was
€2834 and the largest portion of these costs was attributed to hos-
pital admissions (55%), mostly due to chronic diabetes complica-
tions, whereas only a small portion accounted for medication (4%).
Those European results are hardly comparable to our Brazilian
ones because these two studies had different approaches and the
former included costs of hospital admissions, which are very high.
The most recent American study on diabetes costs [14] shows an
estimated cost of US$174 billion in 2007, out of which US$116 bil-
lion was spent on health resources and US$58 billion was attrib-
uted to loss of productivity. Similar to the CODE-2 study [13], the
largest portion of costs were attributed to hospital admissions
(50%), followed by medication and medical supplies (12%) [14].
Again, these results cannot be appropriately compared to the Bra-
zilian ones because different methods were used (top-down ap-
proach vs. bottom-up approach). The ratio of direct cost to indirect
cost was similar in the Brazilian and American studies, reinforcing
the heavy burden of diabetes to individuals and society.
Rosa et al. [15] investigated the costs of public hospital admis-
sions in Brazil during 2 years (1999–2001) using diabetes as the
main diagnosis and the method of attributable risk associated to
all admissions. The estimated number of hospital admissions was
836,300 per year (49.3/104 inhabitants), with a cost of US$243,900
per year (14.4 million/104 inhabitants). Public expenditure related
to hospital admissions of individuals with diabetes was expressive
(2.2% of the Brazilian Ministry of Health budget) [15].
Our study has some limitations, such as lack of knowledge on the
actual situation of patients with diabetes regarding their regional
distribution, access to care, and disease severity, as well as the fact
that cities were randomly selected for data collection and are not
representative of the whole country. Because the patient selection
process was not ideal, some selection bias could be observed, such as
that the majority of included patients were women or workers. More-
over, considering the lack of information on chronic complications in
medical records, we analyzed the results separately. By doing so, we
conclude that, regarding level of care, age, social level, or other iden-
tiﬁable factor that can be considered a systematic selection bias,
there were no differences between those individuals with available
data which allowed the classiﬁcation of the presence of chronic com-
plications (n  620) and those without (n  380).
For the above reasons, results obtained in this sample may not
accurately reﬂect average costs of diabetes care in the whole country.
As a cost-of-illness study, the results were only descriptive, without
comparisons to other populations. The possibility to compare the
costs in a similar group without diabetes would in fact be much more
informative to managers of the SUS. However, there are no published
cost studies with primary data collection of the general Brazilian
population that could be used to compare to our results. Because our
S139
V A L U E I N H E A L T H 1 4 ( 2 0 1 1 ) S 1 3 7 – S 1 4 0
study did not collect data from patients without diabetes, we cannot
ensure that the costs were attributed exclusively to diabetes.
The ﬁndings of our study indicate a serious economic threat
posed by diabetes that public authorities and all social sectors
have to face. The noninclusion of hospital costs in the analysis
resulted in an underestimate of the actual total cost of diabetes
care in Brazil. The high percentage of indirect costs reveals hidden
losses posed by diabetes that need to be taken into account. How-
ever, even with the inclusion of nonmedical and indirect costs in
the study, not all the harm caused by diabetes were considered.
There are intangible costs such as pain, suffering, and loss of qual-
ity of life that were not shown.
The increasing incidence and prevalence of diabetes evidenced
by epidemiologic studies worldwide represents a growing burden
that most health systems are unable to deal with. There is an imper-
ative need to develop and improve interventions toward prevention
of diabetes and its complications and to reorganize resources to im-
prove the effectiveness of health care. If this is not done, the public
ﬁnancing of diabetes treatment will be unviable in a near future, with
deleterious consequences for the health of the Brazilian population.

ABSTRACT
Background and rationale. Cirrhosis is responsible for significant health-care costs and morbidity. This stu-
dy aims to evaluate the burden of illness associated with cirrhosis, its impact on the universal coverage
public health care system in Thailand. Material and methods. We used data from the 2010 Nationwide Hos-
pital Admission Data, the National Health Security Office (NHSO), Thailand. Their baseline characteristics,
hospital costs, and outcomes were analyzed according to national health insurance categories including
medical welfare scheme (MWFS), social security scheme (SSS) and civil servant medical benefit scheme
(CSMBS). Results. 92,301 admissions were eligible for analysis. The mean age was 55 ± 12.8 years, and 63.3%
of patients were above 50 years old. The majority of patients (79%) belonged to the MWFS group. The
MWFS group incurred the lowest medical expense and had the shortest hospital stay compared to the SSS
and CSMBS groups. Overall in-hospital mortality was 10.7%. Cirrhosis complications include bleeding eso-
phageal varices, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, hepatic encephalopathy, hepatorenal syndrome, and
hepatocellular carcinoma. These complications significantly increased mortality rates compared to pa-
tients without complications (26 vs. 8.9%, p < 0.001). In-hospital mortality of patients with cirrhosis compli-
cations did not differ among the three national health insurance groups. Respiratory failure and septicemia
were associated with the highest risk of death (HR 5.4; 95% CI: 4.8-5.9 and HR 5.2; 95% CI: 4.9-5.6 respecti-
vely; P < 0.001). Conclusions. Illness associated with cirrhosis is a significant public health problem in Thai-
land. Outcomes of cirrhosis complications did not differ between universal public health care coverage
systems in Thailand.
Key words. Liver-related mortality. Cirrhosis complications. Health care reform. Population. Cost.

ORIGINAL ARTICLE
INTRODUCTION
Cirrhosis is the end-stage of every chronic liver
disease. Its natural history is characterized by an
asymptomatic phase followed by a rapidly progressive
phase marked by the development of complications of
portal hypertension and/or liver dysfunction.1 Vari-
ous common chronic liver diseases such as alcohol
consumption, metabolic syndromes related to over-
weight and obesity, viral hepatitis B and C have end
results of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcino-
ma.2 Reviewed data in Europe demonstrated that
cirrhosis-associated mortality is at least comparable
with other diseases that are considered to be of ma-
jor public health concern, such as breast cancer, co-
lon cancer, chronic lung disease and renal diseases.3
Liver-related mortality has been underestimated
during the past two decades in the United States
and Brazil.4,5 There are nearly as many mortality
cases attributed to complications of cirrhosis as
there are to diabetes, and more than are attributa-
ble to kidney diseases.6 Cirrhosis is also responsible
for significant health-care costs and morbidity, and

the incidence of hospitalizations due to cirrhosis
complications is increasing.7-9 Besides cirrhosis com-
plications, various co-morbidities such as diabetes,
cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease
also affect the prognosis of cirrhosis patients.10 A
study in chronic hepatitis B patients in Thailand
showed that the yearly cost of treatment for pa-
tients with end-stage liver disease including cirrho-
sis was five times higher than chronic liver disease
without cirrhosis.11 Previous reports of population-
based prevalence rates of cirrhosis in Nakhon Nay-
ok Province showed that standardized prevalence
rates are 75.3 per 100,000, and prevalence is higher
among males than females, particularly for alcoholic
cirrhosis.12
Health-financing reforms in Southeast Asia have
sought to reduce dependence on out-of-pocket pay-
ments, increase pooled health finance, and expand
service use as steps towards universal coverage.13
Thailand developed a universal coverage public
health care system in 2002.14,15 All citizens received
individualized national insurance depending on
work and public health classification to ensure basic
health care services. Outcomes, economic burden,
and the effect of the public health care system of cir-
rhosis in Thailand have not been well researched.
We aim to evaluate the burden of illness associated
with cirrhosis in Thailand and its effect on the na-
tional health insurance systems.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Data sources
We analyzed cirrhosis data among hospitalized
patients in Thailand from the 2010 Nationwide Hos-
pital Admission Data, the National Health Security
Office (NHSO), Thailand. Data consisted of inpa-
tient information from three health insurance cover-
age schemes (Medical Welfare Scheme, MWFS,
Social Security Scheme, SSS, and Civil Servant Med-
ical Benefit Scheme, CSMBS), which covered 77%
(MWFS), 10% (SSS), and 13% (CSMBS) of all ad-
missions. All patients with cirrhosis diagnosis
(ICD10-K74) aged at least 19 years old were includ-
ed. Their baseline characteristics, hospital costs,
and outcomes were analyzed according to national
health insurance category.
Universal coverage public health care system
Thailand adopted a universal public health care
system in 2002, which is comprised of three nation-
al health insurance categories –Civil Servant Medi-
cal Benefit Scheme (CSMBS), Social Security
Scheme (SSS), and Medical Welfare Scheme
(MWFS). CSMBS includes all civil servant officers
with close family which individually reimburses
medical expenses from the Controller General’s De-
partment. SSS includes all Thai employees who are
registered to the National Social Security Fund.
MWFS includes all the remaining Thai citizens in
the national database, which can access public
health services from public hospitals and private
hospital registered with The National Health Secu-
rity Office. All national health insurances cover ba-
sic healthcare services, however there are some
differences between them. CSMBS covers some medi-
cations that are part of the National List of Essen-
tial Medicines, and liver transplant, whereas other
schemes do not cover this. There are also some dif-
ferences in hospital room fee reimbursement rules
among these insurances.
In Thailand, government hospitals are classified
into three levels, primary hospital is community
hospital for primary healthcare, secondary hospital
is a hospital for general healthcare, and tertiary
hospital is a referral hospital for complicated diseas-
es and specialized healthcare.
Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were performed using
SPSS version 13 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Continu-
ous variables were compared between groups using
unpaired t-test and one-way ANOVA. Categorical
variables were compared between groups using
F2/Fisher’s exact test. Multiple logistic regression
analysis was used to adjust the odds ratio for the
factors influencing mortality rate. The odds ratio
and 95% CI of each factor are presented. P < 0.05
was considered statistically significant.
Ethical consideration
This study was done with approval from The Gas-
troenterological Association of Thailand in collabo-
ration with The National Health Security Office,
Thailand. The research protocol was approved by
the Institutional Review Board, Faculty of Tropical
Medicine, Mahidol University (MUTM 2014-056-01).
RESULTS
In the year 2010, Thailand’s over 19-year-old pop-
ulation was 47.97 million, which accounted for 74%

SSS and CSMBS groups – both for patients with and
without complications. After categorizing according
to cirrhosis complications including bleeding es-
ophageal varices, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis,
hepatic encephalopathy, hepatorenal syndrome and
hepatocellular carcinoma-related complications, the
MWFS group still incurred a significantly lower
medical expense (Table 3).
Cirrhosis patients in the MWFS group had signif-
icantly shorter admission durations compared to the
SSS and CSMBS groups, despite cirrhosis complica-
tions (Figure 1). In-hospital mortality of patients
with cirrhosis complications did not differ among
the three groups (Figure 2). Comorbidities and cir-
rhosis complications were significantly correlated
with patient survival. Respiratory failure requiring
continuous invasive mechanical ventilation for 96
consecutive hours or more, and septicemia were as-
sociated with the highest risk of death (HR 5.4; 95%
CI: 4.8-5.9 and HR 5.2; 95% CI: 4.9-5.6 respectively;
P<0.001) (Table 4).
The etiology of liver cirrhosis was identified in
31,423/92,301 (34%) of cases. Out of these, the
causes were identified as alcoholic liver disease
in 73%, chronic hepatitis B in 14%, chronic hepati-
tis C in 12.6%, and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis
(NASH) in < 1%.
DISCUSSION
In 2010, cirrhosis accounted for 1.3 million deaths
around the world, about 2% of global deaths.16

of the country’s population (64.7 million). The total
number of adult inpatients was 3.87 million, who
were admitted 4.86 million times, accounting for
71% of all inpatients. The diseases of digestive sys-
tem were the third leading cause of hospitalization,
which accounted for 379,532 admissions, or 10% of
all admissions. Among admissions of digestive sys-
tem, 92,301 admissions for cirrhosis (24.3%) were el-
igible for analysis.
The mean age of patients admitted with cirrhosis
was 55 ± 12.8 years and 63.3% of patients were
above 50 years old. The male to female ratio was 2:1,
most patients were hospitalized in primary level hos-
pitals, and in the central part of Thailand. The ma-
jority of patients (79%) belonged to the group of
MWFS (Table 1).
The overall in-hospital mortality was 10.7%. Cir-
rhotic patients with complications including bleed-
ing esophageal varices, spontaneous bacterial
peritonitis, hepatic encephalopathy, hepatorenal
syndrome, and hepatocellular carcinoma-related
complications had significantly higher mortality rate
than those patients without complications (26 vs.
8.9%, p < 0.001). The overall mean length of hospi-
tal stay was 5.8 days in cirrhosis patients. Longer
durations, up to 8.6 days, were observed in patients
with cirrhosis complications. Hepatorenal syndrome
was the complication that caused the longest admis-
sion period, up to 10.2 days, and the highest mortal-
ity rate, up to 42.6% (Table 2).
Cirrhosis patients in the group of MWFS incurred

According to the National Center for Health Statis-
tics (NCHS), chronic liver disease and cirrhosis is
the 12th leading cause of death in the United States.
The highest risk groups consist of persons aged 45
to 54 years and 55 to 64 years, where chronic liver
disease and cirrhosis are the 4th and 7th leading
cause of death.4,17
Our data supports that liver cirrhosis is a public
health problem in all areas and at every hospital
level in Thailand. Mortality rate of hospitalized liv-
er cirrhosis patients in Thailand 2010 was 10.7%,
compared to the overall mortality rate of inpatients
of 4.4, 1.4 and 3.3% in CSMBS, SSS, and MWFS
groups accordingly. In analysis of data from the
National Health Security Office (NHSO), Thailand
(2010), cirrhosis-related deaths was 20.5/100,000
persons which is comparable to estimated liver-
related deaths in United State (25.7/100,000 persons

in 2008).4 Mortality rates of hospitalized cirrhosis
patients range from 3.3 to 40% depended on severi-
ty of cirrhosis, complications, and co-morbidi-
ties.5,18,19 Cirrhosis complications significantly
increase risk of death. According to our data, hepa-
torenal syndrome was the most fatal complication
of cirrhosis, which might be due to decompensated
liver disease and insufficient liver transplantation.
We found that only 19 liver transplants have been
done in this registry data, compare with more than
2,500 endoscopic interventions for bleeding esopha-
geal varices. Our data were consistent with previ-
ous data, and show that infectious and renal
complications in persons with cirrhosis directly im-
pact clinical outcomes.20,21 These data support that
morbidity and mortality due to cirrhosis and its
complications are significant public health prob-
lems in Thailand.
Length of hospital stay and hospital expenses in-
curred were higher in SSS and CSMBS groups, com-
pared with MWFS, however no statistically
significant differences were found in mortality rates
from the various cirrhosis complications.
Acute-on chronic liver failure (ACLF) is distinct
from acute decompensation and has been significant-
ly related to death in patients with cirrhosis.22 This
study has limitations, since it is related to a retro-
spective survey, and non-specialized doctors are
more prone to describe all morbid events in cirrhosis
as decompensation. The absence of data description
on ACLF does not mean that these cases are rare.
Etiology of cirrhosis could only be determined in
34% of cases, and a better method to define etiology
of cirrhosis in Thailand should be developed, since
its treatment and prevention is essential for better
patient care.
Base on this limited data, alcoholic liver disease
might be one of the significant causes of liver cir-
rhosis consistent with previous report,23 however
out-patient data from the liver clinic in King Chu-
lalongkorn Memorial hospital, Thailand, showed
that chronic hepatitis B was the most common eti-
ology (44.7%), followed by chronic hepatitis C
(29.7%), alcoholic liver disease (14.8%), NASH
(6.7%), and autoimmune hepatitis(4.1%) (unpub-
lished data). These data suggest that most alcohol-
ic patients did not access healthcare before
admission from cirrhosis-related illness.
Alcohol consumption, viral hepatitis B and C, and
metabolic syndromes related to overweight and obesity
are the leading causes of cirrhosis and primary liver
cancer.24-26 Prevention and treatment interventions in
those conditions and risk factors are necessary to con-
trol further morbidities, mortality, and economic bur-
den related to cirrhosis.
In conclusion, illness associated with cirrhosis is
a significant public health problem in Thailand, with
a mortality rate of up to 26% in hospitalized pa-
tients with decompensated forms of cirrhosis. Pre-
ventive measures are very important to reduce the

ences among the three health care systems were

The cell-free system is a tool that harnesses the complex biological processes outside of living cells. Owing to the 
system’s superior flexibility and manipulability, it has matured its technological and scientific potential for more 
than five decades, with exponential growth in research in the twenty-first century. While the conventional cell- 
free system has been utilized to understand cellular physiology and protein synthesis by in vitro transcription and 
translation reaction, in recent years, the cell-free system has evolved into a practical biomanufacturing platform, 
as well as a substantial research framework for synthetic biology. This comprehensive review covers recent 
milestones and achievements of the cell-free system as a new apparatus in healthcare, including cell-free bio­
sensing and screening, biomanufacturing of medicine and therapeutics, and system portability.   
1. Introduction 
The cell-free system (CFS) is a flexible in vitro technology that sep­
arates cell growth from the target production to reformulate cellular 
processes outside of the living cell [1]. It is the legacy of the pioneering 
landmark research by Nirenberg and colleagues in the sixties [2,3], and 
is now making a comeback, blooming its science and engineering sig­
nificance in the age of synthetic biology [4]. 
The crude cell lysate (extract) is the major supplier of the cell-like 
environment in the microtube reaction and determines the systems’ 
characteristics, playing a pivotal role in the operations of the system. 
The basic principles of the CFS preparation, in addition to the cell 
extract, begin with the removal of endogenous genetic materials and the 
cell wall, and the addition of supplements to support gene transcription 
and translation. Thus, the protein can be synthesized without the burden 
of certain bacterial growing conditions, which limits the platform 
expandability of living cells [1] (Fig. 1). The simplicity of adding a gene 
(circular plasmid or linear expression template) by pipetting, not by 
transformation like in vivo methods, allows for easy conversion of the 
system, not only for the rapid biomanufacturing factory of proteinous 
molecules, but also into a versatile biosensing platform due to the open 
nature of the CFS [5,6]. By taking advantage of the unique features of 
the system, the CFS has enabled, in terms of protein synthesis, high 
synthesis rate and product yield [7]; post-translational modifications 
including: the creation of disulfide bonds [8–10], glycosylation [11–17], 
and site-specific phosphorylation [18,19]; the increase in enzyme 
functionality and protein stability [20] by: optimizing condition for 
aggregation-prone proteins [21,22], increasing activity of cofactor 
proteins [23,24], and the production of hard-to-express proteins 
including mammalian proteins [8,25–27]; the incorporation of unnat­
ural and non-canonical amino acids into synthesized proteins [28–44]; 
rapid design-build-test models by expressing recombinant proteins 
directly from PCR-amplified genes, [45–51] and reusable DNA template 
platforms [52]; the use of creative methods to maximize production of 
protein/substrate of interest including: specific compartmentalization of 
protein synthesis [53–57], the ability to control energy and substrate 
consumption and regeneration or replenishment [58–63], the ability to 
control temperature for target protein production [64], the creation of 
resilient DNA nanotubes [65], and a high tolerance for toxic substrates 
or products [66]; the production of therapeutic proteins including an­
tibodies [67–72], cancer therapeutics [73–75], stroke and neurological 
disorders [76,77], and antibiotics [78]. 
In terms of utilizing the system, the CFS has enabled the ability of 
prototyping to quickly and meticulously study many biological path­
ways [79–82] and to closely study the synthesis and function of ribo­
somes [83,84]; rapidly analyze systems by: rapid enzyme and protein 
screening [5,6,85–96] and the ease to measure output from input 
manipulation to convert to robust computational modeling [97,98]; the

design of complex genetic circuitry networks [55,56,99–104]; 
on-demand 
biomanufacturing 
[105–108]; 
point-of-care 
testing 
[109–122]; and easy production of educational kits [123–126]. The CFS 
is also a versatile platform, allowing the focus to be either on protein 
production, metabolic pathways, or cell studies. These focuses branch 
out into several categories: cell-free protein engineering [127], cell-free 
protein synthesis (CFPS) [128], cell-free metabolic engineering (CFME) 
[129], artificial cell engineering [130], and cell-free chemical biosyn­
thesis [131]. 
Given these advantages and recent technical improvements, the CFS 
could be an important tool in the healthcare system. The reasons being 
include the following: the inexpensive requirements in small batches, 
on-demand biomanufacturing and modulation can be widely distributed 
to many areas providing easy access for more people [109,110,132]; the 
open nature of the systems stimulates studies and the development of 
more complex sensing networks and therapeutics by escaping the 
competition of metabolic resources that are required for retaining the 
life of the cell [133]; also, the low-cost advantage this system allows for 
high-value biopharmaceuticals, natural products, and more advances in 
research since more studies will be able to be conducted in shorter 
periods. 
The most common organism used for the extract of CFSs is Escher­
ichia coli because of its capacity to grow in low-cost media, ease of lysis, 
high protein yields, ability to fold complex proteins, and low reaction 
costs [1,7], thus, here we will mainly focus on E. coli-based CFS systems. 
This comprehensive review will spotlight the healthcare applications of 
CFS. First, we explore various cell-free biosensors for detection and 
diagnosis. We then discuss cell-free biomanufacturing of protein-based 
drugs and the potential of a cell-free metabolic engineering platform. 
We also examine the recent achievement of an on-demand portable CFS 
option. Finally, we discuss the advancement of CFS for pathway 
prototyping. 
2. Cell-free biosensing 
2.1. RNA sensing 
The acceleration in synthetic biology research has resulted in the 
ability to finely control gene expression to study pathways or use gene 
regulation as a biosensing platform [134,135]. However, the 
whole-cell-based 
biosensors 
are 
limited 
in 
their 
logistics, 
time-consuming preparation and assay, and expenses [136]. These di­
lemmas can be resolved by utilizing the CFS for rapid, sensitive, and 
accurate assays. More complex genetic networks have been able to be 
engineered, including ribonucleic acid (RNA)-based regulators, by using 
the CFS. Nucleic acid detection using these RNA regulators is an effec­
tive sensing method to detect certain genetic materials, either from an 
infecting host or a mutation of the host, for a more in-depth under­
standing of the problem in the host [137]. Polymerase chain reaction 
(PCR) has been established as the gold standard method for nucleic acid 
detection, but the PCR-based method requires expensive materials and 
equipped laboratory facilities [138]. Therefore, RNA-based regulators’ 
usage in the CFS has become popular because the reaction is less 
expensive and can occur outside the lab. 
Collins and colleagues have shown a new and improved, program­
mable riboswitch (the toehold switch) for the rapid indication of the 
illness of interest by colorimetric visualization (Fig. 2B) [109–111,139]. 
The first development of toehold switches was demonstrated in 
whole-cells for antibiotic resistance detection (chloramphenicol and 
spectinomycin) detection and for sensing a low-iron condition caused by 
RNAs [139]. Then, Pardee and Green successfully integrated the toehold 
switch and the CFS for the rapid detection of the Ebola virus at 
strain-specific levels in a lyophilized setting of the CFS [109]. Pardee 
et al. further developed the technology to rapidly detect the RNA of the 
Zika virus at femtomolar levels by isothermal amplification while also 
maintaining low-maintenance and low-cost storage and practice that 
offers easy distribution of the technology throughout the world [110]. 
Takahashi et al. successfully expanded the technology to analyze the gut 
microbiome to detect ten different bacteria that affect human health and 
four clinically relevant host biomarkers. This includes the diagnosis of 
the serious bacterial infection caused by Clostridium difficile [111]. 
The toehold switches operate by binding to an RNA trigger strand 
with complementary base pairing. This binding then releases the 
toehold switch’s secondary structure that is sequestrating the ribosome 
binding site (RBS) and start codon allowing the colorimetric protein to 
be translated and detected to verify if the RNA sequence of interest is 
present (Fig. 2B) [110]. The toehold switches are unique riboregulators 
because they do not sequester the RBS by base pairing. In this way, the 
trigger RNA does not need to contain an RBS sequence. Additionally, the 
toehold switch allows the riboswitch designer to exploit linear-linear 
interactions and do away with U-turn sequences and loop-mediated 
RNA interactions. Both of these factors increase the amount of RNA 
that can be detected [139]. Pardee et al. used thermodynamic consid­
erations to optimize the toehold switch design by reducing the size of the 
loop containing the RBS, further stabilizing the stem of the sensor by 
adding nucleotides and removing the downstream refolding domain. All 
these factors decrease leakage of false ON states while increasing the 
free energy required to unwind the sensor [110]. They call this series of 
switches the “B Zika Sensors.” Overall, this series contains a leader 
sequence of three guanines to encourage efficient transcription by T7 
RNA polymerase, the exposed complementary trigger section (around 
12-nt), a sequestered 9-nt continuation of the complementary sequence 
to the trigger, a conserved sequence region containing the sequestered 
start codon in a 3-nt bulge and the sequestered RBS in a 12-nt loop, an

exposed 21-nt low-weight amino acid sequence, and the protein of in­
terest sequence [110,139]. 
Colorimetric protein selection and development can enhance the 
RNA sensing level. Previous toehold switch research used fluorescent 
proteins such as GFP and mCherry or a chromogenic substrate respon­
sive enzyme such as beta-galactosidase (LacZ) as the output protein 
[110,139]. LacZ is ideal for point-of-care diagnostics, where having a 
fluorescent reader would be costly and burdensome since it is a colori­
metric output color change from yellow to purple. Unfortunately, LacZ is 
a fairly large protein, larger than fluorescent reporters like GFP and 
mCherry, requiring more energy for transcription and translation, thus, 
lowering the amount made. Therefore, Ma et al. developed a split LacZ 
by dividing the protein into two parts, ɑ and ω, and having the toehold 
switch sequestered the sequence for LacZɑ (which is only 180-nt long) 
and supplemented the already synthesized LacZω, allowing for a much 
greater colorimetric response [112]. Split LacZ was one of the new 
features for low-limit detection using the toehold switch, but they also 
tested more additions, including concentrating the virus from dilute or 
large-volume samples using Synbodies [112]. These Synbodies are 
synthetic bivalent affinity ligands that can screen and bind to a protein 
of interest, similar to an antibody, but they can recognize a larger range 
of similar proteins in case the norovirus starts evolving [140]. Synbodies 
have biotin groups which then can be captured by streptavidin-coated 
magnetic beads. This method of concentrating allows for decreased 
waiting time for naked-eye detection of the LacZ reaction after ampli­
fication compared to non-concentrated samples, resulting in a 1000-fold 
improvement in detection limit. Regarding amplification methods, they 
compared nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) [141] 
and reverse transcriptase recombinase polymerase amplification [142] 
and found NASBA was better at detecting a lower concentration of the 
virus, down to 2 fM detection by naked-eye within 2 h. Thus, Ma and 
others increased the sensitivity of toehold switch virus detection, 
allowing for 270 aM concentrations of norovirus to be detected from 
stool samples and concentrations at 270 zM within 3 h when coupled 
with Synbody concentration [112]. 
2.2. Hormone sensing 
Hormones regulate numerous functions in the human body and can 
give many clues about the patient’s current state of health [143]. Human 
endocrine systems as a whole are largely disrupted by invisible enemies 
that exist in our food, environment, and household products [144]. 
These endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) have become a public 
safety concern because they can mimic our natural hormones and bind 
to receptors, setting off numerous biological pathways [136,145,146]. 
To give some control back to the public in regards to defending their 
health, Salehi et al. have created a rapid, reliable, and cost-effective 
screening method called RAPID (Rapid Adaptable Portable In-vitro 
Detection biosensor platform) which uses the CFS to detect 
endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) that interact with the human 
estrogen receptor β (hERβ) [114] (Fig. 2A). The CFS creates a 
four-domain allosterically activated fusion protein biosensor which 
contains the ligand-binding domain of a nuclear hormone receptor 
(NHR), stabilizing intein and maltose-binding domains, and a bound 
reporter enzyme, β-lactamase (β-lac). If the EDCs of interest is present, it 
binds to the NHR and enhances the folding of the entire biosensor 
construct, thus increasing the activity of the bound β-lac, revealing a 
colorimetric signal [114]. In less than two hours, the RAPID biosensor 
could detect bisphenol A (BPA), β-estradiol (E2), and diarylpropionitrile 
(DPN) from blood and urine samples. The RAPID biosensor is not 
analyte-specific like other biosensors since it relies on direct binding 
with an NHR. Before this work, they used the biosensor to interact with 
the Human thyroid receptor β (hTRβ) [136]. Then by simply replacing 
the hTRβ domain with the estrogen receptor domain (hERβ), they were 
able to detect the EDCs, displaying the technology’s flexibility [114]. In 
their previous research in 2017 with hTRβ, they were able to lyophilize 
the system for on-demand testing and were able to test it with water 
sources from the environment and in the home as well as bodily fluids, 
and still receive a clear response [136]. In their 2018 paper with hERβ, 
they mentioned it would be just as easy to incorporate the estrogen re­
ceptor EDC sensor platform into a lyophilized assay. 
Fig. 2. (A) RAPID biosensor: an endocrine- 
disrupting chemical (EDC) detector. The CFS 
system creates an allosterically activated fusion 
protein that contains a ligand-binding domain 
of a nuclear hormone receptor (NHR) along 
with a reporter enzyme. When EDCs are pre­
sent, they bind to the human estrogen receptor 
β (hERβ) NHR causing an allosteric change that 
triggers the activation of a reporter protein 
[114]. (B) The toehold switch biosensor: a

2.3. Detection of harmful chemicals and heavy metals 
With the CFS’s portability and easy maintenance aspects, the 
lyophilized format has broadened the sensing capabilities of harmful 
substances in our environment. Gr¨
awe et al. developed a cell-free a 
gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) and heavy metals (Hg(II) ions) sensing 
platform in a lyophilized CFS format (Fig. 2D1) [120]. In this research, a 
mercury dependent operon developed in a previous study, the MerR 
transcriptional activator, was used for regulating transcription and 
translation of fluorescent protein in the presence of as little as 6 μg/L of 
Hg(II) ions [120,147,148]. The transcriptional repressor BlcR was 
employed for the detection of GHB. Once GHB binds, the BlcR is 
released, allowing for translation of the gene cluster [149,150]. The 
sensitivity of this platform is practical when determining if the intoxi­
cation occurred once the chemical is ingested (usually about 2 g). It is 
metabolized quickly, resulting in low concentrations in the blood and 
urine (10 μg/mL and 15 μg/mL, respectively). As a result, the CFS has 
accomplished a sensitive and accurate detection of toxic chemicals as 
compared to the clinic standard. 
Although the reporter gene sfGFP folds rapidly and remains stable 
under harsh conditions [92,151], the fluorescent signal encounters a 
time delay upon contact with the sample, so it is not useful when trying 
to prevent immediate encounters with date-rape drugs or mercury. This 
is an example where this technology could be improved, maybe by 
utilizing a greater exponential sfGFP output using a genetic circuit 
cascade or RNA aptamer. They did try implementing a synthetic 5′-UTR 
(untranslated region) translation enhancing sequence that was down­
stream of the T7-promoter and upstream of the sfGFP gene [120,152]. 
This sequence greatly increased the ribosomal efficiency, thus tremen­
dously increasing the sfGFP yield. It took 100 min for the reaction to 
reach its peak and only about 50 min to reach half of the max of RFU’s. 
Another strategy this team implemented to increase sfGFP yield was 
adding RraA, an E. coli RNase E inhibitor protein, which increased the 
signal by 33% after 2.5 h [120,153] but did not make the amplification 
time any shorter. 
The next few publications strive to protect citizens by detecting 
harmful chemicals or levels of molecules in the citizens’ water supply 
and environment. Thavarajah et al. constructed a point-of-use fluoride 
detector using the colorimetric enzyme, catechol (2,3)-dioxygenase 
(C23DO) that is controlled by a riboswitch in the lyophilized E. coli CFS 
[116]. Growing the CFS genetic circuitry tool-box, this group high­
lighted the fluoride-responsive Bacillus cereus riboswitch that regulates 
the expression of a fluoride efflux pump in its native state, initially 
studied in 2016 for compatibility with the E. coli system [116]. Since 
riboswitches have short timescales of their regulatory decision making, 
they can often show weak activation of the substrate or protein, thus 
needing an amplifying output signal like C23DO which oxidizes a 
colorless substrate (catechol) to a yellow product (2-hydroxymuconate 
semialdehyde) (Fig. 2D2). Also, small amounts of fluoride (100 µM, the 
maximum containment amount set by the EPA) took longer to generate a 
signal, inaccurate regulation of the reporter protein was an issue. 
Therefore, they decided to constrain the testing window to 100 min, 
increase the concentration of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) to 10 nM, 
and increase the incubation temperature to 37 ◦C. They found that 
lyophilization helped to suppress leaks. Many point-of-use sensors used 
in the field encounter “matrix effects” caused by components in the 
environmental sample that could impede gene translation in the CFS. 
This fluoride detection platform proved to be robust against matrix ef­
fects, with all samples across a variety of water sources were able to 
activate a very similar color when the same concentration of fluoride 
was used [116]. 
Jung et al. combined sensing various water contaminants into a 
single robust and rapid platform, ROSALIND: RNA Output Sensors 
Activated by Ligand Induction [119]. This technology detects water 
contaminants by using an allosteric transcription factor (aTF) to bind to 
the water contaminants. The aTF and the water contaminant binding 
hinders aTF binding to its cognate operator sequence, allowing the 
transcription of the following RNA aptamer in the E. coli CFS (but only 
for transcription). The RNA aptamer was the three-way junction dimeric 
Broccoli (3WJdB) aptamer, which generates a loud signal, faster than 
translating a fluorescent or colorimetric protein (Fig. 2D3). After opti­
mizing the location of the operator, they found they could switch the 
operator sequence out to use different aTFs which would allow a wider 
variety of testing. To detect antibiotics, Jung et al. used the transcription 
factor TetR for tetracycline and doxycycline, OtrR for oxytetracycline, 
CtcS for chlortetracycline, and MphR for erythromycin, azithromycin, 
clarithromycin, and roxithromycin. ROSALIND was also able to detect 
small molecules, such as MobR to detect the perfume additive 3-hydrox­
ybenzoic acid and QacR to detect the disinfectant benzalkonium chlo­
ride. This system could also detect heavy metals, using SmtB to detect 
zinc, CsoR to detect copper, CadC for lead and cadmium [119]. ROSA­
LIND also exhibited low crosstalk, except for when CsoR aTF was used 
which also generated signal when in the presence of zinc, so they 
designed an AND NOT logic gate. When zinc binds to the wrong aTF, 
CsoR will also bind to its correct aTF, SmtB, which then activates the 
expression of an RNA kleptamer, KB2. KBR then disrupts the aptamer 
folding (expressed by the incorrect binding to CsoR), decreasing its 
signal [154]. Another problem the researchers ran in was lowering the 
limit of detection (LOD) for some of their contaminant detection to 
receive a positive result after a molecule had just crossed the EPA’s 
maximum limit. The CsoR aTFs to detect copper respond to an amount 
too low and CadC for lead responds to an amount too high. Therefore, 
they desensitized CsoR by increasing its concentration more than the 
concentration of the available DNA/operators to initiate cleating effects. 
To increase the signal from CadC, they tried decreasing its concentra­
tion, so more repressors were de-activated and not just chelating, but 
this caused an increased background signal because there were some 
operators left unbound. Instead of decreasing the aTF concentration, 
they decided to add a feedback loop to the circuit, so that when TetR 
de-represses in the presence of doxycycline, it expresses the Broccoli 
RNA aptamer and a TetR-binding aptamer, which then de-represses 
other TetR repressors. After optimizing their system, they were able to 
lyophilize and ship it at ambient temperatures to many areas to test the 
municipal water supply efficiently but ran into some matrix effects when 
testing on environmental water supplies [119]. 
Liu et al. designed a field-deployable cell-free biosensor to detect 
cyanuric acid, however noticed how both whole-cell and cell-free bio­
sensors can be unpredictable at times during design and testing, often 
requiring heavy optimization [117]. Specifically, here they used an 
allosteric transcription factor (aTF) for the core of their biosensor, which 
interacts with its cognate promoter when its ligand is present, but this 
interaction is not always that straight forward, therefore, making the 
user encounter unsuspected issues when trying to use the bioregulation 
in a nonnative host. Therefore, when choosing which aTF to use in the 
nonnative host E. coli, they chose a LysR-type transcription regulator 
(LTTR) because it is among the largest families of aTR, thus allowing 
other researchers to use the same design principles when working with 
other LTTRs. For this aTF, AtzR, they first designed and compared a li­
brary of hybrid promoters (partially the atzDEF promoter and partially 
the E. coli σ70 promoter). After finding the design rules regarding LTTRs 
used in E. coli, without disrupting the native binding sites of the 
repressor, they were able to have high expression and ligand-responsive 
activation in E. coli. They also found that there were some differences in 
expressing this sensor system in whole-cell (WC) versus cell-free (CF), 
even though the dose-response curve was about the same, including: CF 
hits saturation regime at lower concentrations, CF had higher activation 
ratios because it had a lower leak, etc. When the CF detection was used 
with natural water samples, it could sense cyanuric acid at relevant 
concentrations within an hour. Most importantly, it was able to detect 
chlorine levels in swimming pools without being inhibited by matrix 
effects. 
Based on the cyanic acid detection, Silverman et al. integrated

metabolic pathways with biosensing to convert manmade chemicals (e. 
g., pesticides), that are not detectable by many natural transcription 
factors yet so that they could be turned into a molecule that could be 
accurately measured in the CFS [118]. In this study, Silverman et al. 
designed an atrazine sensor using a three-enzyme cascade from the 
strain ADP-1 of Pseudomonas sp. for metabolizing the atrazine into the 
cyanuric acid (Fig. 2D1). The transcription factor and each enzyme were 
expressed in separate cells and then turned into the cell extracts 
(pre-enriched extracts), to be reassembled later with a blank cell-extract 
to create an enzyme cascade and protein expression system. This tech­
nique will be described more in Section 3 of this review paper and can be 
visualized in Fig. 3 [103]. Once all the pre-enriched extracts with the 
metabolic enzymes and transcription factors were mixed with DNA 
encoding sfGFP controlled by the ADP-1 atzR promoter, they were able 
to detect atrazine at 100 µM. The sensor had high specificity as well, 
with only a weak activation with the most structurally similar com­
pound chemically. Since the pre-enriched extracts had lower protein 
synthesis than the blank extract, they adjusted ratios to increase the 
activity of the sensor, while still trying to maximize sensitivity and 
reduce false positives. Although they were not able to detect the 
maximum limit of atrazine, 3 ppb, set by the EPA, they were still able to 
report the most sensitive sensor compared to other whole-cell atrazine 
sensors. Some of the constraints for reaching a lower limit of detection 
(LOD) are caused by the transcription factor’s affinity for cyanuric acid 
and the affinity for atrazine by the first enzyme in the metabolic path­
ways [118]. 
2.4. Protein biomarker 
In 2019, Byun et al. created an ultrasensitive expression immuno­
assay using the E. coli CFS that was able to reach a LOD 120-fold lower 
than previous reports in this same category, detecting levels of the he­
patocellular carcinoma biomarker protein, α-fetoprotein (AFP), as low 
as 7 fM [121]. The first immunoassay was known as the enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay (ELISA), which was widely used and still is today, 
but its limit of detection cannot be brought down to diagnosis levels of 
some early diseases due to loss in sensitivity [155,156]. Therefore, 
methods were created that linked a DNA template to the detection 
antibody that would encode a reporter enzyme, so many more enzymes 
could be created than what was conjugated to the antibodies in ELISA 
assays [157]. The study that Byun et al. based theirs off detected a 
prostate-specific antigen with an antibody conjugated to DNA encoding 
firefly luciferase (FLuc) using the rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL)-based 
CFS to synthesize the FLuc [158]. This lysate is not as robust as the E. coli 
lysate at synthesizing proteins and much more complicated to make, so 
the Byun et al. made a less-complicated lysate that was able to synthe­
size 6-fold more of FLuc with their easier to make lysate (Fig. 2C) [121]. 
Also, by optimizing the temperature and magnesium levels in the E. coli 
CFS, they were able to obtain a large amount of soluble and active FLuc. 
Interestingly, when they attempted to increase the solubility and func­
tion by adding the chaperones GroEL/ES, they had an increase in solu­
bility but observed a decrease in activity compared to the standard 
extract. When AFP was diluted in human serum, their methods were able 
to reach a LOD of 290 fM. Although this method is highly sensitive and 
affordable, the system does take about 4 h longer than the traditional 
ELISA methods for sensing the same target. Tuning reaction conditions 
could expedite the reaction and improve the conjugation of DNA to the 
antibody to add more templates and greatly improve this detection 
method in the future [121]. 
Inspired by the decoding of the human genome, Ohashi and 
Miyamoto-Sato developed a simple in vitro virus (IVV) selection system 
concept to improve individually-targeted healthcare [159]. It uses 
cell-free co-translation to provide a comprehensive analysis of proteins 
and protein-ligand interactions to elucidate what is occurring after 
mutations in genes that cause disease states (Fig. 2E). Current whole-cell 
methods for studying protein-protein interactions such as the yeast 
two-hybrid [160] and affinity purification-mass spectrometry [161] 
have significant false positives and false-negative signals. This alterna­
tive IVV technology aims to relieve these problems since the CFS would 
allow for a higher data acquisition compared to the whole-cell methods, 
further determining if the signal is true or not. The IVV system involves 
the covalent binding of mRNA, and subsequently, the protein encoded 
by the mRNA, by puromycin in the cell-free translation system [159, 
162]. Puromycin can bind to the mRNA 3′-end as well as the C-terminal 
end of the encoded protein by inserting itself into the A site of the 
ribosome [163]. Puromycin also serves as an efficient labeling method 
for proteins. The proteins of interest can then be captured and purified 
by affinity beads. After purification, the mRNA can be amplified with 
reverse transcription PCR by two different primers. One primer is used 
to create cDNA for the next round of proteins for selection and the other 
primer containing a barcoded region is used for high-throughput 
sequencing. The reads are then sorted by barcoded regions which 
reduce the risk of cross-contamination of libraries [159]. 
Monitoring small organisms that infect the body is difficult due to 
their size, however, when they reside in a delicate place like the lungs, it 
is even more challenging and costly. Wen et al. overcame this moni­
toring barrier by developing a quorum-sensing sensor using the CFS to 
detect small extracellular molecules made by the pathogen Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa, most commonly known to infect cystic fibrosis patients 
[122]. Specifically, they monitored acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs), 
allowing P. aeruginosa cells to communicate with each other. They chose 
to detect the molecules with a partner transcription factor, choosing one 
that could detect the AHL and 3OC12-HSL (Hormone-Sensitive Lipase)

neering: the crude-extract system and the purified enzyme system.

levels that were clinically relevant while still providing a substantial 
output, which they found to be LasRV [102]. They detected 3OC12-HSL 
from sputum samples, purified and concentrated them using an organic 
solvent, and then collected aliquots for the CFS and liquid 
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry for parallel quantification. 
They chose the E. coli Rosetta strain for the extract to obtain a brighter 
fluorescent output of sfGFP when compared to others to achieve a 
clinically relevant LOD [122]. Allowing a signal in as early as 2.5 h, this 
CFS sensor displays a sensitive, accurate, and robust technology to 
monitor lung infections caused by P. aeruginosa. 
2.5. Low-cost quantitative sensing from a blood drop 
Creating a low-cost sensing platform that can generate a readout 
from a small amount of blood is a dream many diagnostic researchers 
strive to fabricate into reality. Unfortunately, this can be a daunting task 
with the background noise in the blood, low target analyte concentra­
tion, and inefficient systems to properly give trustworthy output signals. 
The field has also been tainted by scam companies such as Theranos, 
which gave so many false-promises [164]. Hopefully, with the power 
and capabilities of the CFS, researchers developing drop-of-blood sen­
sors can gain back the trust of the public and investors. This advanced 
sensing platform is what McNerney and others in the Styczynski Lab are 
striving to create with cell-free expression (CFE) systems while giving a 
quantitative readout for biomarkers other than nucleic acids [115]. In 
their platform, they detected zinc by expressing a zinc-responsive acti­
vator, which, when zinc was present in concentrations of 0–20 µM, 
could bind to the activator and turn on the reporter protein, β-galacto­
sidase with the substrate chlorophenol red (CPR)–β-D-galactopyrano­
side (CPRG), instead of a fluorescent reporter (Fig. 2D2). To increase 
their output signal, they could consider adopting the split LacZ created 
by Ma and others [112] in the future. McNerney et al. applied the 
lyophilizing system here for point-of-care purposes. To avoid the serum 
sample matrix impact that can affect robustness and quantification, they 
use the patient’s sample for parallel calibration standards. Due to the 
possibility of distorting the output color range caused by the red blood 
cells, the patient would simply add the blood sample to the test reaction 
and a set of standard reactions to identify the zinc using the different 
levels of ZntR transcriptional regulator. Their range of zinc detection in 
25% serum is within the range of identifying a zinc deficiency, dis­
tinguishing 4 µM increments between 0 and 20 µM, with just a finger 
prick of blood. They could also translate this platform to detect nucleic 
acids [115]. This research brings the biosensing field one step closer to 
at-home biosensing without expensive laboratory panels, making 
healthcare accessible to so many more people. 
After publishing the CFE-based zinc serum sensor, McNerney et al. 
published a whole-cell-based serum zinc sensor [165]. They switched to 
whole-cells to create a more complex sensor, incorporating difficult 
metabolic pathways to produce more distinguishable pigments for the 
quantification without a detector. Although this work is a whole-based 
sensor, it is hard to omit the mention of this interesting low-cost incu­
bation method in this review – attaching the tube of the whole-cell 
circuit to the user’s stomach. In addition, McNerney et al. published a 
paper showing how whole-cell systems were better for sensing B12 levels 
close to clinical levels than CFS, probably due to whole cells’ membrane 
transporters being able to concentrate the B12. They mentioned that 
implementing encapsulation techniques could allow CFS to use mem­
brane transporters to concentrate compounds of interest [166]. Adding 
encapsulated CFSs to the gene circuit sensor toolbox could also allow the 
sensor to signal at only specific concentration thresholds. Another group 
has tried to encapsulate the CFS containing genetic circuitry with a lipid 
bilayer and was able to construct artificial cells that could sense osmotic 
pressure and external calcium concentration [57]. 
3. Drug production 
3.1. Cell-free metabolic engineering for medicine 
50% of the drugs currently used today were invented during the 
discovery age of antibiotics from 1950 to 1960 [167]. Since then, anti­
microbial drug discovery has seen a massive decline with only about 30 
new antibiotics being approved in the last 20 years. The current drug 
discovery rate cannot keep up with the climbing number of microbes 
obtaining multidrug-resistance [168]. In order to alleviate this polari­
zation [169], a robust drug discovery technology is highly demanded. 
The CFS can serve as that technology by offering a rapid 
design-build-test pipeline for the biomanufacturing of various protei­
nous and non-proteinous molecules, and easy manipulation of multiple 
biosynthetic pathways. The cell-free metabolic engineering (CFME) of­
fers an alternative way to manipulate the complex cellular network 
outside the living cell (Fig. 3) [129]. The control that comes with the 
CFME platform allows for measurement of metabolic fluxes in multistep 
pathways, the effects of redox potential on pathways’ performances, 
isolate parameters that are difficult with in vivo systems, and the ability 
to study the actions and stability of enzymes of interest [170]. 
Recently, 50% of pharmaceutical products have been derived from 
natural products and their derivatives [171]. The most common way to 
obtain medicinal products is to extract them directly from their pro­
ducers, such as plants and bacteria. This method is no longer the most 
efficient due to its low productivity, high-costs, unsustainability, and 
harm to the environment compared to new molecular engineering 
methods [172]. Other approaches that have shown burdens include 
chemical synthesis which cannot produce the chemicals’ structural 
complexity and in vivo synthesis from E. coli and S. cerevisiae which 
shows problems obtaining high yields due to toxic byproducts along 
with a lack of necessary precursors, folding chaperones, and 
post-translational enzymes [172,173]. To avoid these issues, scientists 
have been testing the production of pharmaceuticals stemming from 
natural products via in vitro metabolic engineering by the reconstitution 
of biosynthetic pathways. 
There are two main systems commonly used for natural product 
synthesis: the crude cell-extract system and the purified enzyme system 
(Fig. 3; Table 1) [129,174]. Examples of using in vitro purified enzyme 
systems to synthesize natural products include the assembly of poly­
ketides (PKs) and nonribosomal peptides (NRPs) [172,175]. A promi­
nent PK assembly line is the deoxyerythronolide B synthase (DEBS) 
which synthesizes 6-deoxyerythronolide B (6-dEB), an ingredient for 
erythromycin antibiotics [176,177]. Three multienzymes polypeptide 
enzymes make up DEBS: DEBS1, DEBS2, and DEBS3 [178]. The DEBS 
enzymes were heterologously expressed using the E. coli BAP1 strain 
engineered to express the PPtase sfp gene for post-translational modifi­
cation of the enzymes. DEBS2 and DEBS3 were easily expressed and 
purified in this strain whereas DEBS1 showed low yield [175]. To 
enhance the DEBS1 production rate, Lowry et al. split the DEBS1 gene 
into three fragments to express three smaller polypeptides. As a result,

all five purified components (DEBS2, DEBS3, and three polypeptides of 
DEBS1) can be mixed with additional substrates for in vitro reconstitu­
tion. This method is also useful when one byproduct of an enzyme is 
inhibitory to another enzyme that is essential for the synthesis of the 
product, as is the case for the synthesis for the polyketide antibiotic 
enterocin from a PKs pathway. Lowry et al. integrated two in vitro re­
action steps to resolve it. The first eight enzymes were synthesized in a 
single-pot reaction to obtain the intermediates and the key precursor 
(5-deoxyenterocin). The extracted 5-deoxyenterocin was introduced to 
the final EncR-catalyzed reaction in the following step, which yielded 
the final product, the enterocin. 
The other in vitro crude-extract option for synthesizing natural 
products involves utilizing the CFPS system. Two nonribosomal peptide 
synthetases (NRPS), GrsA and GrsB1, were expressed using the CFPS 
platform [179]. Producing GrsA and GrsB1 is the first step to synthe­
sizing gramicidin S, a nonribosomal cyclodecapeptide antibiotic, by 
creating D-Phe-L-Pro-diketopiperazine (DKP) through intramolecular 
cyclization. Cell-free co-expression of GrsA and GrsB with a partial NRPS 
in vitro assembly line, D-Phe-L-Pro DKP could be produced at a higher 
yield (12 mg/L) than in vivo synthesis (9 mg/L) [179]. 
More recently, Dudley et al. exhibited the flexibility of crude lysates 
to sustain complex metabolism with a glucose-to-limonene pathway 
conducted by a mix of seven enzyme-enriched lysates carrying out 20 
biosynthetic steps with 9 heterologous enzyme steps [170]. Limonene is 
a type of monoterpenoid and serves as a precursor for medicines as well 
as insecticides and biofuels [180]. Limonene has been successfully 
synthesized in various bacterial hosts such as E. coli [181], yeast [182], 
and cyanobacteria [181], but the titers have been low and there was 
high toxicity which conflicted with prototyping of highly active en­
zymes. Their CFME platform was able to generate 0.66 mM (90.2 mg/L) 
limonene over 24 h with the productivity of 3.8 mg/L/h [170]. 
Although they did not exhibit a productivity level comparable to in vivo 
systems directly (8.4 mg/L/h) [183], they demonstrated that the ad­
vantages of the CFME platform over in vivo system such as 1) lowering 
wait time between experiments since it does not require DNA manipu­
lation to balance pathway flux and 2) the tuning of promoters and 
ribosome binding sites, or complicated product extractions. They were 
also able to sustain adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production and higher 
limonene production by tuning the cofactor after identifying a 
competing byproduct pathway [170]. Since the CFS does not require 
reengineering an organism for each pathway iteration, they hope that 
the platform can serve as a method for prototyping enzymatic mono­
terpenoid pathways. In addition, this system has fewer toxicity con­
straints, making it well suited for the production of a natural product or 
antimicrobial peptide synthesis [170]. 
Tackling the problem of worldwide antibiotic resistance, Zhuang 
et al. utilized the CFS to synthesize the antibiotic valinomycin and 
showed an accelerated approach for antibiotic discovery and synthesis 
[78]. The valinomycin synthetase is associated with a 36-membered 
cyclododecadepsipeptide, with two NRPSs totaling 654 kDa. The team 
decided to use both the crude cell-extract system and the purified 
enzyme system by either coexpressing the two NRPSs in the CFS or 
enriching extracts with either one of the NRPSs and then allowing the 
metabolic pathway for valinomycin assembly to occur in the CFS. 
Expressing both NRPSs in vitro with the NRPS protein helper protein 
known as type II thioesterase (TEII) (expressed in vitro as well) yielded 
37.11 μg/L while the enriched extract method, after optimization, was 
able to reach 30 mg/L. After successfully creating enriched extracts from 
enzymes synthesized separately in vivo, they optimized the CFME reac­
tion subsequently by removing the cofactors coenzyme A (CoA), nico­
tinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), and ATP, spiking in 200 mM 
glucose, expressing TEII, and optimizing the ratio of the two enriched 
extracts [78]. Overall, this method of producing valinomycin serves as 
an easily tunable, high titer yielding, fast, and low-maintenance option 
compared to the whole cell. 
3.2. Virus-like particles for vaccines and vaccine screening 
The E. coli CFS was first used to synthesize virus-like particles (VLPs) 
in the Swartz group in 2008 [184] and has only improved since then 
[133,185] (Table 2). VLPs are nanostructures composed of some or all of 
the viral capsid but lack the viral genomic material making them much 
safer during testing, manufacturing, and administration of vaccines 
[186]. Their repetitive subunits trigger a high immune response. Many 
VLP-based vaccines are already used in the clinics, including two tar­
geting hepatitis B: GlaxoSmithKline’s Engerix® (made in whole-cell) 
and Merck and Co., Inc.’s Recombivax HB® (made in whole-cell 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae and FDA approved); and two targeting human 
papillomavirus (HPV) both FDA approved: Cervarix® (made in insect 
cells-baculovirus system) and Gardasil® (made in S. cerevisiae), while 
others are in clinical trials [187]. The interest in VLPs has also increased 
significantly over the few years spurring many innovative ideas in 
research for new uses and more efficient production [186]. 
Although VLPs were first made popular in many different types of 
whole-cell systems, the production suffered from not being able to 
control the environment enough to get a large amount of quality VLPs 
and toxicity from the production on cell growth [184]. The CFS relieved 
these limitations and further enhanced production in various ways 
including adding protein conjugated to the capsid [187], scalability 
while maintaining reproducibility (which is something in vivo suffered 
from especially when disassembly and reassembly are required), 
single-step purification, less contamination and reduced need for as­
sembly and reassembly because the system is much more dilute, and the 
focus of metabolic resources toward the transcription and translation of 
the capsids [184]. 
Bundy and Swartz conquered one of the weaknesses of synthesizing 
VLPs in the CFS, which was the formation of highly structured viral 
capsids in their second VLP project in 2011 [185]. This research was 
important because some of the most robust viruses have highly struc­
tured capsid shells like human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [188], 
Hepatitis B [189], Hepatitis C [190], and Polyomavirus [191] and QBeta 
phage [192]. They efficiently created disulfide bonds in three VLPs by 
forming mimicked environments closer to the viral capsids’ natural 
environments during its formation. Naturally, the virus capsids are 
assembled in the reductive cytosol of the cells and then form disulfide 
bonds in the oxidative environment of the endoplasmic reticulum or the 
extracellular environment if the cell bursts. To form the disulfide bonds, 
they assembled the VLPs in a normal reductive CFS environment, puri­
fied, and then exposed them to an oxidizing environment using diamide 
[185]. They also compared their native viral capsids’ environment 
system to previously established modifications in the CFPS reaction for 
creating disulfide bond formation [193,194] and found benefits and 
disadvantages for both. The unnatural oxidation environment was best 
for the formation of disulfide bonds in Hepatitis B core antigen VLP,

forming all of them essentially, as opposed to mimicking the native 
formation environment which was only 20% efficient. There was also 
limited success in efficiently forming the disulfide bonds in MS2 
bacteriophage VLP. The Qβ VLP formed disulfide bonds at 
high-efficiency levels in the simulated native viral capsids assembly and 
maturation pathway. Ultimately, they found that the optimal conditions 
for disulfide bond formation are dependent on the type of VLP. 
The Swartz group continuously published VLPs papers regarding 
increasing the innate immune response by adding flagellin to hepatitis B 
core protein (HBc) VLPs [195] and by improving stability, lowering 
intrinsic immunogenicity and antigenicity, and allowing the surface of 
VLPs to mimic natural viruses for the HBc VLPs. First, the flagellin ac­
tivates the immune response because it is a natural agonist of the human 
toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5). It has been expressed in vivo before, but it is 
hard to express and is highly unstable. Using the CFS allowed for proper 
tuning of the flagellin to avoid proteolytic degradation by adding pro­
tease inhibitors to the C-terminal and intrinsic disulfide bonds to the first 
domain near the C-terminal to provide more structure. They also added 
numerous flagellin on the surface of the VLP using click chemistry but 
found that adding only 2 gave the same response as adding 33 did, 
displaying the strong affinity for TLR5 [195]. 
Lu et al. also improved the HBc VLPs by addressing issues that occur 
during phase III clinical trials of the vaccine which included instability, 
poor fusion of core proteins and antigens, and immunogenicity [196]. 
They first sought to stabilize the VLPs structure by creating more di­
sulfide bonds containing mutant VLPs, which improved stability 
tremendously in various conditions compared to the non-mutated VLPs. 
They were also successful in conjugating flagellin and gran­
ulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GMCSF) to the VLPs by 
using Cu(I)-catalyzed [3 + 2] cycloaddition click chemistry by taking 
advantage of the site-specific incorporation of non-standard amino acids 
in the CFS. Lu et al. noticed the highly negative charge of the VLP surface 
repelled a vaccine antigen and an innate immunity stimulator from 
conjugating, so they decreased the number of negative charges on the 
VLP surface, but could not remove the charges at the spike tips of the 
VLPs otherwise they would lose stability [196]. After mutating the VLP 
to reduce negative charges, they dialyzed VLP in high ionic strength 
buffer to maintain the stability of the particle, which also allowed to 
retain the conjugation of flagellin and GMCSF. They found that the 
antibody C1–5 could not recognize the HBc VLP mutant SS1(HP) 
78AHA, thus confirming HBc specific antibodies already present in the 
patients should not interfere with that VLP. To confer a weak or small 
immune response upon vaccination, the immunogenicity of the VLP 
should be low. With their modified HBc VLPs, they detected low levels of 
anti-VLP (which did not rise with repeated inoculations) and low T-cell 
response, with the lowest being that of the mutant SS1(HP) 78AHA-HPG 
HBc VLP, making it a great candidate for a low immunogenicity vaccine 
or drug delivery vehicle [196]. This research offers great ideas to 
improve VLPs for therapeutics and vaccine production. So far, VLPs have 
been made using the CFS to assemble the capsid protein of B-cell lym­
phoma vaccine, human papillomavirus 58 (HPV58) L1 [197], MS2 
bacteriophage [184], H1N1 influenza [198], hepatitis B core protein 
(HBc) variants, and the truncated capsid of Hepatitis B [184] (Table 2). 
VLPs can also be used as targeted drug delivery vehicles [199], biolog­
ical imagining agents [200], and catalysts [196]. 
The CFS has also been used to screen for mutations in parasites, 
which helps to show when vaccines or therapeutics are no longer 
effective [94]. In 2015, 214 million cases and 438,000 deaths due to 
malaria were reported, with the Plasmodium falciparum strain causing 
most of the problems [201]. The vaccines to combat malaria are limited 
in clinical and preclinical development [201]. This is a problem in the 
fight to control malaria considering the high-rate emergence of 
drug-resistant parasites and insecticide-resistant mosquitoes. Some of 
the vaccines that have made it to field studies or controlled human 
malaria infection models become outdated and, therefore, ineffective, 
due to the time it takes to screen, produce, and test the vaccines. 
Screening proteins for novel vaccine candidates can run into issues due 
to difficulties in expressing plasmodial proteins in expression systems, 
leading to them not being able to elicit functional antibodies. Thus, 
Morita et al. generated a large P. falciparum protein library containing a 
total of 1827 recombinant proteins, covering most of the parasite’s 
proteome, all proteins were tagged with biotin and synthesized using the 
wheat-germ based CFS [94]. Next, the library was screened using the 
AlphaScreen program, with antibodies from subjects who had acquired 
antibody response due to repeated malaria infections [202]. They 
detected immunoreactivity in about half (891 out of 1827) of the pro­
teins screened, a higher number than previous studies most likely due to 
the advantage of the conformation of proteins in the wheat-germ-based 
CFS. They were able to narrow down one protein with an 
antigen-specific antibody response and a positive growth inhibition 
assay. LSA3-C, whose gene sequence is highly conserved in P. falciparum 
isolates from diverse geographical areas [203]. Through their studies, 
they were able to identify the most effective novel blood-stage vaccine 
candidate, LSA3 protein [94]. 
3.3. Therapeutics 
The CFS has also become popular to produce antibodies for thera­
peutic purposes (Table 3). The production of fully soluble, non- 
aggregated, correctly folded antigen-binding fragments (Fabs), engi­
neered single-chain antibody variable fragments (scFvs), and aglycosy­
lated full-length antibodies (IgGs) has been done by Yin and coworkers 
(Fig. 4A) [69]. Regarding the synthesis of eukaryotic proteins such as 
Fabs and IgGs in the E. coli systems, Yin et al. optimized the production 
by adding meticulous heterodimer assembly and a rapid ribosomal 
translation-elongation rate resulting in fully soluble, correctly folded, 
multi-domain proteins with up to 16 disulfide bonds lacking any trun­
cated or aggregated products [69]. Then, Groff and coworkers found 
that chaperones FkpA and DsbC synergistically help to fold IgG, so they 
engineered E. coli strains to overexpress the chaperones to then prepared 
cell extract and use it in for the system synthesizing the IgG [204]. 
Another multi-disulfide-bonded cytokine known as the gran­
ulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rhGM-CSF) was syn­
thesized by Zawada and coworkers in a linear scalable manner achieving 
yields of 700 mg/L in 10 h over ~ 106 range in volumes to 100 L [205]. 
Even complex bispecific antibodies, which are single antibodies that can 
recognize two targets, have been made using the E. coli CFS (Fig. 4C) 
[71]. Shirouzu group also found DsbC to be crucial in the synthesis of 
functional antibody fragments in the E. coli CFS. They also found the 
dialysis mode CFS to be very powerful in producing antibody fragments 
for the structural analysis of the antibody in complex with human 
epidermal growth factor receptor—extracellular domain (EGFR-ECD) 
[70]. Understanding more of the antibody-antigen structure can lead to 
improved affinity and thus enhanced antibody treatments [206]. 
Zimmerman et al. created a means for producing antibody-drug 
conjugates (ADCs), a new oncological innovation which combines a 
small chemotherapeutic molecule with a tumor antigen-specific anti­
body to form a targeted therapy, through CFPS featuring non-standard 
amino

[72]. This allowed for homogenous ADC production with a drug to 
antibody ratio (DAR) values approaching two drugs per antibody that 
are potent when evaluated in in vitro cytotoxicity assays. Effective ADC’s 
can then be rapidly produced in small to large scales and could also yield 
more active and diverse drug products to be used in the targeted delivery 
of potent cytotoxins [72]. 
Stafford et al. used the CFS to screen IgGs for the high-specific 
binding capacity to carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), CEA positive 
cells, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) [93]. Using this 
method in a CFPS platform, they were able to display Fab, the 
antigen-binding fragment of an antibody, from ribosomes and select it 
using the HER2/ErbB2 extracellular domains in a cell-free reaction. The 
main feature of their system is the use of Fabs, which can be selected via 
ribosome display to find binders to carcinoembryonic antigen and 
vascular endothelial growth factor, and they can also be reformatted 
into IgGs and screened rapidly in vitro. By combining the Fab display and 
CFS platform, they created a means to rapidly discover lead IgG’s from 
larger libraries of Fabs than is possible with other selection technologies. 
This novel platform allows for the rapid discovery of synthetic or natural 
antibodies [93]. 
In contrary to whole-cell methods, the CFS has been shown to express 
a soluble, bioactive granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) 
triple-His variant protein discovered by Heinzelman and others [77]. 
This protein has been observed to protect neurons from apoptosis and 
promote differentiation of neural stem cells in vitro [76]. It has been 
prescribed to treat neutropenia, and hopefully, Alzheimer’s [207], 
Parkinson’s [208], and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis [209] in the 
future. Zhao et al. screened G-CSFs to enhance the penetration activity 
through the blood brain barrier (BBB) and hopefully increase the ther­
apeutic response [210]. They expressed mutated versions of G-CSF 
under oxidizing conditions with the chaperone protein DsbC in an E. coli 
CFS, which doubled the soluble yield compared to CFS under reducing 
conditions. Mutant G-CSFs have validated the receptor binding activity 
using surface plasmon resonance. They found that the triple histidine 
variant created pH responsiveness, possibly capable of inducing trans­
cytosis across the BBB mediated by the G-CSF receptor (G-CSFR). The pH 
responsiveness could reduce the G-CSF binding affinity to the receptor 
after endocytosis without compromising the affinity on the cell’s exte­
rior. The histidine side chain has a pKa of ~ 6.0, so it would create 
electrostatic repulsion of G-CSF/G-CSFR binding interfaces once intro­
duced into the endosome with an acidic pH of 5.5–6.0 [77]. The CFS’s 
open nature allows for this meticulous tuning of protein synthesis for 
microscopical, but crucially important, biological reactions of 
therapeutics. 
Salehi et al. utilized an E. coli-based CFS for synthesizing the cyto­
toxic protein onconase, a ribonuclease that could be used to treat cancer 
due to its malignancy towards living cells (Fig. 5) [73]. Currently, the 
onconase is derived from the oocytes of the Northern Leopard Frog, 
which makes production much more expensive and laborious compared 
to heterologous expression in the host cell and CFS. Due to the CFS 
provides a less sensitive environment to cytotoxic elements, the system 
was suitable for highly soluble onconase production over E. coli 
whole-cell system. Another benefit of utilizing the CFS is the ability to 
form a stable lyophilized system, which will be discussed more in Sec­
tion 4. Salehi et al. took advantage of this unique feature to the 
on-demand onconase production, even in a “just add water” CFS, which 
they showed could be active for a full year when stored above −80 ◦C. 
This will allow for the rapid production of soluble, active proteins 
resulting in the medicine becoming more personal and on-demand [73, 
122]. Cai and colleagues produced another cancer therapeutic. They 
streamlined the expression protocol of the immunoglobulin G protein 
trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody, which is used as adjuvant therapy 
for HER2-positive breast cancer in an E. coli-based CFS [74]. With the 
overexpression of HER2 being present in 20–30% of breast cancer, the 
ability to quickly and efficiently express trastuzumab could be the key to 
effectively slowing cancer growth and proliferation in many patients. 
The main feature of this research is the development of a simplified CFPS 
reaction, which resulted in a 95% decrease in reagent costs without any 
loss in productivity. They also demonstrated that the simplified reaction 
could be integrated in a freezable master mix solution [74]. With the 
simplified experimental setting and the systems’ low production costs, 
therapeutic proteins, including trastuzumab and many others, could be 
produced more efficiently and cost-effectively. 
In the most recent cell-free healthcare news, the Bundy lab has been 
publishing a series of reports on a finely tuned on-demand treatment 
CFS-based platform for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. First, they 
created an endotoxin-free cell-extract using the previously genetically 
engineered lipopolysaccharide-free BL21 DE3 E. coli strain [211]. Next, 
they streamlined the preparation of the ClearColi extract to reduce the 
hands-on time requirement [212]. Then, they tested several combina­
tions of lyoprotectants to lyophilize the ClearColi extract-based thera­
peutic synthesis system to reduce protein aggregation and denaturation 
that can reduce the activity of the product and cause immunogenicity 
(explained in the Portability and Convenience section) [107]. Recently, 
they published reports on enhancing the CFS lymphoma therapeutic, 
crisantaspase, production and added an in-house CFS-based activity

assay to rapidly assess the activity of the produced crisantaspase in 
buffer, CFS, and human serum [75]. This latest work allows for the 
synthesis of the therapeutic while determining activity for dosage 
calculation and the ability to monitor the effectiveness during the 
treatment regimen, providing a well-rounded personalized on-demand 
treatment for acute lymphocytic leukemia patients [75]. 
Many recombinant protein therapeutics are produced in E. coli due to 
its low-cost nature and rapid growth kinetics [213]. Unfortunately, 
E. coli produce many endotoxins, or lipopolysaccharides, during growth 
and harvest which can activate a human immune response, sometimes 
resulting in septic shock [214,215]. The endotoxins can be removed by 
downstream purification to get to the acceptable purity, but this in­
creases costs with the additional steps making up 45–92% of total 
manufacturing costs [216]. Since the CFPS system uses pre-made cell 
extract, an opportunity for simple endotoxin removal presents itself 
before synthesis of the therapeutic, therefore removing the expensive 
post-synthesis purification step and the risk of disrupting or losing your 
therapeutic product during it. To do this, the Bundy lab prepared the 
first endotoxin-free cell-extract using the genetically engineered Clear­
Coli E. coli strain which modifies two of the lipid chains of the cell’s 
membrane that causes the endotoxin reaction in humans [211,214]. 
They compared this cell-extract performance with extract purified by 
two other commonly used endotoxin removal methods: Triton X-114 
two-phase extraction and polylysine affinity chromatography [211, 
217]. Even though Triton was more effective than chromatography by 
removing 95% of endotoxins while keeping 30% of protein synthesis 
activity, it still did not meet the FDA’s requirements of endotoxin levels 
since the amount is so great in a cell-extract setting [211]. After testing 
the Triton treated extract against the ClearColi extract with a LAL 
endotoxin reactivity assay, they found a ≈10–fold higher reduction of 
LAL reactivity in the product that was made with ClearColi extract. After 
optimization, the ClearColi extract was able to produce an amount of 
therapeutic enough for intravenous administration after one single af­
finity column purification in 8 h (1 mg/mL) while the Triton treated 
extract could not (0.45 mg/mL) [211]. 
After establishing that the genetically modified strain was superior 
for the production of their therapeutic protein, crisantaspase, the Bundy 
group streamlined the preparation process of making the cell extract to 
reduce the time and labor needed [212]. This was done by culturing the 
cells in an auto-induction media which automatically induces the 
expression of the robust T7 RNA polymerase while retaining the 
high-yield therapeutic and low endotoxin results in the subsequent 
synthesis procedure. They standardized the period of growth to harvest 
to remove repetitive monitoring of the optical density of the culture 
[212]. This is crucial for a slow-growing cell line like ClearColi, where 
the monitoring takes 12–18 h. They found that the window of time for 
harvest is between ~ 5.5 and 8 h after induction to retain the perfor­
mance of the extract. The combination of these two projects allows the 
preparation of endotoxin-free cell-extract to be inexpensive and pro­
vides a simple guide for many labs to carry out to reduce the shortage of 
drugs like crisantaspase, which was out of stock during the process of 
executing their cell-extract streamlining experiments [212]. To address 
the on-demand component of the crisantaspase production, the Bundy 
lab found the optimal lyoprotectants for packaging the system in a 
lyophilized setting (explained in detail in the Portability and Conve­
nience section in this review), showing a negligible loss in yield after 46 
days when stored in 4 ◦C, ~ 50% loss in 25 ◦C, and ~ 75% loss in 37 ◦C 
[107]. 
To understand their latest work, the science behind the most popular 
treatment method for acute lymphocytic leukemia must be briefly 
explained. Leukemic cells thrive when there are high levels of aspara­
gine in the body, so to combat the cells, the treatment is to administer a 
bacterial L-asparaginase (ASNase) known as colaspase to reduce the 
amount of exogenous asparagine [218]. Although, the combination of 
the short half-life of ASNase, thus frequent administration, with the 
patient developing antibodies against it, results in inactivation of the 
enzyme in 60% of cases [219]. When this happens, an Erwinia chrys­
anthemi derived ASNase known as crisantaspase is administered, but this 
can still trigger the body to create antibodies in 33% of cases without 
any symptoms [218]. This is why monitoring the circulating levels of 
ASNase is so important to make sure the treatment is not diminishing 
[220]. With this new study, the Bundy lab has improved the monitoring 
of ASNase levels by employing the CFS to create rapid, high-throughput, 
and low-cost assays [75]. They also improve upon their previous studies 
of using the CFS system to produce crisantaspase, increasing yields by 
72% [211]. This combination allows for the synthesis of therapeutics, 
the immediate assessment of the activity level for quality and dosage 
calculations, and the continuous monitoring of therapeutic effective­
ness, all in flexible storage and low-cost setting. The activity assay was 
designed based off of the fact that ASN metabolism directly impacts the 
crisantaspase expression yield [75]. The assay uses the CFS system’s 
ability to sense amino acids in the solution, so if ASNase is present when 
the patient’s serum is introduced to the assay, then the levels of ASN will 
decrease, thus lowering the amount of GFP reporter protein produced 
which needs ASN to be made [75]. Then to improve crisantaspase yields, 
they supplemented the protein synthesis reaction with asparagine at 
regular intervals, synthesizing enough crisantaspase for one child’s 
intravenous dose for treatment [75].

Back in 2015, Smith and others in the Bundy group also tried to 
reduce immune response triggers when creating therapeutics in the CFS 
and bacterial contamination by creating a completely “cell-free” system 
[221]. They noted that most cell-extracts are not completely free of 
whole cells and can have millions of residual cells per mL of extract. 
After testing lyophilization, sterile filtration, lysozyme methods, UV 
light decontamination, and antibiotics, they found that sterile filtration 
and lyophilization were the only methods to effectively decontaminate 
whole bacterial cells, but that sterile filtration resulted in the loss of 
activity of the extract [221]. 
Cancer therapeutics are not the only kind of therapeutics the Bundy 
lab is trying to create using the CFS, they also published their progress 
on synthesizing a therapeutic to treat ischemic stroke known as Tissue 
plasminogen activator (tPa) [76]. This is an FDA-approved drug but is 
currently costly for many who need it. Using the CFS to synthesize it 
could bring the price down, but it is a large protein with 17 disulfide 
bonds. To help fold the protein, they included 5 mM of glutathione 
buffer with a 4:1 ratio of oxidized and reduced glutathione plus 6.5 μM 
of DsbC to the CFS, allowing them to synthesize 104 μg/mL of full-length 
tPA protein because it was cleaved by serine proteases at 
non-glycosylated asparagines. The activity of their tPA was 
3000 μmol/min/mg, but unfortunately, that is less than 1% of the ac­
tivity of commercially available tPA. Although, any activity is a triumph 
for the CFS, and many optimizations can be done to increase this. Sur­
prisingly, they were able to use their synthesized tPA to lyse 30% of a 
blood clot overnight. Overall, this work shows very promising results for 
expressing complex, yet active therapeutic proteins in the CFS [76]. 
4. Portability and convenience 
Many drugs, vaccines, and other therapeutics require refrigeration 
during the entire distribution process, especially those that rely on living 
cells for production. Also, solution-phase reactions are not suitable for 
use out of a lab where environments could contaminate the reaction, or 
the reaction could misbehave. These requirements pose an unnecessary 
challenge now that cell-free synthetic biology has been introduced into 
healthcare, eradicating the high cost and complications of delicate 
storage needs. As shown in recent literature, on-demand therapeutic 
production and point-of-care services are becoming realistic with pro­
jects demonstrating lab-on-a-chip devices [105,106] as well as lyophi­
lizing the CFS (Table 4). Collins and his colleagues’ lyophilization works 
have shifted the general handling of the CFS and the applications [108, 
109]. Their works introduce the possibility of activating synthetic gene 
networks outside of a laboratory. What is also very compelling about 
these lyophilized CFS is that they could extend access to healthcare to 
remote communities, third-world countries, combat zones, and victims 
in natural disasters [222]. Pardee et al. demonstrated the toehold 
switch-regulated synthetic gene network biosensor on a paper-based 
CFS platform. One of the work’s highlights was that the CFPS activity 
remained after a year of storage in the lyophilized setting at room 
temperature [109]. The Freemont group has also employed lyophilized 
storage methods for CFSs. Their work focuses on detecting the Pseudo­
monas aeruginosa infection in cystic fibrosis patients by recognition of a 
pathogen-related quorum molecule, 3-oxo-C12-HSL [122]. Even in the 
lyophilized setting, they could detect the molecule at the nanomolar 
concentration quantitatively from a sample of the patient’s sputum. 
There has also been a portable illuminator and incubator device, The 
Fold-Illuminator, created to measure fluorescence sensitively and 
consistently qualitatively from CF biosensing reactions in a low-cost 
manner [223]. They were able to remove the reading variability 
caused by excitation light source, angle, intensity, and variability in 
ambient light. Designed from durable paper, replacement parts can 
easily be accessed, and repairs easily made. The price of the device 
comes to $5.58 and $9.56 for the added USB-powered incubation. When 
the device is paired with ImageJ software, it can create a quantitative 
measurement. 
As mentioned in the earlier section, the Bundy group previously 
demonstrated that the lyophilized CFS could produce a cytotoxic anti- 
cancer therapeutic onconase while retaining synthesis capabilities after 
a year in non-ideal storage conditions (Fig. 5) [73]. Recently, they tested 
lyoprotectants (D-(+)-trehalose dehydrate, dextran 70, Ficoll PM 70, 
maltitol, dimethylsulfoxide) to diminish the potential degradation and 
endure the CFS’s shelf life during lyophilization. The lyoprotectants 
were added to the cell-free reaction mixtures, frozen in a −40 ◦C ethanol 
bath, and lyophilized. To rehydrate the system, they calculated a rehy­
dration ratio with the initial and the dried sample weights to keep the 
protein concentrations consistent [107]. They found that the protein 
stability in the cell extract was not a major concern after analyzing the 
effect of the lyoprotectants on the activity of the cell extract and the 
CFPS performance. The extract has inherent lyoprotectant properties in 
a climate of 4 ◦C, but in climates of 37 ◦C and 50 ◦C, plasticized poly­
meric glass-based lyoprotectants could help to reduce degradation of 
extract due to molecular vibrations caused at these temperatures. In a 
higher temperature setting, they found that ficoll/maltitol/dimethyl 
sulfoxide (DMSO) mixture (FMD) was the preferred lyoprotectant. With 
the aid of lyoprotectant and the CFS optimization, a highly active tagless 
biosimilar version of FDA-approved crisantaspase could be produced 
using a single-pot, endotoxin-free lyophilized CFS system [107]. 
Gregorio et al. recently explored the impact of ten different additives 
(trehalose, maltose, lactose, raffinose, sucrose, trimethylglycine, carni­
tine, trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), polyethylene glycol (PEG) 8000, 
and polysorbate 20 (Tween 20)) for lyophilized cell extracts to increase 
the shelf life [224]. They first tested the effects of lyophilization alone on 
cell-extract stability which retained higher percentages of productivity 
compared to those in an aqueous phase when stored in 4 ◦C and 23 ◦C, 
but they both had a similar performance at −80 ◦C. Sugars can serve as a 
lyoprotectant and protein stabilizer for long-term protein storage [225, 
226]. When Gregorio et al. compared sugars as stabilizers, 30 mM 
trehalose showed the highest protein productivity after lyophilization 
and storage at all temperatures (−80 to 23 ◦C) with maltose and lactose 
close behind, showing no stability difference because of their 
non-reducing or reducing characteristics [224]. Although they have 
been known to inhibit the CFS at high concentrations, trimethylamine 
osmolytes were tested, which are naturally occurring stabilizers that 
protect organisms’ proteins under stress. [227]. Even though they 
naturally protect biomolecules in the cell, not all of them improved 
stability at a certain level, only carnitine (125 mM) slightly improved 
the protein synthesis when stored at −80 ◦C. However, trimethylamine 
N-oxide inhibited protein synthesis when stored at all temperatures. 
Surprisingly, trimethylglycine significantly enhanced protein stability 
higher than trehalose stored at −80 ◦C and 4 ◦C, but not 23 ◦C [224]. 
They also tested miscellaneous additives such as PEG 8000 and poly­
sorbate 20 (Tween 20). PEG has been shown to be a cryoprotectant, but

not a lyoprotectant [228], which shows why it did not improve stability 
much and decreased it when stored at 23 ◦C. Tween-20 slightly 
decreased protein synthesis after lyophilization and storage at all tem­
peratures, especially at −80 ◦C wither by autoxidation or general pro­
tein synthesis inhibition effects [224]. 
Recently, a portable, point-of-care proof of principle device has 
emerged that produces biologically derived medicines on-demand using 
the CFS. The Bio-MOD (biologically derived medicines on demand) 
device was designed by Adiga et al. for the battlefield [229]. It involves 
1) reliable hardware and software to compute the protein production 
necessities then automatically carries it out, 2) a lyophilized Chinese 
Hamster Ovary (CHO) CFS, 3) structurally and functionally identical 
protein synthesis to that produced by conventional in vivo methods, and 
4) versatility and flexibility to produce a variety of therapeutic proteins 
[229]. 
Microfluidic [230,231] and microreactor [232] array devices have 
been utilized for CFS and continuous exchange cell-free (CECF) protein 
synthesis. However, they have not been adequate for producing and 
purifying proteins at pharmaceutical levels [105]. That is until 2016 
when Sullivan et al. and Timm et al. started developing fluidic devices 
for rapid cell-free expression of therapeutic doses and purification of 
therapeutic proteins. Sullivan et al. created a fluid reactor suitable for 
CECF protein synthesis biologics [105]. The entire reactor supports the 
volume scale-up of the reaction and conducting the synthesis in batch 
mode when the dialysis membrane is removed. They demonstrated the 
protein synthesis capabilities of cell extracts from prokaryotic (E. coli) 
and eukaryotic (S. cerevisiae) organisms to produce recombinant human 
erythropoietin 
(rhEPO) 
and 
recombinant 
human 
gran­
ulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rhGM-CSF) [105]. 
Concerning rhEPO, the objective was to enhance the yields and 
bioactivity. To achieve the goals, they approached in two ways: 1) by 
employing the CECF to alleviate the exhaustion of essential substrates as 
well as to remove toxic byproducts [233] and 2) by adding mutations to 
either remove alternative initiation codons or decrease their use within 
natural EPO signal peptide sequences (portable peptides destined for a 
secretory pathway that are cleaved from the nascent polypeptide to 
reveal the mature protein), which eliminates translation initiation 
inhibitory factors that cause incorrect protein product due to ribosomal 
diversion [234,235]. As a result, 40 µg/mL of rhEPO protein was pro­
duced and showed sufficient bioactivity comparable to commercially 
available EPO protein [105]. Regarding rhGM-CSF, an optimization 
approach was taken to maximize the protein expression in its soluble 
(folding) form in a CFS system. To achieve this, several actions were 
taken: 1) relocation of the signal peptides, 2) the cell-free reaction 
occurred in an oxidizing environment with foldases and molecular 
chaperones that support disulfide bonds formation, and 3) the addition 
of the detergent Brij-35 that prevents aggregation and improves the 
solubility of proteins [233]. All the effort allowed for 2 mg/mL of 
rhGM-CSF synthesis, and the expressed protein was found to have 
bioactivity comparable to that of the commercially available hGM-CSF. 
In 2016, Timm et al. emphasized that approaches to synthesize 
therapeutic proteins using synthetic biology concepts failed to promptly 
create a therapeutic dose in a low-maintenance, low-cost fashion for the 
preparatory and processing steps. This was the driving reason why they 
created a dual-channel exchange microfluidic bioreactor platform to 
rapidly-produce therapeutic doses [106]. It was designed with three 
inlets feeding into a narrow-width channel with a serpentine pattern to 
fit a large portion of the glass slide. This design allows for efficient 
mixing with minimal shear-stress while still being able to achieve large 
volumes of protein despite the narrow-width [106]. The systems on this 
device can function in static mode, fed-batch mode with a continuous 
flow of dialysate through the feeder channel, or continuous-­
flow/continuous exchange mode. In addition, the modular fluidic 
scheme can be added to allow the continuously produced protein to be 
fed into a module for purification and/or concentration if desired. The 
protein yield (2 mg/mL of sfGFP) in this device was 6 times greater than 
that of a batch reaction of 15 µL. To further increase protein yield, they 
used small molecule exchange using tunable nanoporous membranes 
[106]. Although they only synthesized sfGFP, they anticipate that the 
flexibility of this technology’s design is ideal for creating personalized 
doses of therapeutic proteins of various types. 
Lastly, Jang in the Kim group created a rapid amino acid analysis test 
utilizing a well-known personal glucose monitor (PGM) by measuring 
glucose [113]. The reaction mix excluded the amino acid the assay was 
sensing so that when the amino acid was present, translation was able to 
continue to synthesize the reporter protein invertase. They mention that 
high concentrations of amino acids can correlate to metabolic diseases 
and even some types of cancer. They were able to analyze the amino acid 
range from 0.1 to 20 µM. The PGM offered rapid, accurate, and repro­
ducible outcomes, All data from this method was comparable to that 
obtained by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) [113]. 
They noted that some of the enzymes could interconvert amino acids, so 
both the target and the possible derivative should be removed from the 
reaction, or the protein synthesis using recombinant elements (PURE) 
CFS should be used to prevent potential amino acids interconverting 
[236]. 
5. Modeling and screening 
The rapid cell-free Design-Build-Test (DBT) pipeline in synthetic 
biology, in conjunction with the high-throughput computer-aid process, 
elevates the strain and pathway optimization process and allows it to be 
more predictable and efficient. Utilizing these technologies will decrease 
the number of strains needed to be engineered, increase the flexibility of 
biological processes to adapt to new markets, and expand the range of 
fossil-fuel and agriculturally derived products that can be made with 
bio-derived alternatives for an ecofriendly and economically efficient 
process [6]. High-throughput screening also allows for therapeutics to 
be made and tested quickly and in the most efficient method possible. 
Karim et al. proposed an in vitro Prototyping and Rapid Optimization 
of Biosynthetic Enzymes (iPROBE) for the prototyping of cell-like 
metabolic networks [6]. The approach of iPROBE is that the users can 
construct discrete enzymatic pathways by assembling modular cell ly­
sates that contain each necessary enzyme in vitro, instead of living or­
ganisms by stimulating the DBT cycle. The system consists of two swift 
steps: 1) enzyme synthesis via CFPS and 2) enzyme utilization via sub­
strate and cofactor addition. Separating the process into two steps allows 
for stoichiometric control of the enzyme amounts and reduces negative 
physiochemical effects on the CFS of the small molecules. They also 
created a pathway ranking system for iPROBE, called a TREE score 
(Titer, Rate, and Enzyme Expression), to assess the activity in the 
cell-free environment quantitatively. To demonstrate the platform, they 
tested 54 different enzyme combinations for 3-hydroxybutyrate (3-HB) 
production to explore the combinations that produced the highest titers 
in the cell-free reaction. Consequently, they defined the best enzyme 
combination for 3-HB production and the titers and yields of 3-HB were 
~ 20 times higher than the reported previously [6]. The second 
demonstration of iPROBE’s data-driven design-of-experiments was the 
increase of the cell-free n-butanol production ~ 4-fold in 12 days by 
assessing the performance of 205 pathways. From those 205, iPROBE 
signified 9 pathway combinations worth testing to give the highly effi­
cient production of butanol with a strong correlation (r2 > 0.9) between 
the cell and cell-free pathway performance. This analysis and production 
would have taken a team of researchers more than 3 months to finish. 
The mathematical models could be beneficial to facilitate the design 
of the CFSs and predict the behaviors of the particular pathways by 
accounting for the transcription and translation, competition and 
depletion of resources, and the batch-to-batch variability. The ordinary 
differential equation (ODE) model is the most frequently used model for 
describing the aspects mentioned above [237]. The first thing measured 
with the ODE model is the transcription and translation, which can be 
divided into 4 phases each [104]. While DNA concentrations tend to be 
C.E. Copeland et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
Biochemical Engineering Journal 175 (2021) 108124
13
constant, mRNA concentrations decrease with time in cell-free re­
actions. As for protein production, the rate increases initially, slows 
down and then comes to a halt. Depending on system parameters, there 
can be degradation of proteins. Michaelis-Menten kinetics have been 
useful for modeling the rate of protein production and degradation 
[237–239]. 
Reversible binding of the RNA polymerase to the DNA or ribosome to 
the mRNA, as well as the reversible binding of the first nucleoside 
triphosphate (NTP) or amino acids followed by the irreversible elonga­
tion, can explain the transcription and translation in more detail [104, 
240–242]. The ODE models that predict the unbinding, binding, and 
elongation could help define each component’s most efficient concen­
trations [243–245]. Resource competition is also an important factor 
that needs to be taken into account when employing these models [237]. 
DNA, amino acids, NTPs, and T7 RNA polymerase are directly added to 
the reaction making it easy to monitor the changes in the reaction with 
respect to varying their concentration. The fixed number of resources 
present in the crude lysate is more difficult to measure but can be 
measured indirectly [241,245,246]. These models described account for 
only transcription and translation, not metabolic production or con­
sumption. This is where constraint-based models have been used, 
especially when various proteins are produced at different levels [247], 
but further developments still need to be made [237]. Numerous ther­
apeutic proteins have trouble being expressed in a correct folding form 
without appropriate aid by the molecular chaperones [248,249]. 
Finding the right chaperone for a particular target is a critical practice to 
synthesize active therapeutic protein. However, this process was 
time-consuming and has limited by the chaperone plurality across the 
species and target proteins [250]. Yang et al. developed a rapid 
screening method to find the optimal chaperone to maximize protein 
solubility [95]. This group used the CFS to tandemly express chaperone 
proteins, and then reactivated the transcription-translation machinery 
via a method called diafiltration, to add substrates that were depleted. 
Then, they started a second reaction in the same mixture as the first, 
retaining the synthesized chaperone protein, to then synthesize and fold 
the protein of interest. To rapidly obtain DNA of the chaperone proteins 
for expression, they amplified the genes from genomic DNA and then 
used the digestion-ligation PCR method to add the T7 promoter and 
ribosome binding site. 
Catherine et al. developed a rapid and reliable parasitic protein an­
tigenicity screening platform to keep up with the rapidly changing life- 
cycle and drug resistance parasites possess by amplifying the parasite 
Clonorchis sinensis’s genes with biotinylated primers which then allowed 
for the DNA templates to be captured by streptavidin on microbeads at 
both ends instantly when synthesized by the CFS [96]. Once captured, 
the antigenicity of the proteins could be discovered by analyzing them 
against patient sera which when positive, the parasite protein could be 
identified by running PCR on the DNA attached to the same microbead. 
Although this method was able to rapidly express many parasite pro­
teins, they still ran into the problem of insolubility for some of them, 
which is what other methods had trouble with as well. This method was 
able to efficiently express most parasite proteins and analyze without 
purification, with the accuracy of the ELISA assay [96]. 
6. Conclusion 
This review spotlights various uses of the CFS, focusing on health­
care, including biosensing, diagnostics, production of therapeutics, 
high-throughput modeling and screening, and portability and conve­
nience. The inherent open characteristics of the CFS provide many ad­
vantages for healthcare applications. However, the CFS has some 
hurdles to jump until it is accepted entirely as a therapeutics and di­
agnostics production machine. The main concern would be the lack of 
standardization of the lysate production process, reaction mixture 
components, and DNA templates [251]. Furthermore, since the system is 
still new in some of its capabilities and applications, complete 
standardization or uncovering of all black boxes that can predict protein 
synthesis outcomes has not occurred. However, many researchers are 
working to solve this by targeting a specific metabolism and utilize 
metabolomic and proteomic analyses [252–255], constraint-based 
modeling [247], and protocol papers [7,92,256–259]. 
The rapid production of proteins and the use of inexpensive com­
ponents brings many benefits to the field of diagnostics. Sensing bio­
logical artifacts such as nucleic acid detection [110–112], hormones 
[114], vitamin levels [115], harmful chemicals and compound levels 
[116–119], heavy metals [119,120], protein biomarkers [121,122] and 
protein-protein interactions [159] can be done precisely, quickly, and 
inexpensively when utilizing the CFS. Personalized medicine is a new 
frontier for the CFS in conjunction with Next-generation sequencing 
(NGS). The success rate of NGS to personalize medicine would increase 
with the accuracy of the in silico prediction programs, which could be 
accelerated by using the CFS [260]. The CFS could bridge the gap in NGS 
between genotype mutations and phenotype expression or metabolic 
disruption. Using the NGS data in CFPS or metabolic pathway outputs 
could be recorded and mapped out in silico [261]. 
Since the CFS system is designed so that the transcription-translation 
energy is solely focused on the user’s pathway of choice, many thera­
peutics can be produced and studied. This open-system also allows the 
user to tune the drug production in a more efficient time manner with its 
design-build-test system abilities. New antibiotics can be created and 
tested more rapidly to catch up with the drought of creation that has 
occurred in the past years [170,175,179]. The production of pharma­
ceuticals has been achieved with the CFS in both crude cell-extract 
systems and the purified enzyme systems [129]. Vaccines and 
virus-like particles have also been produced with the CFS [184,185, 
195–198]. The low-cost, point-of-care capabilities of this system allow 
for wider therapeutic access to people in resource-poor areas or those 
with low mobility. The rapid production the CFS gives also allows cli­
nicians to create new vaccines when they become outdated more effi­
ciently since the screen-produce-test cycle can be sped up greatly. Much 
research in the CFS field has been towards advancing the production of 
various types of proteins in a prokaryotic system, which is why the 
production of antibodies can benefit greatly by using this system. The 
production of fully soluble, non-aggregated, correctly folded 
antigen-binding fragments (Fabs), engineered single-chain antibody 
variable fragments (scFvs), and aglycosylated full-length antibodies 
(IgGs) has been accomplished [69,70], many optimizations and 
advancing projects [71,204,205] and the creation antibody-drug con­
jugates [72] have also been created using the CFS. Cancer therapeutics 
such as onconase [73], trastuzumab for breast cancer [74], and cri­
santaspase for acute lymphocytic leukemia patients [75] have been 
produced using the CFS, as well as stroke and neurological disorder 
therapeutics [76,77]. Antibiotics have also been created using the CFS 
[78]. Lastly, the CFS has been used to screen IgGs for high-specific 
binding allowing for the rapid discovery of synthetic or natural anti­
bodies [93]. 
Among concerns regarding therapeutic production include the CFS’s 
ability to perform post-translational modifications (PTM), which can 
lead to production becoming more complicated and possibly less 
favorable than competitors. However, CFS is constantly improving PTM 
capabilities and has the advantage of agility, low-maintenance storage 
needs, and replaces the need for extensive development and validation 
of a stable cell line with an easily tunable, robust cell extract when 
compared to whole-cell PTM production [262]. 
All these new technologies can be further enhanced with the 
advancement of the portability and convenience aspect of the CFS. As 
shown in recent literature, on-demand, point-of-care is becoming real­
istic with projects utilizing microfluidic devices for synthesizing thera­
peutics [105,106], as well as lyophilizing the CFS showing similar 
function once reconstituted in the creations of paper-based synthetic 
gene networks [109], optimized lyophilized reactions for therapeutic 
production [107], design-build-test, lyophilized pellets [108], and the

utilization of personal glucose monitors [113]. Finally, high-throughput 
screening has been introduced to the CFS field to enhance convince and 
efficiency even further [6,94–96]. Combing the high-processing engines 
of computers with the rapid action of CFSs opens a new world of rapid 
DBT cycles and biosynthetic pathways. In the current synthetic biology 
era, the CFS has been proving to serve a vital role in healthcare as a 
versatile toolbox. We forecast that CFS will keep challenging and pro­
moting human health in the future that lies ahead.

Introduction and objectives: To analyze whether admission on weekends or public holidays (WHA)
inﬂuences the management (performance of angioplasty, percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI]) and
outcomes (in-hospital mortality) of patients hospitalized for acute coronary syndrome in the Spanish
National Health System compared with admission on weekdays.
Methods: Retrospective observational study of patients admitted for ST-segment elevation myocardial
infarction (STEMI) or for non–ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTEACS) in hospitals of
the Spanish National Health system from 2003 to 2018.
Results: A total of 438 987 episodes of STEMI and 486 565 of NSTEACS were selected, of which 28.8% and
26.1% were WHA, respectively. Risk-adjusted models showed that WHA was a risk factor for in-hospital
mortality in STEMI (OR, 1.05; 95%CI,1.03-1.08; P < .001) and in NSTEACS (OR, 1.08; 95%CI, 1.05-1.12;
P < .001). The rate of PCI performance in STEMI was more than 2 percentage points higher in patients
admitted on weekdays from 2003 to 2011 and was similar or even lower from 2012 to 2018, with no
signiﬁcant changes in NSTEACS. WHA was a statistically signiﬁcant risk factor for both STEMI and
NSTEACS.
Conclusions: WHA can increase the risk of in-hospital death by 5% (STEMI) and 8% (NSTEACS). The
persistence of the risk of higher in-hospital mortality, after adjustment for the performance of PCI and
other explanatory variables, probably indicates deﬁciencies in management during the weekend
compared with weekdays.

INTRODUCTION
In 2001, a study indicated that patients admitted during the
weekend had higher mortality than those admitted on weekdays.1
Since then, numerous studies have analyzed the ‘‘weekend effect’’
in a large variety of populations of patients, diseases, health care
providers, and health care systems.2
Identiﬁcation of the weekend effect led to the implementation
of major health care policy interventions (eg, the 7-day hospital
services program in the UK3,4), which have caused considerable
controversy, such as the ﬁrst large-scale physician strike in the
National Health Service in 40 years.5
The debate surrounding the existence and causes of the
weekend effect continues. While some researchers have ques-
tioned 
its 
existence,6
others have 
highlighted 
the ongoing
uncertainty regarding its causes.7
The existence of the weekend effect has also been examined in
the Spanish National Health System (SNHS) in terms of different
aspects of health care quality, including mortality,8–14 but, as far as
we know, no studies have explored its relationship with acute
coronary syndrome (ACS) in Spain.
Therefore, the objective of our study was to analyze if weekend
or public holiday admission (WHA), vs weekday admission, affects
the 
management 
(performance 
of 
angioplasty 
and 
primary
percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI]) and outcomes (in-
hospital mortality) of patients hospitalized for ACS in the SNHS.
METHODS
Population
A retrospective observational study was performed in patients
admitted for ACS in SNHS hospitals between January 1, 2003, and
December 31, 2018. The data source was the Minimum Data Set
(MDS) of the SNHS, which includes data on the demographic
characteristics of hospitalized patients, as well as administrative
variables regarding the care process and clinical variables related
to diagnoses and procedures, coded using the International
Classiﬁcation of Diseases (ICD) 9th (2003-2005) and 10th (2016-
2018) editions.15 The ACS population was divided into 2 groups:
ST-segment elevation acute myocardial infarction (STEMI) and
non–ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTEACS)
(non–ST-segment 
elevation 
acute 
myocardial 
infarction and
unstable angina). The ICD-9 and -10 (Clinical Modiﬁcation) codes
used to identify diagnoses and procedures are detailed in table 1 of
the supplementary data. PCI performance and in-hospital mortali-
ty were compared between WHA patients (considering national
holidays alone) and those admitted on weekdays (from Monday to
Friday, except national holidays).
To improve data consistency, transfers between hospitals were
consolidated in a single episode that was attributed to the more
complex hospital if the destination hospital was identiﬁed. In
addition, episodes corresponding to patients younger than 18 years
were excluded, as well as those corresponding to patients who
were discharged to home and had hospital stays of 1 day or less and
to patients registered as voluntary discharges with an unknown
discharge location or with discharges to another hospital that
could not be resolved after concatenation.
Statistical analysis
Quantitative variables are presented as mean  standard
deviation and categorical variables as frequency and percentage.
For adjustment by the risk of in-hospital mortality, models were
based on the methodology of the Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid Services. The independent variables were those included
in the 30-day acute myocardial infarction mortality model,16 with
adaptation of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services
model to the structure of the MDS data. The secondary diagnoses
were then grouped according to the clinical condition categories
developed by Pope et al.17 and updated annually by the Agency for
Healthcare Research and Quality.16
To analyze the impact of the type of hospital on the association
between WHA or weekday admission and in-hospital mortality,
hospitals were classiﬁed by the availability of cardiology-related
resources using RECALCAR criteria.18 To differentiate the impact
of weekend admission from national holiday admission, the
independent variable WHA was separated into 2 components:
a) national holiday admission (dichotomous); and b) weekday of
hospital admission (categorical, with Tuesday as reference, to
clarify the impact of Friday and Monday, the days immediately
before and after the weekend).
In-hospital mortality was adjusted using multilevel logistic
regression models.19 All adjustment models speciﬁcally consid-
ered comorbidities with statistical signiﬁcance and an odds ratio
(OR) < 1.0. The adjustment models were estimated using
backward elimination; the signiﬁcance thresholds for the selection
and elimination of factors were P < .05 and P  .10, respectively.
Using the speciﬁed models, we calculated risk-adjusted in-hospital
mortality rates (RAMRs).20 Calibration was analyzed graphically
after patients were grouped in deciles with regard to predicted
probabilities, and predicted vs observed mean probabilities were
tabulated, as well as discrimination using the area under the
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.
Quantitative variables were compared using the t test for
2 categories. Categorical variables were compared using the chi-
square test or Fisher exact test.
Temporal trends in mortality and PCI performance during the
study period were assessed using a Poisson regression model with

year as the sole independent variable. In all models, we calculated
the incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and their 95% conﬁdence intervals
(95%CIs).
As sensitivity analysis, we evaluated the changes over time in
the frequency of PCI performance considering, in both groups
(STEMI and NSTEACS), the impact of WHA vs weekday admission;
2 periods were deﬁned, taking as cutoff the year in which a
signiﬁcant change was detected, for which the multilevel model
was adjusted by including PCI performance among the indepen-
dent variables.
All comparisons were 2-sided and differences were considered
signiﬁcant at P < .05. Statistical analyses were performed with
STATA 16 and SPSS v21.0.
RESULTS
In-hospital mortality
In total, 475 362 STEMI episodes and 548 176 NSTEACS episodes
were identiﬁed from 2003 to 2008; after exclusions (ﬁgure 1 of the
supplementary data), we obtained a study population of 438 987
(92.3%) and 486 565 (88.8%) episodes, respectively. Of these, 126
528 (28.8%) and 127 188 (26.1%) were WHAs, without signiﬁcant
variations in these proportions during the study period. The
proﬁles of the patients admitted on weekdays and on weekends or
public holidays were notably homogeneous in the 2 groups (table 1
and table 2), with the exception of a slightly higher rate of
cardiogenic shock and cardiorespiratory failure in patients with
NSTEACS admitted at the weekend.
The crude mortality rate during the study period was 11.7% in
the STEMI group and 5.5% in the NSTEACS group. Both groups
exhibited slightly but signiﬁcantly higher mortality between
weekday admission and WHA (STEMI, 11.6% vs 11.9%, P = .008;
NSTEACS, 5.3% vs 5.9%, P < .001). In STEMI, the crude mortality rate
signiﬁcantly fell during the study period (IRR = 0.998; 95%CI,
0.998-0.999; P < .001) in both patients admitted on weekdays
(IRR = 0.999; 95%CI, 0.999-0.999; P < .001) and those admitted on
public holidays (IRR = 0.998; 95%CI, 0.998-0.999; P < .001). In
contrast, in the NSTEACS group, the crude mortality rate increased
during the study period (IRR = 1.004; 95%CI, 1.000-1.010; P = .002)
in both patients admitted on weekdays (IRR = 1.003; 95%CI, 1.000-
1.010; P = .049) and those admitted on public holidays (IRR = 1.004;
95%CI, 1.002-1.007; P = .003).
The adjusted in-hospital mortality risk models for both STEMI
and NSTEACS showed very good discrimination (ROC, 0.88 and
0.87, respectively) and calibration (table 2 of the supplementary
data, table 3 of the supplementary data, ﬁgure 2 of the
supplementary data, and ﬁgure 3 of the supplementary data).
Both groups exhibited a signiﬁcant trend for a decrease in the
RAMR for both weekday admissions and WHAs (total RAMR of each
group, IRR = 0.999; 95%CI, 0.999-0.999; and IRR = 0.996; 95%CI,
0.995-0.997; both P < .001). The WHA variable was found to be a
risk factor in risk-adjusted models for STEMI (OR = 1.05; 95%CI,
1.03-1.08; P < .001) and NSTEACS (OR = 1.08; 95%CI, 1.05-1.12;
P < .001).

When we analyzed the day of admission and admission on
national holidays separately instead of together in WHA (table 4 of
the supplementary data and table 5 of the supplementary data),
there was a greater effect in both STEMI and NSTEACS of national
holiday admission (OR = 1.11; 95%CI, 1.03-1.19; P < .001; and
OR = 1.15; 95%CI, 1.05-1.26; P < .001) than admission on Saturday
or Sunday (STEMI: OR = 1.04; 95%CI, 1.00-1.09; P = .04; and
OR = 1.03; 95%CI, 0.99-1.08; P = .13; NSTEACS: OR = 1.08; 95%CI,
1.03-1.14; P < .001; and OR = 1.08; 95%CI, 1.02-1.14; P = .01).
In STEMI, hospitals with a catheterization laboratory were
protective factors (RECALCAR types 3, 4, and 5, OR = 0.86, OR = 0.80,
and OR = 0.64, respectively; P < .001); the same effect was found in
NSTEACS, although the results were only signiﬁcant for type
5 hospitals (with catheterization laboratories but without beds
speciﬁcally assigned to cardiology) (type 3, OR = 0.95; type 4,
OR = 0.93 [P > .05]; type 5, OR = 0.72; P < .001); in both cases, WHA
remained a risk factor (STEMI: OR = 1.05; NSTEACS: OR = 1.08;
P < .001).
Percutaneous coronary intervention
From 2003 to 2018, the PCI performance rate was signiﬁcantly
lower in patients with WHA than in those admitted on weekdays in
both STEMI (46.8% vs 48.7%; P < .001) and NSTEACS (28.2% vs
29.1%; P < .001). However, the differences seemed to have no
clinical relevance. In contrast, the rate was signiﬁcantly increased
in STEMI in both patients admitted on weekdays (IRR = 1.069;
95%CI, 1.055-1.082, P < .001) and WHA patients (IRR = 1.078;
95%CI, 1.063-1.092; P < .001), and the same tendency was found in
NSTEACS (weekday admission, IRR = 1.072; 95%CI, 1.061-1.083;
P < .001; WHA, IRR = 1.077; 95%CI, 1.066-1.087; P < .001)
(ﬁgure 1).
Sensitivity analysis: weekend/holiday effect and percutaneous
coronary intervention
Through analysis of the changes over time in the frequency of
PCI performance, a signiﬁcant change was observed in 2012 in both
groups (STEMI and NSTEACS) in patients admitted on weekdays or
weekends/public holidays, and 2 study subperiods were identiﬁed:
2003 to 2011 and 2012 to 2018. The rate of PCI performance in
STEMI was more than 2 percentage points higher in patients
admitted on weekdays from 2003 to 2011 and similar or even
lower from 2012 to 2018 (ﬁgure 1), with a signiﬁcant interaction
between the year and a lower difference in the rate of PCI
performance (the later the period, the lower the difference)
(P = .006). In contrast, this interaction was not found between the
year and the difference in PCI performance in NSTEACS (P = .253).
The performance of PCI in STEMI had a protective effect against
in-hospital mortality at all admission times and in both periods
(2003-2011, OR = 0.25; 95%CI, 0.24-0.26; P < .001; 2012-2018, OR
= 0.29; 95%CI, 0.27-0.30; P < .001). The same effect was observed in
NSTEACS (2003-2011, OR = 0.36; 95%CI, 0.33-0.39; P < .001; 2012-
2018, OR = 0.34; 95%CI, 0.32-0.37; P < .001).
The effect of WHA was identiﬁed as a signiﬁcant risk factor in
both periods in both STEMI and NSTEACS, even when PCI
performance was considered in the multilevel adjustment models
for in-hospital mortality (table 3).

DISCUSSION
Our results show than WHA in SNHS hospitals increases the risk
of in-hospital death by 5% in STEMI patients and 8% in NSTEACS
patients. These ﬁndings are in line with those reported in the
literature, although the underlying cause is still unclear.
In the United States, higher mortality has been reported in
patients admitted during the weekend for ACS,21 as well as for
non–ST-segment elevation acute myocardial infarction.22 In both
studies, the elevated mortality was related to fewer interventional
procedures in these patients during the weekend. However, no
differences were found in mortality in more recent periods (2006-
2016).23 A meta-analysis including 18 European countries and
those from other continents concluded that the weekend effect
was associated with a slight increase (6%) in short-term ACS
mortality.24 That meta-analysis found no signiﬁcant differences
after the analysis was restricted to studies performed from
2005 onwards, although the magnitude of the difference in
mortality was maintained.
The 
widespread 
implementation 
of 
the 
Infarction 
Code
Program25 probably explains the ﬁrst reduction and the practical
erasure of the difference in 2017 and 2018 in the primary PCI
percentage between weekdays and weekends in STEMI. However,
the persistent difference in mortality may indicate the involve-
ment of other elements of the health care process,26 as well as the
performance of PCI. These elements include delays during
weekends and public holidays vs weekdays in patient contact
with the emergency health care system and in the referral of
patients from the emergency services of primary care centers and
hospitals that are not Infarction Code Program referral centers, in
addition to lower agility in the activation of the catheterization
team performing the primary PCI or in the functioning of the
receiving center itself. Light could be shed on this matter using the
time comparison information for weekdays vs weekends/public
holidays in the health system available in the Infarction Code
Program registry.
In this study, the effect of WHA on in-hospital mortality was
slightly higher in NSTEACS than in STEMI. The apparently
contradictory ﬁnding of increased crude in-hospital mortality in
NSTEACS during the study period, in contrast to the reduced
adjusted mortality, is probably explained by the shifting of age at
presentation and, thus, of comorbidities, which highlights the need
for risk adjustments of trend analysis.27 The greater effect of WHA
on NSTEACS is in line with other studies reporting a greater delay
in the performance of early coronary angiography during the
weekend,28–31 an approach recommended by clinical practice
guidelines for high- or very high-risk patients,32 even though these
studies are contradictory regarding higher mortality at the
weekend. As in STEMI, the risk stratiﬁcation of in-hospital death
by PCI performance showed higher risk-adjusted mortality in
NSTEACS for WHA. In principle, this could lead to analysis of the
same causes associated with the value chain of the health care
process as those described for STEMI, although it must be
remembered that the differences in the PCI performance rates
between WHA and weekday admissions are small and might not be
clinically signiﬁcant. The MDS does not provide information on the
timing of PCI performance. Thus, in contrast to STEMI, in which
practically all PCIs without concomitant ﬁbrinolysis in the episode
are primary PCIs, we cannot rule out the possibility that, in
NSTEACS, PCIs were delayed vs the guideline recommendations.

The higher in-hospital mortality in both STEMI and NSTEACS
during the weekend/public holidays could be due to the patient
proﬁle, because these patients could be more severe than those
admitted during the week. However, risk-adjusted mortalities
were compared in this study and no signiﬁcant epidemiological
differences (eg, age, sex, and comorbidities) were found in the
proﬁle of patients admitted at the weekend or on weekdays
(table 1 and table 2), and the percentages of cardiogenic shock,
cardiorespiratory failure, and heart failure were practically the
same in the 2 groups. The meta-analysis by Kwok et al.24 also
failed to ﬁnd differences in the proﬁle of patients that would
explain the higher mortality on the weekend, with the most
plausible explanations being staff and organizational differences
between weekdays and weekends. In addition, some studies
indicate that a lack of information at handovers during WHA can
aggravate the clinical situation of patients and that the use of
checklists or standardized handover models could mitigate these
effects.33,34
Limitations
Our study has several limitations. Due to its observational and
retrospective design, we cannot exclude the possible existence of
a selection bias and a possible effect of unmeasured confounding
factors. In addition, given the data source, there may be biases
because the MDS does not collect information on certain
clinically relevant variables—such as date and time of PCI
performance, the artery affected, multivessel disease, and left
ventricular ejection fraction—and the quality of the data on
diagnoses and procedures performed in patients during their
hospitalization depends on the coding adequacy in each hospital.
Moreover, the MDS does not provide information allowing a
comparison of outcomes between WHA patients and outcomes
obtained on weekdays by the timing of catheterization alert
activation. However, in contrast, one of the strengths is that the
use of administrative databases for investigating health out-
comes has been validated through their comparison with data
extracted from medical records,35 as well as that the MDS
provides considerable statistical power because it includes a
nationwide population over a large time period and with
established validity for the study of ACS in the SNHS.36
In contrast to the models developed by the Centers for Medicare
& Medicaid Services, the MDS did not record comorbidities present
at admission until 2016, which is why the secondary diagnoses
used as adjustment variables could be comorbidities or complica-
tions that occasionally reﬂect inadequate management.34 None-
theless, the models used in this study are comparable with other
published models regarding their discrimination capacity.16 In
addition, it must be remembered that the adjustment models
include confounding factors that are impossible to consider and
may have a signiﬁcant impact.
CONCLUSIONS
In patients with ACS, WHA in SNHS hospitals increases the risk
of in-hospital death by 5% in STEMI patients and 8% in NSTEACS
patients. Although the higher risk in STEMI could be due to a lower
rate of PCI in WHAs, the risk increase was maintained from 2012 to
2018, a period in which the PCI rate was the same on weekdays and
weekends, probably due to the widespread implementation of the
Infarction Code Program. Analysis of the differences in care times
between weekdays and weekends/public holidays in health care
services with registries (in the absence of a national registry) could
shed light on which part of the observed effect may be due to this
cause and which is due to management deﬁciencies during the
weekend vs weekdays that could reﬂect the general functioning of
hospitals, as well as the entire value chain of the health care
process.

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
None.
WHAT IS KNOWN ABOUT THE TOPIC?
– Increased in-hospital mortality has been reported in
patients admitted at weekends.
– Studies of the ‘‘weekend effect’’ in patients admitted for
acute coronary syndrome in different countries are
contradictory but generally indicate slightly higher
mortality.
– Spanish 
hospitals 
have 
shown 
higher 
in-hospital
mortality associated with the weekend.
WHAT DOES THIS STUDY ADD?
– This is the ﬁrst study to analyze the weekend effect
regarding the management of acute coronary syndrome
in Spain.
– Our results indicated higher mortality in patients
admitted for acute coronary syndrome during weekends
and on public holidays, even in ST-segment elevation
acute myocardial infarction and despite the widespread
implementation of the Infarction Code Program and the
erasure of differences in the primary angioplasty
percentage between patients admitted on weekdays
or public holidays.

Bisphosphonates
 are
 considered
 ﬁrst-line
 agents
 in
 the
 treatment
 of
 postmenopausal
 osteo-
porosis
 based
 on
 extensive
 experience
 of
 use,
 safety,
 and
 proven
 efﬁcacy
 in
 reducing
vertebral,
 non-vertebral
 and
 femur
 fractures.
 However,
 post-marketing
 reports
 based
 on
the
 treatment
 of
 millions
 of
 patients/year
 over
 lengthy
 periods
 of
 time
 have
 revealed
 the
occurrence
 of
 initially
 unexpected
 adverse
 effects,
 such
 as
 osteonecrosis
 of
 the
 jaw
 and
atypical
 femoral
 fracture,
 leading
 to
 the
 restriction
 of
 treatment
 duration
 with
 bisphospho-
nates
 by
 global
 regulatory
 agencies.
 However,
 despite
 the
 association
 between
 these
 effects
and
 bisphosphonates,
 this
 risk
 should
 be
 analyzed
 in
 the
 context
 of
 osteoporosis
 treatment,
alongside
 the
 beneﬁt
 of
 preventing
 osteoporotic
 fractures
 and
 their
 clinical
 consequences.
Therefore,
 we
 consider
 it
 plausible
 to
 discuss
 the
 restriction
 to
 the
 use
 of
 bisphosphonates,
possible
 indications
 for
 prolonged
 treatment
 and
 alternative
 therapies
 following
 the
 suspen-
sion  of
 this
 drug
 class
 for
 patients
 with
 persistent
 high
 risk
 of
 fracture
 after
 initial
 treatment,
especially
 considering
 the
 problems
 of
 public
 health
 funding
 in
 Brazil
 and
 the
 shortage
 of
drugs
 provided
 by
 the
 government.
 Thus,
 to
 standardize
 the
 treatment
 of
 osteoporosis
 in
 the
public
 health
 care
 system,
 we
 aim
 to
 develop
 a
 proposal
 for
 a
 scientiﬁcally-based
 pharmaco-
logical
 treatment
 for
 postmenopausal
 osteoporosis,
 establishing
 criteria
 for
 indication
 and
allowing
 the
 rational
 use
 of
 each
 pharmacological
 agent.
 We  discuss
 the
 duration
 of
 the
 ini-
tial
 bisphosphonate
 treatment,
 the
 therapeutic
 options
 for
 refractory
 patients
 and
 potential
indications
 of
 other
 classes
 of
 drugs
 as
 ﬁrst-choice
 treatment
 in
 the
 sphere
 of
 public
 health,
in
 which
 assessing
 risk
 and
 cost
 effectiveness
 is
 a
 priority.

Introduction
Osteoporosis
 is
 characterized
 by
 loss
 of
 bone
 mass
 and
 dete-
rioration
 of
 tissue
 microarchitecture,
 leading
 to
 bone
 fragility
and
 increased
 risk
 of
 fractures,
 the
 clinical
 consequences
 of
which
 are
 deformities,
 chronic
 pain,
 disability
 and
 death.1 It
is
 a
 common
 disease
 with
 increasing
 prevalence
 among
 men
and
 women
 due
 to
 increased
 life
 expectancy
 and
 an
 aging
population.
Bisphosphonates
 represent
 the
 ﬁrst-line
 therapy
 for
 the
prevention
 of
 osteoporotic
 fractures.2 These
 drugs
 are
 syn-
thetic
 
analogs
 
of
 
inorganic
 
pyrophosphate
 
obtained
 
by
replacing
 the
 oxygen
 atom
 with
 a
 carbon
 (P-C-P),
 making
 them
resistant
 to
 biological
 degradation,
 and
 by
 adding
 two
 side
chains
 (R1
 and
 R2),
 responsible
 for
 skeletal
 binding
 afﬁnity
and
 power,
 respectively.
 This
 chemical
 structure
 has
 the
 prop-
erty
 of
 forming
 compounds
 with
 divalent
 cations,
 showing
great
 avidity
 with
 hydroxyapatite
 crystals
 of
 bone
 surfaces,
particularly
 of
 active
 remodeling
 sites.
 In
 the
 acid
 environ-
ment
 of
 resorption,
 bisphosphonates
 are
 released
 from
 the
bone
 and
 absorbed
 by
 the
 osteoclast,
 causing
 the
 inhibition
of
 the
 enzyme
 farnesyl
 pyrophosphate
 synthase,
 which
 is
important
 for
 the
 integrity
 of
 its
 cytoskeleton
 and
 cell
 func-
tion.
 This
 leads
 to
 a
 loss
 in
 resorptive
 function
 and
 potential
osteoclast
 apoptosis.
 Considering
 that
 bone
 formation
 and
resorption
 are
 coupled
 processes,
 reduced
 resorption
 is
 fol-
lowed
 by
 a
 decrease
 in
 bone
 formation,
 thus
 achieving
 a
new
 state
 of
 decreased
 bone
 remodeling
 after
 starting
 the
treatment.3
The
 ﬁrst
 drug
 of
 this
 class
 was
 synthesized
 in
 the
 19th
century,
 but
 its
 clinical
 relevance
 was
 only
 recognized
 in
 the
late
 1960s,
 when
 bisphosphonates
 started
 being
 used
 in
 the
treatment
 of
 various
 bone
 metabolic
 diseases.4 However,
 the
widespread
 use
 of
 bisphosphonates
 in
 osteoporosis
 therapy
occurred
 after
 1993,
 when
 World
 Health
 Organization
 (WHO)
established
 the
 diagnosis
 of
 osteoporosis
 by
 the
 technique
of
 bone
 densitometry
 by
 dual-energy
 X-ray
 absorptiometry
(DEXA).5
Effectiveness
 of
 bisphosphonates
 in  the
prevention
 of
 osteoporotic
 fractures
Alendronate,
 risedronate,
 ibandronate
 and
 zoledronic
 acid
 are
the
 bisphosphonates
 currently
 approved
 for
 the
 treatment
of
 osteoporosis.
 The
 anti-fracture
 efﬁcacy
 of
 these
 drugs
 has
been
 established
 by
 large
 population
 studies.6–9 Initially,
 Liber-
man  et
 al.,6 in
 a
 phase
 III
 study
 (n
 =
 994
 women,
 age
 45–80
years,
 lumbar
 spine
 T-score
 ≤
 −2.5,
 3-year
 follow-up),
 showed
a
 48%
 reduction
 in
 the
 risk
 of
 radiographic
 vertebral
 fractures
with
 use
 of
 alendronate,
 which
 was
 approved
 for
 treatment
 of
osteoporosis
 in
 the
 US
 in
 1995.
 The
 ﬁrst
 major
 study
 designed
to
 evaluate
 the
 effect
 of
 this
 drug
 on
 the
 risk
 of
 vertebral
 and
non-vertebral
 fractures
 was
 the
 Fracture
 Interventional
 Trial

 which
showed
 a
 reduction
 of
 47%,
 55%
 and
 51%
 in
 the
 risk
 of
 radio-
graphic
 vertebral
 fractures,
 clinical
 vertebral
 fractures
 and
femur
 fractures,
 respectively,
 in
 this
 group
 of
 postmenopausal
women with
 previous
 vertebral
 fractures.7
The
 second
 bisphosphonate
 approved
 for
 the
 treatment
of
 osteoporosis
 in
 the
 US
 was
 risedronate,
 in
 2000.
 The
use
 of
 risedronate
 (VERT
 study,
 n
 =
 2458

 <85

 vertebral
 fractures

 resulted
 in
41%
 and
 39%
 reductions
 in
 vertebral
 and
 non-vertebral
 frac-
tures,
 respectively.9 Then,
 a
 40%
 reduction
 of
 hip
 fracture
 risk
was
 shown
 by
 McLung
 et
 al.
 in
 a
 large
 study
 that
 included
5445
 women aged
 70–79,
 with
 neck
 T-score
 ≤
 −4.0
 or
 neck
 T-
score
 ≤
 −3.0
 plus
 1
 risk
 factor
 for
 hip
 fracture,
 in
 a
 two-year
follow-up.10
Ibandronate,
 approved
 in
 2005
 for
 the
 treatment
 of
 osteo-
porosis,
 reduced
 the
 risk
 of
 vertebral
 fracture
 by
 62%
 (BONE
study,
 n
 =

 women,
 age
 55–80
 years,
 T-score
 ≤

 in
 at
least
 one
 vertebra
 plus
 prior
 vertebral
 fracture,
 3-year
 follow-
up).
 In
 this
 study,
 there
 was
 no
 reduction
 in
 the
 risk
 of
non-vertebral
 fractures,
 except
 for
 a
 post
 hoc
 analysis
 of
 the
subgroup
 of
 women with
 neck
 T-score
 <
 −3.0.11 In
 order
 to
estimate
 the
 effect
 on
 non-vertebral
 fractures,
 a
 few
 meta-
analyzes
 of
 randomized
 studies
 that
 evaluated
 individual
patient
 data
 were
 published
 suggesting
 a
 beneﬁcial
 effect
 of
higher
 doses
 of
 ibandronate
 (corresponding
 to
 150
 mg/month
orally
 or
 12
 mg/year
 i.v.).12,13 However,
 there
 is
 no
 evidence
from
 placebo-controlled
 studies
 showing
 a
 reduced
 risk
 of
non-vertebral
 fracture
 with
 the
 use
 of
 ibandronate.
Zoledronic
 acid,
 a
 bisphosphonate
 with
 greater
 antiresorp-
tive
 potency,
 was
 approved
 for
 the
 treatment
 of
 osteoporosis
in
 2007.
 An
 annual
 infusion
 of
 zoledronic
 acid
 for
 3
 consec-
utive
 years
 (HORIZON
 PFT,
 n
 =
 7765
 women,
 age
 65–89
 years,
neck
 T-score
 ≤
 −2.5
 or
 neck
 T-score
 ≤
 −1.5
 plus
 1
 vertebral
fracture,
 3-year
 follow-up)
 was
 effective
 in
 reducing
 by
 70%,
41%
 and
 25%
 the
 risk
 of
 vertebral,
 femur
 and
 non-vertebral
fractures,
 respectively.14
Safety
 of  bisphosphonates
 in
 osteoporosis
treatment
Given
 that
 osteoporosis
 is
 a
 chronic
 disease,
 along
 with
the
 good
 safety
 proﬁle
 of
 bisphosphonates
 demonstrated
 by
placebo-controlled
 studies,
 osteoporosis
 treatment
 should,
conceptually,
 be
 extended
 throughout
 the
 patient’s
 whole
 life.
However,
 post-marketing
 reports
 based
 on
 the
 treatment
 of
millions
 of
 patients/year
 over
 a
 lengthy
 period
 of
 time
 revealed
the
 occurrence
 of
 initially
 unexpected
 adverse
 effects
 of
 bis-
phosphonate
 treatment
 such
 as
 osteonecrosis
 of
 the
 jaw
 (ONJ)
and
 atypical
 femoral
 fracture.15–17
ONJ
 is
 characterized
 by
 exposure
 of
 bone
 tissue
 in
 the
maxillofacial
 region
 without
 healing
 after
 8
 weeks.18 Evidence
suggests
 the
 existence
 of
 a
 causal
 relationship
 between
 the
use
 of
 bisphosphonates
 and
 ONJ,
 with
 a
 dose-response
 effect
due
 to
 the
 greater
 incidence
 of
 this
 complication
 in
 cancer
patients
 receiving
 high
 cumulative
 doses
 of
 bisphosphonates.
The
 prevalence
 was
 estimated
 at
 0.4%
 among
 cancer
 patients
and
 0.001%
 in
 patients
 with
 osteoporosis
 in
 a
 survey
 of
 cases
observed
 by
 Canadian
 maxillofacial
 surgeons.19 A
 random-
ized,
 double-blind,
 placebo-controlled
 study
 involving
 2046
patients
 with
 breast
 cancer
 observed
 the
 occurrence
 of
 ONJ
in
 2.0%
 and
 1.4%
 of
 those
 treated
 with
 high
 doses
 of
 deno-
sumab
 or
 zoledronic
 acid,
 respectively
 (p
 =
 0.39),
 revealing
 that
this
 effect
 is
 not
 speciﬁc
 to
 bisphosphonates,
 but
 to
 treatment
with
 potent
 antiresorptives.20 Therefore,
 ONJ
 is
 very
 rare
 in
 the
treatment
 of
 osteoporosis
 and
 discontinuation
 of
 antiresorp-
tive
 therapy
 in
 osteoporotic
 patients
 prior
 to
 dental
 procedures
possibly
 does
 not
 have
 any
 impact
 in
 reducing
 this
 risk.
However,
 recently,
 the
 Task
 Force
 on
 ONJ
 recommended
to
 stop
 antiresorptive
 therapy,
 if
 it
 is
 possible
 to
 do
 so
 with-
out
 adverse
 consequences
 for
 bone
 health,
 in
 patients
 who
require
 extensive
 invasive
 oral
 surgery
 as
 well
 as
 those
 with
multiple
 risk
 factors
 for
 ONJ,
 although
 there
 is
 little
 evidence
to
 support
 this
 recommendation
 as
 bisphosphonates
 remain
in
 bone
 for
 years.21 Therefore,
 clinical
 judgment
 is
 always
essential.
A
 further
 complication
 observed
 following
 the
 marketing
of
 bisphosphonates
 was
 atypical
 femoral
 fracture
 deﬁned
 as
noncomminuted
 transverse
 or
 short
 oblique
 fractures,
 which
occur
 in
 the
 subtrochanteric
 region
 after
 minimal
 trauma.22
Despite
 the
 inconclusive
 studies
 on
 bone
 physical
 properties
in
 bisphosphonates
 users,
 it
 is
 believed
 that
 such
 fractures
 are
the
 result
 of
 excessive
 and
 prolonged
 suppression
 of
 remod-
eling,
 causing
 loss
 of
 bone
 quality
 and
 mechanical
 function,
which
 leads
 to
 the
 accumulation
 of
 microfractures
 and
 skele-
tal
 fragility.
 The
 result
 is
 the
 development
 of
 insufﬁciency
fractures
 at
 the
 maximum
 mechanical
 overload
 point
 rep-
resented
 by
 the
 subtrochanteric
 or
 diaphyseal
 region
 of
 the
femur.
 Hence
 the
 term
 atypical
 fracture,
 since
 it
 involves
 the
strongest
 region
 of
 the
 femur,
 unlike
 osteoporotic
 fracture,
which
 commonly
 occurs
 in
 the
 femoral
 neck.23
After
 reviewing
 12,777
 femur
 fractures
 cases
 that
 occurred
in
 Sweden
 in
 2008,
 Schilcher
 et
 al.24 identiﬁed
 59
 atypical
fractures,
 78%
 of
 which
 occurred
 in
 bisphosphonates
 users.
Despite
 this
 association,
 the
 absolute
 risk
 of
 atypical
 fracture
related
 to
 the
 use
 of
 bisphosphonates
 is
 low
 (50
 cases/100,000
patients-year).
 Dell
 et
 al.25 analyzed
 approximately
 15,000
subtrochanteric
 fractures
 in
 California
 between
 2007
 and
 2009,
identifying
 102
 atypical
 fractures,
 97
 of
 which
 in
 patients
using
 bisphosphonates
 for
 an
 average
 of
 5.5
 years.
 However,
when
 analyzing
 the
 use
 of
 bisphosphonates
 over
 time,
 the
absolute
 risk
 was
 2
 cases/100,000
 patients-year
 in
 2
 years
 of
treatment
 and
 78
 cases/100,000
 patients-year
 in
 8
 years
 of
treatment.
Warnings
 from
 drug
 regulatory
 agencies
worldwide
A
 report
 issued
 by
 the
 Brazilian
 Agência
 Nacional
 de
 Vigilância
Sanitária
 (ANVISA)
 in
 2013
 warned
 prescribers
 about
 long-
term
 safety
 issues
 of
 bisphosphonates
 and
 recommended
 to
stop
 therapy
 after
 three
 years,
 analyzing
 for
 each
 individ-
ual
 patient
 whether
 the
 use
 of
 this
 class
 of
 drugs
 for
 more
than
 3
 years
 is
 necessary
 and
 justiﬁable.26 This
 warns
 con-
curs
 with
 reports
 issued
 by
 the
 Food
 and
 Drug
 Administration
(FDA)
 in
 2010
 and
 by
 the
 European
 Medicines
 Agency
 (EMA)
 in
2011.27,28

Impact
 of
 the
 regulatory
 restriction
 on
 duration
of
 bisphosphonates
 use
 in
 the
 Brazilian
 public
health
 system:
 a  critical
 analysis
Despite
 
the
 
association
 
demonstrated
 
between
 
atypical
femoral
 fractures
 and
 bisphosphonates,
 this
 risk
 should
 be
analyzed
 in
 the
 context
 of
 osteoporosis
 treatment,
 alongside
the
 beneﬁt
 of
 preventing
 osteoporotic
 fractures.
 It
 is
 estimated
that
 for
 each
 100
 typical
 femoral
 fractures
 prevented
 by
 bis-
phosphonates,
 1
 atypical
 fracture
 occurs.29 For
 patients
 with
severe
 osteoporosis
 and
 high
 risk
 of
 fracture,
 3300
 osteoporotic
fractures
 are
 prevented
 per
 100,000
 patients-year
 treated,
while
 for
 patients
 with
 moderate
 risk,
 1700
 osteoporotic
 frac-
tures
 are
 prevented
 per
 100,000
 patients-year
 treated
 with
bisphosphonates.22 Therefore,
 the
 effectiveness
 of
 this
 class
of
 drugs
 in
 the
 prevention
 of
 osteoporotic
 fractures
 in
 patients
with
 moderate
 to
 high
 risk
 osteoporosis
 outweighs
 the
 risk
 of
atypical
 fractures
 (Fig.
 1).30
In
 Brazil,
 where
 the
 constitution
 guarantees
 universal
access
 to
 health
 care,
 only
 raloxifene
 and
 alendronate
 are
 reg-
ularly
 available
 in
 our
 public
 health
 system.
 In
 order
 to
 obtain
drugs
 such
 as
 zoledronic
 acid
 and
 teriparatide,
 patients
 turn
to
 the
 courts,
 obliging
 the
 government
 to
 provide
 the
 medica-
tions,
 which
 disrupts
 its
 budget
 and
 impairs
 health
 policies.
Thus,
 it
 is
 reasonable
 to
 question
 the
 restriction
 on
 the
 use
 of
bisphosphonates,
 especially
 when
 we
 consider
 public
 health
funding
 problems
 in
 Brazil
 and
 the
 scarcity
 of
 drugs
 supplied
by
 the
 government.
Therefore,
 given
 the
 potential
 severity
 of
 osteoporosis,
the
 absolute
 low
 risk
 of
 atypical
 fracture
 and
 the
 restricted
drug
 supply
 by
 our
 public
 health
 system,
 it
 is
 reason-
able
 to
 propose
 long-term
 bisphosphonates
 treatment
 for
women
 with
 osteoporosis
 and
 moderate
 to
 high
 risk
 of
fracture.
With
 the
 objective
 of
 standardizing
 the
 treatment
 of
 osteo-
porosis
 in
 Brazilian
 public
 health
 care
 system,
 as
 well
 as
reducing
 the
 phenomenon
 of
 judicialization
 of
 health,
 we
propose
 to
 develop
 a
 scientiﬁcally-based
 protocol
 for
 the
 treat-
ment
 of
 postmenopausal
 osteoporosis,
 establishing
 criteria
for
 indication
 and
 allowing
 the
 rational
 use
 of
 each
 pharma-
cological
 agent.

Efﬁcacy
 of
 prolonged
 treatment
 with
bisphosphonates
It
 is
 worth
 examining
 whether
 prolonged
 use
 of
 bisphospho-
nates
 offers
 beneﬁts,
 since
 these
 drugs
 accumulate
 in
 the
skeleton
 and
 continue
 to
 be
 released
 for
 months
 to
 years
after
 the
 treatment
 is
 suspended,
 resulting
 in
 a
 residual
 anti-
fracture
 effect.31 Below
 are
 described
 some
 extension
 studies
of
 treatment
 with
 bisphosphonates.
The
 extension
 of
 the
 FIT
 study
 (Fracture
 Interventional
 Trial
Long-term
 Extension,
 FLEX),
 in
 which,
 following
 the
 ﬁrst
 5
years
 with
 alendronate,
 patients
 in
 the
 treated
 group
 were
 ran-
domized
 into
 5
 more
 years
 of
 alendronate
 or
 placebo,
 showed
no
 difference
 in
 the
 risk
 of
 non-vertebral
 fracture
 and
 mor-
phometric
 vertebral
 fractures
 between
 the
 groups.
 However,
it
 demonstrated
 a
 reduced
 risk
 of
 clinically
 apparent
 verte-
bral
 fractures
 (RR:
 0.45;
 95%CI
 0.24–0.85)
 in
 patients
 continuing
treatment
 for
 10
 years.32 It
 is
 noteworthy
 that,
 in
 the
 FLEX
study,
 many
 women had
 osteopenia
 only,
 and
 those
 with
a
 femur
 neck
 T-score
 <
 −3.5
 were
 excluded,
 indicating
 that
part
 of
 them
 already
 presented
 low
 risk
 and
 had
 no
 need
 to
prolong
 treatment.
 Moreover,
 a
 subsequent
 analysis
 of
 FLEX
data
 showed
 that
 maintenance
 of
 alendronate
 for
 10
 years
 in
the
 subgroup
 of
 women
 with
 a
 femoral
 neck
 T-score
 ≤
 −2.5
decreased
 by
 50%
 the
 risk
 of
 non-vertebral
 fractures
 (RR:
 0.50,
CI
 95%
 0.26–0.96).33 These
 results
 indicate
 that
 some
 women,
especially
 those
 with
 high
 risk
 of
 fracture,
 can
 beneﬁt
 from
the
 maintenance
 of
 treatment
 with
 alendronate
 for
 10
 years.
In
 other
 words,
 the
 effectiveness
 of
 the
 prolonged
 treatment
depends
 on
 the
 fracture
 risk,
 which
 can
 be
 evaluated,
 among
other
 aspects,
 by
 Bone
 Mineral
 Density
 (BMD).
To
 investigate
 the
 long-term
 effects
 of
 zoledronic
 acid,
patients
 who
 had
 been
 treated
 for
 3
 years
 in
 the
 HORIZON
study
 were
 randomized
 into
 3
 more
 years
 of
 zoledronic
 acid
or
 placebo.
 This
 study
 showed
 a
 reduction
 in
 the
 risk
 of
morphometric
 vertebral
 fractures
 (OR:
 0.51;
 p
 =
 0.035)
 with
 con-
tinued
 treatment.
 This
 ﬁnding
 led
 to
 the
 conclusion
 that
 many
patients
 can
 safely
 discontinue
 the
 medication
 after
 the
 initial
3
 years
 of
 treatment,
 while
 some
 of
 them
 may
 beneﬁt
 from
 the
maintenance
 of
 zoledronic
 acid
 for
 another
 3
 years.34
We  can
 conclude
 that
 suspension
 of
 the
 bisphosphonate
after
 3
 (zoledronic
 acid)
 to
 5
 years
 (alendronate)
 is
 justiﬁed
for
 patients
 who,
 at
 the
 end
 of
 this
 period,
 present
 low
risk
 of
 fracture.
 However,
 those
 who
 persist
 with
 femoral
T-score
 ≤
 −2.5
 after
 the
 initial
 course
 of
 treatment
 should
have
 this
 treatment
 continued
 for
 up
 to
 6
 (zoledronic
 acid)
to
 10
 years
 (alendronate).
 Moreover,
 despite
 the
 absence
 of
evidence-based
 recommendations,
 it
 is
 likely
 that
 women
who
 persist
 with
 moderate
 to
 high
 risk
 of
 fractures
 due
 to
factors
 independent
 of
 femoral
 T-score
 may
 also
 beneﬁt
 from
treatment
 maintenance.

 studies:

 to
 do
 in
 the
 case
 of
women
 who
 persist
 with
 high
 risk
 of
 fracture
following
 10
 years
 of
 treatment
 with
bisphosphonates?
Some
 women  persist
 with
 severe
 osteoporosis
 and

risk
 of
 fracture
 even
 after

bisphosphonates,
 becoming
 candidates
 for
 treatment
 with
other
 anti-osteoporotic
 drugs.
 However,
 bisphosphonates
 are
potent
 suppressors
 of
 bone
 remodeling
 and
 have
 high
 afﬁnity
and
 retention
 time
 in
 the
 bone,
 inhibiting
 turnover
 for
 years
after
 their
 suspension.
 Therefore,
 the
 impact
 of
 the
 switch
 to
other
 drugs
 must
 be
 carefully
 analyzed.35,36
Given
 the
 greater
 potency
 of
 the
 zoledronic
 acid,
 McLung
et
 al.37 studied
 the
 effect
 of
 a
 single
 dose
 of
 this
 drug
 in
menopausal
 women previously
 treated
 with
 alendronate
 for
an
 average
 time
 of
 4
 years
 (n
 =
 225,
 age
 46–79
 years,
 spine
 or
neck
 T-score
 ≤
 −2.0).
 BMD
 remained
 essentially
 stable
 after
 12
months
 of
 alendronate
 or
 zoledronic
 acid,
 with
 no
 difference
between
 the
 groups.
Denosumab,
 the
 ﬁrst
 biological
 drug
 approved
 for
 the
 treat-
ment
 of
 osteoporosis,
 is
 a
 monoclonal
 antibody
 that
 binds
 to
receptor
 activator
 of
 nuclear
 factor
 kappa
 
 ligand
 (RANKL),
a
 cytokine
 secreted
 by
 the
 osteoblast
 considered
 essential
for
 the
 differentiation,
 activity
 and
 survival
 of
 osteoclasts,
potently
 reducing
 bone
 resorption
 and
 the
 risk
 of
 vertebral
(68%),
 non-vertebral
 (20%)
 and
 femur
 (40%)
 fracture.38,39
T
wo
 
studies
 
investigated
 
the
 
effects
 
of
 
denosumab
in
 patients
 previously
 treated
 with
 bisphosphonates.40,41
Kendler
 et
 al.,40 analyzing
 patients
 treated
 with
 alendronate
for
 an
 average
 of
 36
 months
 (n
 =
 504,
 age
 ≥
 55
 years,
 −4.0
 ≤
 T-
score
 ≥
 −2.0),
 observed
 that
 the
 transition
 to
 denosumab
resulted
 in
 a
 signiﬁcantly
 greater
 increase
 of
 BMD
 in
 the
total
 femur
 and
 lumbar
 spine
 after
 12
 months
 compared
 to
the
 maintenance
 of
 alendronate
 (1.9%
 vs.
 1.0%
 total
 femur,
p
 <
 0.0001;
 3.0%
 vs.
 1.8%
 lumbar
 spine,
 p
 <
 0.0001).
In
 patients
 using
 alendronate
 irregularly
 for
 a
 median
of
 20
 months
 (n
 =
 870,
 age
 ≥
 55
 years),
 there
 was
 a
 signiﬁ-
cantly
 greater
 increase
 in
 BMD
 at
 all
 bone
 sites
 following
 the
transition
 to
 denosumab
 compared
 with
 the
 transition
 to
 rise-
dronate
 (total
 femur
 2.0%
 vs.
 0.5%,
 neck
 1.4%
 vs.
 0%;
 spine
 3.4%
vs.
 1.1%,
 p
 <
 0.0001
 at
 all
 sites).41
Denosumab
 and
 bisphosphonates
 are
 both
 antiresorptive
drugs,
 but
 have
 different
 mechanisms
 of
 action.
 They
 decrease
osteoclast
 activity
 and
 survival,
 but
 RANKL
 inhibition
 by
denosumab
 also
 prevents
 the
 differentiation
 of
 these
 cells.42
Furthermore,
 it
 is
 possible
 that
 bone
 formation
 in
 a
 resorption-
independent
 process,
 known
 as
 bone-modeling,
 persists
 at
a
 lesser
 extent
 in
 adult
 skeletons
 and
 is
 preserved
 during
denosumab
 treatment,
 as
 it
 was
 recently
 demonstrated
 in
cynomolgus
 monkeys
 treated
 with
 denosumab.43 Detection
of
 endocortical
 and
 periosteal
 surface
 ﬂuorochrome
 labeling
reﬂected
 continued
 bone
 formation
 at
 speciﬁc
 sites,
 outside
the
 trabecular
 compartment,
 providing
 preclinical
 evidence
for
 a
 potential
 mechanism
 that
 could
 contribute
 to
 the
 effects
of
 denosumab
 in
 BMD
 and
 fracture
 risk.43 The
 different
 mech-
anism
 of
 action
 may
 be
 responsible
 for
 the
 further
 increase
 in
bone
 mass
 caused
 by
 denosumab
 in
 previous
 bisphosphonate
users.40
However,
 when
 BMD
 was
 analyzed
 according
 to
 the
length
 of
 prior
 alendronate
 use,
 a
 greater
 increase
 in
 BMD
with
 denosumab
 was
 observed
 in
 groups
 with
 shorter
 alen-
dronate
 treatment
 duration,
 which
 can
 be
 explained
 by
 the
ﬁlling
 of
 the
 bone
 remodeling
 units
 during
 the
 previous
antiresorptive
 treatment.40 This
 hypothesis
 can
 also
 explain
the
 greater
 BMD
 gain
 with
 teriparatide
 in
 treatment-naïve
patients.40
In
 this
 context,
 it
 is
 worth
 noting
 that
 these
 authors
 studied
the
 effect
 of
 denosumab
 in
 women
 receiving
 bisphosphonates
for
 a
 maximum
 period
 of
 4
 years,
 while,
 in
 our
 proposal,
 we
intend
 to
 justify
 the
 use
 of
 other
 drugs
 after
 10
 years
 of
 bis-
phosphonates,
 which
 we
 suggest
 as
 a
 therapeutic
 strategy
 for
our
 public
 health
 reality.
 Given
 the
 lack
 of
 transitional
 studies
after
 such
 a
 long
 therapeutic
 course
 with
 bisphosphonates,
 it
is
 our
 assumption
 that
 the
 switch
 to
 another
 antiresorptive
drug
 might
 not
 offer
 any
 additional
 beneﬁt
 in
 this
 particular
circumstance.
Unlike
 the
 antiresorptive
 drugs
 discussed
 above,
 teri-
paratide,
 
the
 
1-34
 
N-terminal
 
fragment
 
of
 
parathyroid
hormone
 (PTH),
 is
 an
 anabolic
 agent
 (inducer
 of
 osteoblast
bone
 formation)
 whose
 intermittent
 administration
 results
 in
the
 increase
 in
 the
 number
 and
 activity
 of
 osteoblasts,
 caus-
ing
 rapid
 bone
 mass
 increase
 and
 improved
 trabecular
 and
cortical
 architecture.44 It
 is
 the
 only
 class
 of
 anabolic
 drugs
currently
 used
 in
 the
 treatment
 of
 osteoporosis.
 It
 causes
 a
signiﬁcant
 reduction
 in
 the
 risk
 of
 vertebral
 (RR:
 0.35;
 CI
 95%
0.22–0.55)
 and
 non-vertebral
 (RR:
 0.47;
 CI
 95%
 0.25–0.88)
 frac-
tures
 in
 menopausal
 women
 with
 prior
 vertebral
 fractures
(n
 =
 1637),
 although
 reduction
 of
 femur
 fracture
 has
 not
 been
demonstrated
 so
 far.45,46
An
 important
 question
 is
 whether
 the
 prior
 antiresorp-
tive
 treatment
 modiﬁes
 the
 anabolic
 response
 to
 teriparatide.
The
 beneﬁts
 of
 teriparatide
 in
 patients
 previously
 exposed
 to
antiresorptive
 drugs
 over
 long
 periods
 of
 time
 were
 tested
 by
some
 authors.47–52
Ettinger
 et
 al.47 studied
 the
 effect
 of
 18
 months
 of
 teri-
paratide
 in
 women previously
 treated
 with
 raloxifene
 or
alendronate
 for
 a
 period
 of
 18–36
 months
 (EUROFORS
 study,
n
 =
 59,
 age
 60–87
 years,
 T-score
 ≤
 −2.0).
 Both
 groups
 showed
a
 statistically
 signiﬁcant
 increase
 in
 bone
 turnover
 markers
(BTM)
 (P1NP,
 bone
 FA
 and
 osteocalcin)
 as
 early
 as
 the
 end
 of
the
 ﬁrst
 month
 of
 teriparatide,
 with
 a
 tendency
 for
 further
increase
 in
 the
 group
 previously
 treated
 with
 raloxifene.
 BMD
increase
 occurred
 earlier
 in
 raloxifene
 users,
 but
 by
 the
 end
of
 treatment
 BMD
 increase
 in
 the
 lumbar
 spine
 was observed
in
 both
 groups,
 a
 gain
 of
 10.2%
 for
 previous
 users
 of
 ralox-
ifene
 and
 of
 4.1%
 for
 previous
 users
 of
 alendronate
 (p
 <
 0.001).
However,
 BMD
 increase
 in
 total
 femur
 was
 signiﬁcant
 only
in
 previous
 users
 of
 raloxifene
 (0.5%
 in
 previous
 raloxifene
users
 and
 –
 1.8%
 in
 previous
 alendronate
 users,
 p
 =
 0.002).
 The
authors
 concluded
 that
 teriparatide
 stimulates
 bone
 turnover
in
 women
 previously
 treated
 with
 raloxifene
 or
 alendronate
for
 18–36
 months,
 although
 previous
 exposure
 to
 alendronate
slows
 skeletal
 response
 to
 teriparatide.
 This
 delayed
 effect
 on
BMD  and
 more
 limited
 response
 after
 prior
 use
 of
 bisphos-
phonates
 is
 probably
 due
 to
 the
 absence
 of
 target
 cells
 for
 the
anabolic
 effect
 of
 teriparatide.
 After
 few
 years
 of
 treatment
with
 a
 potent
 antiresorptive,
 the
 extremely
 low
 bone
 turnover
reduces
 the
 availability
 of
 pre-osteoblasts,
 osteoblasts
 and
 lin-
ing
 cells
 to
 be
 converted
 into
 osteoblasts.35,48
Investigating

 a

 of
 this
 risk
 analyzed
by
 6-month
 intervals,
 which
 remained
 evident
 even
 after
 sus-
pension
 of
 teriparatide
 (37%

 in
 fractures
 during
12–18
 months
 of
 teriparatide
 and

 during

following
 its
 suspension,
 compared
 to
 the
 initial
 6
 months
 of
this
 treatment).
In
 addition,
 clinical
 studies
 examining
 bone
 mass
 by
histomorphometry,
 high-resolution
 peripheral
 quantitative
computed
 tomography
 (HR-pQCT)
 and
 ﬁnite
 element
 anal-
ysis
 in
 HR-pQCT
 showed
 that
 the
 suppressive
 effect
 of
bisphosphonates
 may
 be
 offset
 by
 continued
 treatment
 with
teriparatide.50–52
In
 short,
 these
 studies
 show
 effective
 anabolic
 response
 to
teriparatide
 after
 previous
 treatment
 with
 bisphosphonates
for
 an
 average
 period
 of
 36
 months.
 Again,
 there
 is
 no
 evidence
of
 the
 use
 of
 teriparatide
 following
 more
 prolonged
 treatment
with
 bisphosphonates,
 as
 we
 propose
 in
 our
 therapeutic
 strat-
egy.
 There
 may
 be
 greater
 delay
 and
 more
 limited
 response
 of
BTM
 and
 BMD,
 and
 clinical
 trials
 are
 needed
 to
 evaluate
 this
therapeutic
 scenario.
 However,
 given
 the
 available
 evidence,
we
 consider
 it
 acceptable
 to
 use
 drugs
 with
 anabolic
 effect
 in
previous
 users
 of
 antiresorptives
 over
 a
 prolonged
 time
 span
that,
 after
 such
 treatment,
 persist
 with
 severe
 osteoporosis
and
 high
 risk
 of
 fracture.
Protocol
 for
 pharmacological
 treatment
 of
postmenopausal
 osteoporosis
 in
 the
 public
health
 care
 system
Alendronate
 as
 ﬁrst-line
 treatment
Due
 to
 the
 extensive
 experience
 of
 use,
 safety
 and
 anti-
fracture
 
efﬁcacy,
 
bisphosphonates
 
are
 
the
 
mainstay
 
of
osteoporosis
 treatment
 and
 should
 generally
 be
 used
 as
 drugs
of
 ﬁrst
 choice
 (Fig.
 2).
 Considering
 the
 availability
 of
 alen-
dronate
 in
 the
 Brazilian
 public
 health
 service,
 most
 patients
with
 an
 indication
 of
 pharmacological
 treatment
 should
receive
 alendronate,
 a
 priori
 for
 a
 period
 of
 ﬁve
 years,
 accord-
ing
 to
 the
 presented
 evidence.
During
 treatment,
 no
 randomized
 study
 assessed
 the
 value
of
 serial
 bone
 densitometry
 on
 the
 risk
 of
 fracture,
 but
 this
 test
can
 be
 useful
 if
 used
 correctly.53 Therefore,
 treatment
 moni-
toring
 by
 sequential
 BMD
 assessment
 is
 indicated,
 with
 bone
mass
 stability
 and
 absence
 of
 new
 fractures
 in
 major
 bone
 sites
as
 indicators
 of
 therapeutic
 success.54 In
 addition,
 demonstra-
tion
 of
 a
 cross-link
 telopeptide
 of
 type
 1
 collagen
 (CTx)
 decline
of
 25%
 from
 baseline
 levels
 after
 3–6
 months
 of
 treatment
 can
be
 used
 as
 early
 evidence
 of
 inhibition
 of
 bone
 resorption
 and
good
 therapeutic
 response.53,54
Following
 the
 ﬁrst
 5
 years
 of
 treatment,
 stopping
 alen-
dronate
 therapy
 is
 suitable
 for
 most
 patients
 and
 a
 drug
holiday
 should
 be
 considered
 with
 reassessment
 of
 fracture
risk
 after
 2
 or
 3
 years.
 However,
 women  with
 a
 femoral
T-score
 ≤
 −2.5
 should
 have
 this
 treatment
 continued,
 consid-
ering
 the
 evidence
 of
 beneﬁt
 in
 this
 subgroup
 of
 women by
FLEX
 study.33 Another
 important
 consideration
 is
 whether
the
 patient
 had
 experienced
 previous
 osteoporotic
 fractures,
especially
 in
 major
 bone
 sites.
 Since
 such
 fractures
 increase
substantially
 future
 fracture
 risk,
 these
 patients
 should
 also
have
 bisphosphonate
 treatment
 continued.
 It
 is
 worth
 consid-
ering
 that
 the
 beneﬁt
 outweighs
 the
 risk
 of
 atypical
 femoral
fractures
 in
 these
 groups
 of
 individuals,
 as
 well
 as
 the
 great
impact
 of
 an
 osteoporotic
 fracture
 on
 mortality,
 quality
 of
 life
and
 costs
 to
 the
 health
 system.55 During
 this
 prolonged
 treat-
ment
 period,
 drug
 suspension
 should
 be
 determined
 by
 the
periodic
 assessment
 of
 the
 individual
 risk
 of
 fragility
 fractures.
After
 10
 years
 using
 alendronate,
 the
 risk
 of
 osteoporotic
fracture
 should
 be
 reassessed.
 In
 view
 of
 the
 absence
 of
evidence
 for
 fracture
 reduction
 and
 safety
 beyond
 such
 a
long-term
 therapy,
 maintenance
 of
 bisphosphonate
 may
 not
be
 appropriate.
 Then,

should
 be
 considered
 and
 alendronate
 discontinued.
 However,
for
 the
 non-negligible
 percentage
 of
 women with
 persis-
tent
 high
 risk
 of
 fragility
 fractures,
 stopping
 osteoporosis
treatment
 is
 not
 advisable.
 The
 options
 are
 to
 continue
 treat-
ment
 with
 alendronate
 or
 switch
 to
 another
 anti-fracture
medication.
 At
 this
 point,
 we  propose
 a
 drug
 with
 anabolic
mechanism
 of
 action
 for
 these
 high-risk
 patients
 with
 persist-
ing
 severe
 osteoporosis,
 although
 there
 have
 not
 been
 studies
evaluating
 efﬁcacy
 of
 such
 an
 approach.
 The
 only
 anabolic
drug
 available
 in
 the
 Brazilian
 market
 is
 teriparatide,
 approved
for
 the
 treatment
 length
 of
 24
 months.
 Because
 of
 its
 high
 cost
and
 limited
 evidence
 after
 such
 a
 prolonged
 antiresorptive
treatment,
 we  suggest
 selecting
 for
 its
 use
 only
 the
 subgroup
of
 women with
 severe
 osteoporosis
 and
 higher
 risk.
The
 deﬁnition
 of
 severe
 osteoporosis
 by
 WHO
 includes
 pre-
existing
 fragility
 fractures
 in
 the
 presence
 of
 T-score
 ≤
 −2.5.
The
 risk
 of
 a
 new
 vertebral
 fracture
 is
 ﬁve
 times
 higher
 in
patients
 with
 prior
 vertebral
 fractures.56 Moreover,
 consider-
ing
 BMD
 as
 an
 important
 determinant
 of
 fracture
 risk,
 high
risk
 can
 also
 be
 arbitrarily
 deﬁned
 as
 T
 ≤
 −3.5
 score,
 even
 in
the
 absence
 of
 fractures.46
Patients
 refractory
 to
 treatment
 with
 alendronate
Some
 patients
 are
 considered
 refractory
 to
 the
 treatment
 with
alendronate,
 which
 must
 be
 veriﬁed
 by
 a
 decline
 in
 BMD
 in
at
 least
 two
 serial
 BMD
 measurements
 or
 occurrence
 of
 new
fragility
 fractures
 in
 main
 bone
 sites.54 In
 such
 cases,
 review
 of
compliance
 and
 a
 search
 for
 occult
 secondary
 causes
 of
 osteo-
porosis
 are
 mandatory.
 If
 adherence
 cannot
 be
 improved
 and
secondary
 osteoporosis
 is
 excluded,
 switching
 to
 an
 alterna-
tive
 therapy
 is
 indicated.54
Most
 clinical
 practice
 guidelines
 have
 not
 recommended
the
 measurement
 of
 BTM
 in
 the
 management
 of
 osteoporosis
largely
 because
 they
 demonstrate
 high
 degrees
 of
 pre-
analytical
 and
 analytical
 variability.57 However,
 they
 provide
a
 surrogate
 measure
 of
 the
 rate
 of
 bone
 turnover
 and
 there
is
 growing
 evidence
 that
 they
 are
 potentially
 useful
 in
 deter-
mining
 fracture
 risk
 and
 response
 to
 therapy.57 There
 is
 no
reference
 to
 support
 their
 measurement
 to
 assess
 fracture
risk
 after
 long-term
 bisphosphonate,
 but
 this
 is
 not
 the
 case.
Considering
 the
 wide
 range
 of
 quality
 of
 available
 bisphospho-
nate
 formulations
 as
 well
 as
 the
 poor
 adherence
 to
 treatment,
serum
 CTx
 levels
 may
 help
 to
 identify
 patients
 with
 high
bone
 turnover,
 in
 whom
 bisphosphonate
 is
 not
 exerting
 its
effects.
 Therefore,
 during
 bisphosphonate
 treatment,
 a
 CTx
drop
 lower
 than
 25%
 from
 baseline
 or,
 in
 the
 absence
 of
pre-treatment
 values,
 a
 CTx
 above
 the
 mean
 of
 the
 pre-
menopausal
 reference
 interval
 are
 indicative
 of
 active
 bone
reabsorption.54,58 Therefore,
 in
 this
 case
 of
 treatment
 failure
along
 with
 CTx
 exceeding
 the
 lower
 half
 of
 premenopausal
range,
 the
 transition
 to
 other
 anti-resorptive
 drugs,
 zoledronic
acid
 or
 denosumab,
 would
 be
 indicated
 due
 to
 full
 absorption
and
 greater
 anti-resorptive
 effect.
For
 patients
 who
 fail
 to
 alendronate
 despite
 adequately
suppressed
 CTx,
 we  believe
 that
 zoledronic
 acid
 might
 not
offer
 beneﬁt
 based
 on
 its
 absence
 of
 superiority
 on
 BMD
 in
women
 with
 postmenopausal
 osteoporosis
 previously
 treated
with
 alendronate,
 although
 this
 effect
 was
 demonstrated
regardless
 of
 CTx.37 Therefore,
 in
 patients
 with
 treatment
failure
 along
 with
 adequately
 suppressed
 CTx,
 we  infer
that
 denosumab
 and
 teriparatide
 may
 represent
 the
 most
appropriate
 agents.
 Once
 again,
 because
 of
 the
 high
 cost
 of
teriparatide,
 the
 most
 severe
 subgroup
 of
 women
 with
 T-
score
 ≤
 −3.5
 or
 T-score
 ≤
 −2.5
 with
 previous
 fractures
 would
also
 have
 an
 indication
 for
 teriparatide.46
Although
 it
 is
 impractical
 to
 obtain
 CTx
 levels
 routinely
 in
the
 public
 health
 system,
 we
 consider
 its
 measurement
 specif-
ically
 in
 cases
 of
 treatment
 failure
 may
 help
 clinician
 in
 the
decision
 of
 alternative
 therapy.
Use
 of
 other
 drugs
 as
 ﬁrst
 choice
Finally,
 indication
 of
 other
 drugs
 as
 ﬁrst-line
 treatment
 should
also
 be
 considered
 in
 some
 clinical
 settings.
Zoledronic
 acid,
 owing
 to
 its
 great
 efﬁcacy
 in
 reducing
 ver-
tebral,
 non-vertebral
 and
 femoral
 fractures,
 as
 well
 as
 for
 its
ease
 of
 administration
 and
 guaranteed
 absorption,
 can
 be
the
 drug
 of
 choice
 in
 all
 scenarios
 where
 bisphosphonates
are
 indicated.
 However,
 due
 to
 its
 unavailability
 in
 the
 pub-
lic
 health
 system,
 we
 can
 arbitrarily
 reserve
 it
 for
 patients
with
 contraindication
 for
 oral
 bisphosphonates,
 patients
 with
more
 severe
 esophageal
 disease
 or
 those
 with
 prior
 fractures
for
 having
 a
 higher
 risk
 of
 new
 fractures.
 It
 is
 estimated
 that
adherence
 to
 treatment
 with
 oral
 bisphosphonates
 is
 lower
than
 40%
 in
 1
 year.59
Denosumab
 is
 the
 only
 drug
 indicated
 for
 the
 treat-
ment
 of
 osteoporosis
 in
 patients
 with
 creatinine
 clearance
<30
 mL/min.
 However,
 the
 characterization
 of
 osteoporosis
 in
patients
 with
 chronic
 kidney
 disease
 is
 complex,
 requiring
the
 exclusion
 of
 renal
 osteodystrophy
 through
 laboratory
 tests
and
 often
 bone
 histomorphometry.
Raloxifene,
 a
 selective
 estrogen
 receptor
 modulator
 with
antiresorptive
 mechanism
 of
 action,
 discretely
 increases
 BMD
and
 reduces
 by
 30%
 the
 risk
 of
 vertebral
 fractures,
 not
 acting
on
 non-vertebral
 and
 femur
 fractures.60 Due
 to
 its
 lower
 efﬁ-
cacy
 in
 reducing
 fractures,
 we
 suggest
 its
 use
 in
 women with
isolated
 spinal
 osteoporosis,
 in
 perimenopausal
 age.
Finally,
 given
 the
 fast
 improvement
 in
 bone
 mass
 and
 archi-
tecture
 seen
 in
 response
 to
 teriparatide,
 this
 drug
 could
 be
indicated
 as
 ﬁrst-line
 therapy
 in
 individuals
 at
 particularly
high-risk
 for
 fractures,
 which
 includes
 the
 same
 more
 severe
subgroup
 of
 women with
 T-score
 ≤
 −3.5
 or
 T-score
 ≤
 −2.5
 with
pre-existing
 fractures.
However,
 it
 should
 be
 noted
 that
 there
 is
 an
 intersec-
tion
 in
 the
 indications
 of
 teriparatide
 and
 zoledronic
 acid
 as
ﬁrst-line
 agents
 in
 this
 proposal,
 concerning
 to
 women
 with
pre-existing
 osteoporotic
 fractures.
 So,
 considering
 that
 the
beneﬁt
 of
 teriparatide
 in
 reducing
 the
 risks
 of
 vertebral
 and
nonvertebral
 fractures
 was
 best
 demonstrated
 in
 women
 over
65
 years
 with
 prevalent
 vertebral
 fractures,45 as
 well
 as
 consid-
ering
 the
 greater
 risk
 attributed
 to
 aging,
 we
 advocate
 its
 use
 as
ﬁrst-line
 therapy
 for
 this
 group
 of
 patients
 over
 age
 65
 with
 at
least
 two
 pre-existing
 vertebral
 fractures,
 in
 view
 of
 its
 much
higher
 cost.
 Regarding
 to
 the
 other
 suggested
 indication
 of
teriparatide
 for
 women  with
 very
 low
 BMD
 in
 the
 absence
of
 pre-existing
 fractures,
 we
 believe
 that
 the
 risk
 of
 an
 inad-
equate
 response
 to
 antiresorptive
 therapy
 is
 high
 when
 the
skeletal
 architecture
 is
 too
 severely
 disrupted
 and
 the
 remod-
eling
 spaces
 are
 scarce.61 Once
 more,

high
 cost,
 we  arbitrarily
 relocate
 its
 use
 as
 initial
 therapy
 in
 the
group
 of
 women with
 very
 low
 BMD
 without
 previous
 fractures
to
 those
 with
 T-score
 ≤
 −4.0.
Conclusion
In
 conclusion,
 alendronate
 is
 an
 appropriate
 ﬁrst-line
 drug
to
 be
 used
 for
 a
 period
 of
 ﬁve
 years,
 with
 recommended
extension
 for
 patients
 with
 persistent
 femoral
 T-score
 ≤
 −2.5
and
 for
 those
 with
 previous
 fragility
 fractures.
 After
 10
 years
of
 bisphosphonate
 treatment,
 there
 have
 not
 been
 clini-
cal
 studies
 evaluating
 different
 approaches.
 At
 this
 time,
 a
drug
 with
 anabolic
 mechanism
 of
 action
 may
 be
 appropriate
for
 the
 high-risk
 patients
 with
 persistent
 severe
 osteoporo-
sis.
 Furthermore,
 drugs
 as
 denosumab,
 zoledronic
 acid
 and
teriparatide
 are
 options
 in
 cases
 of
 refractoriness
 to
 oral
 bis-
phosphonates
 as
 well
 as
 ﬁrst-line
 therapy
 in
 speciﬁc
 clinical
settings.
It
 is
 important
 to
 mention
 that
 currently,
 in
 view
 of
 the
limited
 evidence,
 we
 do
 not
 have
 answers
 to
 many
 of
 our
 clin-
ical
 questions,
 but
 we
 take
 advantage
 of
 the
 best
 scientiﬁc
knowledge
 available
 to
 propose
 criteria
 for
 the
 rational
 use
 of
pharmacological
 treatment
 of
 postmenopausal
 osteoporosis
in
 the
 sphere
 of
 public
 health.

This paper adopts a novel learning perspective on information systems
development. Building on the works of Anselm Strauss we conceptu-
alize development processes as “negotiated orders” where members
from different “social worlds” encounter and negotiate differences and
tensions. We argue that processes of inquiry and action are interwoven,
and this is what facilitates and stimulates learning. Based on a case study
where different versions of open source software were customized,
further developed and implemented in the Ethiopian public health care
system, this paper explores the interplay between participation, politics
and learning in IS implementation and use. We consider learning to be
an integral part of the social practice, and it occurs mainly through
encounters and negotiations between actors from different social
worlds who might have competing interests and values. The paper
also analyzed how the software in question functioned as a boundary
object, not just in the traditional sense by facilitating cooperation
among these actors. An even more signiﬁcant role of the boundary
object was in bringing the existing differences to the foreground and
thus stimulating negotiations and learning. As such, this paper
contributes to three discourses: organizational learning, boundary
objects and health information systems in developing countries in
particular and more speciﬁcally to IS implementation in settings with
scarce resources, heterogeneous stakeholders, and diverse interests.

1. Introduction
The key motivation for this paper is to contribute to our understanding of learning in systems
development and implementation processes. Concretely we explore the process of learning that happened
through action and participation of stakeholders from different social worlds1 in designing and
implementing computer-based information systems (IS) in the context of developing countries. Drawing
on empirical material from the implementation of two different versions of the District Health Information
System (DHIS) in the public health sector in Ethiopia, the paper reveals that the process of adapting and
implementing information systems (IS) in public sector organizations of developing countries is in fact a
complex process of change that requires signiﬁcant amounts of learning.
The complexity is related to the socio-political and economic contexts of the public health care sector
of most developing countries. Especially in the Sub-Saharan African countries the sector is extremely
marginalized both in terms of infrastructure and manpower. Mosse and Sahay (2005) identiﬁed four
adverse conditions impeding the introduction of computer-based HIS in such contexts, namely:
inadequate resources, overworked health workers, the policies of international agencies that tend to
favor disease-speciﬁc rather than generic programs, and the centralized structure of the health
administration. Nhampossa (2005) criticized the widespread “technological transfer” approach to
technology introduction, since it doesn't take into account local adaptation and local learning. He further
noted that in practice, “transferring an application focused technology and related knowledge becomes
problematic, since it involves contextual and cultural elements such as language and meanings, which
cannot be transferred, but rather need to be learnt and built locally” (Nhampossa, 2005, pp. 29). The
complexity of the context also involves the existence of diverse stakeholders with multiple and conﬂicting
interests, such as donor organizations that relate to their home constituencies, and an institutional context
with complex structure, different cultural values and varying power dynamics. As Braa, Monteiro, and
Sahay (2004) indicated, the public health care sector of developing countries is inherently politicized, and
introducing technologies that would make health information more visible and accessible to end users and
managers may inﬂuence the interests of different stakeholders such as donor agencies, health activists,
nongovernmental organizations, vendors, consultants, and politicians who have different agendas and
possibly competing interests.
Thus, the challenge is on one hand how to shape and adapt a given technology to ﬁt to a particular local
context and make it work over time with severe resource constraints. On the other hand, the presence of
numerous stakeholders with different agendas and possibly competing interests and values needs to be
dealt with. We propose that in order to understand and deal with such processes, we need an
understanding of systems development that gives emphasis not only to the need for learning in terms of
adaptation and contextualization of design, but also to the need to deal with the politicized context in
which this occurs. This will require that systems development is organized as an on-going process of
negotiation and compromises to support collaboration, mutual learning, and partnership among
heterogeneous stakeholders (e.g. managers, healthcare personnel, and technological vendors) at different
levels with varying knowledge, expertise, interests, and resources.
The nature and challenges of such a process are what we will analyze in this paper. Based on a case
study where different versions of an open source software were customized, further developed and
implemented in the Ethiopian public health care system, this paper analyzes how learning occurred in
processes of encounters and negotiations between actors from different social worlds, both from the
public health and the information systems (IS) domains. As such, our focus is to explore how learning and
participation play out in a context where actors from different organizational contexts need to agree on
systems design, adaptation and implementation issues. While the topics of learning and user participation
are well-researched in IS research (see for example He, 2004; Lyytinen, 1987; Newman & Noble, 1990;
Robey, Boudreau, & Rose, 2000; Zhong & Majchrzak, 2004), however, much of it has addressed these topics
within a context of traditional systems development projects, where one organization assigns a
development task to systems development professionals.
1 Social worlds are “groups with shared commitments to the pursuit of a common task, who develop ideologies to deﬁne their work and
who accumulate diverse resources needed to get the job done” (Gieryn, 1995, pp. 412).

The case here differs along multiple dimensions: in this case the task was to customize an already
developed software which was developed as free and open source software (FOSS), which requires the
build-up of a strong local community linked to a globally shared development and support network. The
non-Western technological and organizational context poses different conditions for how well known
models of organizing user participation should be implemented (Kimaro & Titlesatd, 2005; Lungo, 2008;
Puri et al., 2004). Finally the research location being Africa's second most populous country with strategic
importance on the Horn of Africa had strong implications for the presence of stakeholders and their
investments in the context.
In this paper, therefore, we propose to conceptualize the learning process associated with systems
implementation differently. Our argument is that learning is not a conﬂict free process as it tends to
be treated both in cognitive based and practice oriented learning theories (Argyris & Schön, 1978;
Brown & Duguid, 1991; Cook & Yanow, 1993; Gherardi, 2006; Huber, 1991; Lave & Wenger, 1991;
March, 1991). Rather, we embrace Contu and Willmot's (2003) viewpoint that learning processes are
shaped, enabled and constrained by their embeddedness in power relations. By adopting this
perspective, we conceptualize learning processes as integral to social practice which involves
both participation and the exercise of power and control (Contu & Willmot, 2003, pp. 6). This
understanding of learning as integral part of practice and power relations underpins our interest of
exploring the dynamics of learning in adapting and implementing computer-based HIS in the context
of developing countries.
To understand this process in more detail, we draw on the concepts of social worlds, boundary objects,
and negotiated order from the literature of symbolic interactionism (Clarke, 1991; Clarke & Star, 2008;
Mark & Poltrock, 2004; Strauss, 1978, 1982). The social worlds perspective is a well-established and rich
sociological tradition to investigate and analyze the politics of socio-technical change (Garrety & Badham,
2000; Strauss, 1993). As such, the social worlds perspective provides rich analytical insight to study
learning as a social practice that involves participation of different actors, and which is often triggered by
tensions, conﬂicts, and organizational power dynamics.
We describe the development, customization, and implementation between 2004 and 2007 of the
District Health Information System (DHIS) software by the Ethiopian branch of the global Health
Information Systems Program (HISP)2 network. In analyzing this case we address the following research
questions:
• What characterized the learning processes in implementing computer-based health information system
(HIS) in the context of the Ethiopian public health system?
• What were the challenges encountered at different stages of the implementation process?
• How have those challenges been mediated and negotiated over time?
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides a review of literature on IS research on
learning and user participation. Section 3 addresses the theoretical framework by highlighting the notions
of social worlds, boundary objects and negotiated order. Section 4 introduces the research setting,
research approach and method of data collection and analysis. The ﬁfth section provides an account of the
case description on the process of developing, customizing and implementing two distinct versions of
DHIS software in Ethiopia. Section 6 presents the analysis and discussion, and the last section provides
concluding remarks and implications of the study.
2. IS research on learning and user participation
In this section, we review IS literature on user participation and learning in the context of systems
development and implementation. We identify a lack of emphasis on how organizational and global
politics shape and inﬂuence the processes of learning and participation in general and in particular with
respect to the context of developing countries.

2.1. Learning within and beyond the systems development process
The implementation of new information systems in organizations has been recognized as an
intervention that can induce organizational change (Orlikowski & Robey, 1991). As change occurs,
organizations need to learn in order to achieve anticipated change beneﬁts (Gregor, Martin, Fernandez,
Stern, & Vitale, 2006; Robey & Sahay, 1996). Information systems (IS) are designed and implemented to
enable more effective operational practices (Wastell, 1999) — a process that both requires and is supposed
to lead to organizational learning.
As such, the IS ﬁeld has long recognized the learning challenges that are encountered, both within the
systems development process itself and after adoption and implementation in the organization (Lyytinen
& Robey, 1999; Mathiassen & Pedersen, 2005; Robey et al., 2000; Wastell, 1999). Robey et al. (2000)
identiﬁed two streams of research on information technology and organizational learning: “studies that
apply organizational learning concepts to the process of implementing and using information technology
in organizations; and studies concerned with the design of information technology applications to support
organizational learning” (Robey et al., 2000, pp. 2). In this review, our focus is on the ﬁrst stream of
research as our focus is to understand learning processes in adapting, implementing and using IT-based
systems in the context of developing countries.
Several scholars including Curtis, Krasner, and Iscoe (1988), He (2004), Lyytinen (1987), Majchrzak
and Beath (2000), Newman and Noble (1990), Robey et al. (2000) and Zhong and Majchrzak (2004)
studied IS implementation as learning, communication, and negotiation process. Although other factors
(such as organizational culture, structure, politics, management support, and availability of resources) had
an impact in successfully implementing IS projects, learning through participation is critical to the success
or failure of an IS implementation initiative (Majchrzak & Beath, 2000; Wastell, 1999). This indicates that
the work of IS development, adaptation and implementation inevitably requires different stakeholder
groups to work together to discuss, negotiate, and interact on what they are building and on how they
coordinate their activities.
Systems development and implementation, as such, is a mutual learning process whereby systems
developers learn about the non-technical context and future users learn about the features and
functionalities of the technology, a task which requires effective communication (Curtis et al., 1988;
Zhong & Majchrzak, 2004). Systems developers need to develop a thorough understanding of the business
domain, and the users need to be able to reﬂect on current work practices and to develop an
understanding of the potentials of technology to transform how work is done (Wastell, 1999). Such a
mutual learning process requires that both domain experts (users) and technologists (developers)
recognize each other's distinctive capabilities and views (Boland, 1978), and many IS researchers have
focused on how to create a well-working user–developer environment and ensure knowledge sharing and
communication between users and developers (e.g. Bratteteig, 1997, 2003; Mathiassen & Pedersen, 2005;
Scott & Vessey, 2000).
In addition, learning happens also after the adoption and implementation of the IS, i.e. during the
assimilation and adaptation process when the organization seeks to realize beneﬁts. Adaptable,
extendable and tailorable technologies allow learning to extend beyond the design phase. This stream of
research is particularly relevant for the context of developing countries, since most information systems,
as well as IS practices, methodologies, and competencies are initially developed in Western contexts and
require context-sensitive adaptations.
In the context of developing countries, some scholars noted the importance of learning in the process
of appropriating, adapting and implementing technologies to ﬁt to the local context. For example, Braa
(1997, pp. 142) argued that the challenge for successful adoption of new technologies in the context of
developing countries is: “learning to master IT in its own environment”, and Heeks (2002) emphasized
that capacity and opportunity for local improvisations were crucial for overcoming the ‘design-reality’
gaps. Similarly, Braa, Monteiro, Sahay, Staring, and Titlestad (2007, pp. 1–2) underscored the importance
of the “local process of learning, improvisation and tinkering” in order to achieve sustainable IS design,
development and implementation. However, understanding the dynamics of learning and participation to
successfully adapt and implement new information systems in developing countries has received
relatively little focus in IS research. Therefore this study aims to present an analysis of how learning
processes evolve through participation, partnership and negotiation between different stakeholders.

2.2. Learning and user participation
While there is an early recognition that IS development is not a purely rational exercise, but steeped in
organizational politics (Franz & Robey, 1984), these aspects are to a smaller degree reﬂected in the IS
research on learning and participation. Along with the deployment of computerized information systems
in organizations, a strong research stream on participatory design emerged (Bjerknes & Brattetieg, 1995;
Ehn & Kyng, 1987; Kensing, Simonson, & Bødker, 1998; Puri et al., 2004). Concerns about automation
leading to de-skilling, as well as ideals of workplace democracy fuelled this debate (Bansler, 1998; Kyng &
Mathiassen, 1997); thus this research stream has an explicit interest in the “politics of design” (Kensing &
Blomberg, 1998). In addition to exploring concrete tools and methods, it has fostered a critical awareness
of questions relating to user participation and inﬂuence.
However, as it is pursued in practice, user participation may be motivated by different ideals; at least
three are suggested by Bjerknes and Brattetieg (1995): First, the need to involve users in order to acquire
relevant knowledge for designing well working systems, second, to create realistic expectations and
reduce resistance to implementation, and third, an explicit ideological aim of increasing workplace
democracy, which has been representative for the Scandinavian tradition.
However, attempts to apply the approaches of user participation in developing countries have
demonstrated signiﬁcantly different preconditions, for instance in terms of the general technological
knowledge level and democratic traditions. IS researchers from the developing world have emphasized
that although participatory design is a learning process in which technologists and end-users learn from
each other; they suggested differing types and degrees of participation (see Braa & Hedberg, 2002; Braa,
Monteiro, & Reinert, 1995; Braa et al., 2004; Kimaro & Titlesatd, 2005; Lungo, 2008; Mursu, Soriyan,
Olufokunbi, & Korpela, 2000; Puri et al., 2004). Puri et al. (2004), for example, argued for the contextual
adaptation of the participatory approach and the techniques employed; and claim that there is no single
best practice that is universally applicable. They rather argued that the politics of design, the nature of
participation, and the methods, tools and techniques for carrying out IS implementation projects are
shaped with respect to the diversity of the socio-economic, cultural and political situations faced in each
speciﬁc context (Puri et al., 2004, pp. 42).
Mursu et al. (2000) also emphasized contextual considerations that should be taken into account — like
sustainability, affordability, socio-economic justiﬁcation and community participation. Especially, in the African
context the principle of participation in IS implementation needs to reach further than just workplace democracy
(Mursu et al., 2000). It rather needs to focus on community participation and empowering deprived
communities through learning, since the survival of the IS depends on how ready the community is to embrace
the change brought by the new IS (Braa, 1996; Braa & Hedberg, 2002; Mursu et al., 2000).
Lungo (2008) also underscored the need for participation and learning in bridging the gap between global
and local developers in the context of adapting and implementing FOSS in the Tanzanian public health care
system. Considering the different cultures and experiences between global and local developers, Lungo argued
that the two group of actors should come together as in jamaa, that is “sharing their software and knowledge for
mutual beneﬁt”, drawing inspiration from the Ujamaa policy introduced by Tanzania's founding father Julius
Nyerere (Lungo, 2008, pp. 107). He further argued that, in the course of such partnership and collaboration
between the local and global developers, learning occurs especially through sharing source code and
programming techniques. Similarly, Kimaro and Titlesatd (2005) suggested that emphasis should be put on
“participatory customization” rather than design from scratch in the context of open source software adoption in
Africa. Both underscored the need for capacity building and local adaptation as crucial elements of learning and
participation in IS design, adaptation, implementation and use.
From this review, we conclude that, while the importance of learning and participation has been
demonstrated and learning and participation are considered valuable components of IS implementation process,
understanding their role in developing country contexts requires a shift in theorizing. Rather than isolating
learning from political processes of IS development and implementation, more attention should be directed
toward their interplay. Theory should recognize that learning and power relationships operate together, insofar
as power relations underlie community-based learning (Contu & Willmot, 2003).
To understand the interplay between learning, participation and power relations in adapting and
implementing IS that happens in a network of diverse local and global stakeholders, we draw on the
concepts of social worlds, boundary objects, and negotiated order from the literature of symbolic
237
S.A. Mengiste, M. Aanestad / Information and Organization 23 (2013) 233–257
interactionism (Clarke, 1991; Clarke & Star, 2008; Strauss, 1978). Concepts such as social worlds,
boundary objects and negotiated order have greater potential to help us explore the dynamic and
complex socio-political processes of learning during adaptation and implementation of information
systems. Besides, these concepts also help us to view the adaptation and implementation of
comport-based HIS in the context of developing countries as intertwined and on-going technical and
social negotiation process between heterogeneous social worlds. Thus we can challenge the view that
technology transfer and diffusion of innovation are linear and well-planned processes, as are often
depicted in the IS literature. These theoretical resources will be presented in the next section.
3. Social worlds, boundary objects, and negotiated order
The concept of ‘social worlds’ has its roots in the American sociological tradition of symbolic interactionism
(Shibutani, 1955; Strauss, 1978; Unruh, 1980) which primarily focuses on meaning construction “amongst
groups of actors – collectives of various sorts – and on collective action — people doing things together and
working with shared objects” (Clarke & Star, 2008, pp. 113). The emphasis on the creation of meanings through
interaction has strong parallels with the social construction of technology (SCOT) approach that is pioneered by
Bijker, Hughes, and Pinch (1987). The key argument in both symbolic interactionism and social construction of
technology is that the development of technological artifacts is not a pre-ordained process that is propelled by
the inherent efﬁciency of the technology itself; it is rather an outcome of complex social and political
negotiations (Garrety & Badham, 2000).
The notion of social worlds as groups with shared commitments to the pursuit of common task implies
“amorphous and diffuse constellations of actors, organizations, events and practices, which have coalesced
into spheres of interest and involvement for participants” (Unruh, 1980, pp. 277), and without a powerful
centralized structure of authority (Unruh, 1980). According to Strauss (1978), social worlds are not
bounded by geography or formal membership, but by the limits of effective communication and
commitment. This limit can be, for example, technological whereby people can form a social world with
others they can reach via some medium of communication (such as groupware technologies or social
media). The limit can also be ontological or lexical, i.e., people can only communicate effectively when
they share a common language and understand what it is each other is saying (Clarke & Star, 2008). Social
worlds are also characterized by a commitment to common assumptions about what is important, and
what should be done. For example, a task force, an academic department, a distributed project team, or a
recreation group that shares perspectives and meaning forms the basis for collective action (Clarke &
Star, 2008). Here, “various issues are debated, negotiated, fought out, forced and manipulated by
representatives” of the participating social worlds (Strauss, 1991, pp. 239). Social worlds could be studied
and analyzed at any scale, “from smallest (say local world, on local space) to the very largest (in size or
geographic spread)” (Strauss, 1991, pp. 421).
Another important concept introduced by the social worlds perspective is the notion of arena. An arena
is a ﬁeld of action and interaction among a potentially wide variety of collective actors (be it human,
organizational or technical artifacts). In arena, the different social worlds that focus on a given issue and
prepared to act in some way are brought together (Strauss, 1978, 1991).
Gieryn (1995) also identiﬁed three important properties that are common to all social worlds: the
potential for division and segmentation into sub-worlds; intersection with other social worlds; and
legitimization through the deﬁnition and enforcement of standards and boundaries of a social world.
Every complex social world characteristically has segments, subdivisions or sub-worlds, shifting as
patterns in commitment alter, reorganize, and realign. Over time, social worlds typically segment into
multiple worlds (sub-worlds), intersect and merge with other worlds in which they share commitments,
interests and values (Clarke & Star, 2008).
But the question is, how do diverse, bounded social worlds come together to collaborate and achieve
some desired goals? With regard to this question, Star and Griesemer (1989) use the concept of
“boundary objects” to explain things that exist at the junctures where different social worlds meet in an
arena of mutual concern. Star and Griesemer (1989) argued that, certain boundary objects are ﬂexible
enough to accommodate different interpretations or interests emanating from various distinct social
worlds, yet robust and plastic enough to maintain a common identity across all social contexts, thus
238
S.A. Mengiste, M. Aanestad / Information and Organization 23 (2013) 233–257
allowing translation to take place across the boundary. Gal, Yoo, and Boland (2004) describe boundary
objects as:
“… abstract or physical artefacts which reside in the interfaces between organizations or social
communities and have the capacity to bridge perceptual and practical differences among diverse
communities in order to reach common understandings and effective cooperation” (Gal et al., 2004,
pp. 194).
Boundary objects, therefore, serve as intermediaries (interfaces) between multiple social worlds and
facilitate the interaction, communication and ﬂow of information, concepts, skills, and materials between
diverse social actors (Fujimura, 1992, Roth & McGinn, 1998). The notion of boundary objects has been
applied to denote different things including physical product or prototypes (e.g. Bechky, 2003; Carlile,
2002), design drawings (Bødker, 1998), shared IS (Briers & Chua, 2001; Pawlowski & Robey, 2004),
engineering sketches (Henderson, 1998), and standardized reporting forms (Bowker, Timmermans, &
Star, 1995; Briers & Chua, 2001).
Clarke (1991) pointed out that the process of developing and adapting boundary objects (such as technical
artifacts or standards) through the actions and interactions of stakeholders from different social worlds, “is
fundamentally an exercise of negotiated order and a robust boundary object achieves this status by satisfying
both the particular, local demands of users and the wide arena demands of all the worlds involved” (Clarke, 1991,
pp. 134). The term “negotiated order” was introduced in the literature by Strauss et al. (1963) “as a way of
conceptualizing the ordered ﬂux they found in their studies of two psychiatric hospitals” (Maines, 1982, pp. 269).
The notion of negotiated order as it is used in sociological studies (Clarke, 1991; Strauss, 1978, 1991) provides
a useful analytical insight to understand on-going negotiations between different actors, the negotiation context
and how social orders and structures emerge as a result of the give-and-take interactions of different
stakeholders (Clarke, 1991). Strauss et al. (1963) emphasized that, ambiguities inherent in different
organizational contexts, require negotiations, either explicit or implicit, as negotiations were seen as essential
to understand both stability and change. In his book entitled “Negotiations” (1978), Strauss provides more
elaboration and speciﬁcation on the notion of negotiated order. He argued, “as social orders are in some way
negotiated orders, understanding negotiating processes and their bearing on social orders might well provide
important insights into how social orders are maintained, how they change, and how structural limitations
interact with the capacity of humans to reconstruct their worlds creatively” (Strauss et al., 1963, pp. 101).
Through negotiated order, participants in social worlds generate, adopt, or adapt new standards, tools,
technologies, ideologies and work practices. As such, the notion of negotiated order helps to understand that
social structures and systems are products of human agency and a conditioning factor for the interplay between
different social actors with overlapping and competing interests (Fine, 1984; Strauss, 1978). This interplay
between human and institutional actors from different social worlds is an on-going process of negotiation
involving issues of varying clarity and complexity (Modell, 2006). Through these on-going negotiations and
re-negotiations, new organizational practices, standards, rules and norms will emerge. In line with this, Modell
(2006) argued that “what are considered institutional rules at any speciﬁc point in time may be viewed as a
product of past negotiations whilst these may be re-negotiated if the negotiation context is amenable to change”
(Modell, 2006, pp. 222).
We argue that investigating the trajectories of information systems development and implementation
in different organizational contexts can be assisted by an analysis of the social worlds involved, the
negotiations that ensue among the worlds as the new system evolves, and the boundary objects and
boundary spanners used to mediate negotiations. In this paper, therefore, we explore the dynamics of
learning through negotiation and participation in the process of developing, adapting and implementing
computerized HIS in public health institutions of a developing country.
4. Research setting, approach & methods
4.1. Research setting
The empirical setting for this research is Ethiopia which is a low income country located in the north
eastern part of Africa with a total area of 1.1 million km2. Ethiopia is Africa's second most populous
239
S.A. Mengiste, M. Aanestad / Information and Organization 23 (2013) 233–257
country with an estimated total population of 79.1 million; of which more than 85% lives in rural areas
(CSA, 20083). Politically, the country is a federation of nine National Regional States and two city
administrations. These states are further divided into sixty-ﬁve zones, ﬁve hundred twenty-three districts
(‘woredas’) and around 10,000 ‘kebeles’ (the lowest administrative unit) (HSDP III, 2005/06–2009/104).
The public health care system in Ethiopia comprises the Federal Ministry of Health, Regional Health
Bureaus, Zonal Health Departments, District (Woreda) Health Ofﬁces, and health facilities. The health
delivery system is highly centralized at the national and regional levels with little room for decision
making at Woreda and health facility levels. The healthcare is also delivered in a fragmented way, relying
on disease-speciﬁc, so-called vertical programs.
The national Health Information System (HIS) is also poorly organized and un-standardized in the
Ethiopian public health care system. As per a report made by HSDP (2005/06–2009/10), HIS functions in a
top-down fashion, implying that while planning and implementation of health systems are done at the
level of the Federal Ministry of Health (FMoH), health data is collected using paper form at health facility
level and sent up to the district, zone, region and ministry. The devolution of power from the FMoH to the
Regional Health Bureaus (RHBs) resulted in the emergence of different HIS in different regions. The HSDP
III (2005/06–2009/10) reported that more than 150 HIS reporting formats that did not conform to the
reporting formats of other regions were identiﬁed in one of the regional states.
This study was conducted within the framework of the global Health Information System Program
(HISP) (see Braa, Hanseth, et al., 2007; Braa & Hedberg, 2002; Braa, Monteiro, et al., 2007; Braa et al., 2004)
which started in South Africa in 1994 as a collaborative action research project between the University of
Oslo, Norway and University of Western Cape, South Africa. The aim of HISP is mainly to strengthen the
process of designing and implementing effective health information systems (HIS) in developing
countries.
The ﬁrst version of the District Health information Software (DHIS) was developed in 1994 by the HISP
team in South Africa as a tool to support the management of routine health data. Over the years, the
software has been customized and implemented in many African and Asian countries including: India,
Mozambique, Malawi, Tanzania, Sierra Leone, Botswana and Ghana. In this paper, we describe the process
of introducing DHIS in Ethiopia with an emphasis on the activities in Addis Ababa in the period between
2003 and 2005, as well as the further expansion to other regions and the migration to a new version (DHIS
2.05) happening in 2006–2007.
4.2. Research approach
This study employed a qualitative research approach, based in the interpretative tradition (Walsham,
1993, 2006), which seeks to understand complex social, technological and organizational issues related to
the development, customization, and implementation of information systems in different contexts. As
Walsham (1993) pointed out, interpretive research is “aimed at producing an understanding of the
context of the information system, and the process whereby the information system inﬂuences and is
inﬂuenced by the context” (Walsham, 1993, pp. 4–5). Our research was also informed by the set of
principles developed by Klein and Myers (1999) for conducting and evaluating interpretive IS research.
For instance, according to the principle of interaction between the researcher(s) and subjects, “the facts
are produced as part and parcel of the social interaction of the researchers with the participants” (Klein &
Myers, 1999, pp. 74). Our project has been an action research project, and our involvement in the domain
as supporters of the software projects enabled us a unique access to the processes and rich contextual
exposure. However, our relation to the other stakeholders was one of project partners, not independent
researchers in an observation role, and as such our study cannot be construed as ‘objective’. Moreover, our
understanding and conceptualizations of this experience have also been iteratively developing according
to Klein and Myers' basic principle of the hermeneutic circle, during the time that has elapsed since our
involvement.

The study has relied on multiple sources for empirical material. While the overall HISP project
understood itself as an action research project, we chose to not frame this study in that way, since we did
not apply the procedures of an action research in presenting and analyzing our ﬁndings. The empirical
data presented here was collected by the ﬁrst author who is an Ethiopian national and a member of the
HISP-Ethiopia development and implementation team. As a member of the HISP-Ethiopia team, he had a
role of participant observer, as he had inﬂuenced the change initiative by taking part in situational
analysis, customization, implementation, and capacity building activities in different regions and at
different administrative levels since the inception of the project in Ethiopia in 2003. The second author is a
member of the larger HISP program based in Oslo. While she visited HISP Ethiopia several times and took
part in a few workshops and interviews, she has more the role of a semi-external observer as she was not
deeply involved in inﬂuencing the change process at a local level.
4.3. Data collection methods
Apart from the knowledge and experience gained from the ﬁrst authors' long term involvement in the
project, the empirical material for this speciﬁc study was also collected through semi-structured
interviews, observation during meetings, workshops, document analysis and analysis of e-mails
communicated through group mailing lists.
4.3.1. Interviews
Interviews were conducted with six HISP-Ethiopia team members, three developers from Oslo and
Vietnam, and seven end users of DHIS 1.3 software in Addis Ababa Health Bureau. Open-ended questions
were asked during the semi-structured interview sessions. Some questions were more speciﬁcally
structured to reﬂect the learning aspect and the experiences acquired during the customization,
implementation and use of the computerized HIS in the Ethiopian context. Besides, participation in the
frequent and informal group discussions (during lunch and coffee sessions) with the local development
team members was consciously used to explore their learning experiences and to investigate the problems
they encountered in the process.
4.3.2. Participant observation in meetings and workshops
As an active member of the HISP-Ethiopia project team, the ﬁrst author took part in different
meetings, discussions and workshops held with different stakeholders at national, regional, zonal and
district levels that were held to discuss, negotiate and change the existing routine paper-based HIS at
different levels of the public health care system in Ethiopia. The issues raised and discussed during
those meetings and workshops were used as important sources ﬁrst-hand information from the
different groups with varying interests and used in this paper. During those sessions notes were taken
which were summarized and rewritten later. The ﬁrst author was involved in user training programs on
the basics of computers and the application software (DHIS 1.3) that was conducted in June and July
2004 in Addis Ababa and Benishangul-Gumuz respectively, and on DHIS 1.4 in Amhara regional state in
May 2006. These activities also provided useful information about the challenges of changing the
existing routine paper-based system as well as the power relations between different stakeholders and
the learning experiences about the new system (DHIS) and the new data collection and reporting tools
developed.
4.3.3. Document analysis
Analysis of existing documents (both printed and electronic) was another source of information. The
relevant documents included strategic plans (HSDP III, 2005/06), public reports, and the formal
“Memorandum of Understanding” documents with the involved partners. These documents were
reviewed and helped to identify major events, historical decisions made and key actors and their roles.
Of speciﬁc interest for this study is the archive of electronic mail messages on the HISP Ethiopia mailing
list, as well as other relevant lists (there are several mailing lists within HISP). These email messages
reﬂected the discussions and debates within the HISP team, both nationally and globally.

4.4. Data analysis
The analysis of our empirical data was inspired by established methods for handling qualitative data
(Miles & Huberman, 1994). To begin with, we read through the transcribed interviews and the collected
documents to provide an overview of the empirical material. The next step was more directly linked to our
research questions. We began by careful analysis and reﬂection of the data regarding the broader
institutional context and its implication on the introduction of a new information system in the public
health sector of Ethiopia.
Then we focused on an organizational level analysis by identifying the chronology of emergence of
themes, concepts, and issues. These were related to: the adoption and implementation of DHIS 1.3 in
Addis Ababa City government and beyond; the development and customization of new version of
DHIS software (version 2.0); and the complex and dynamic interaction of different stakeholders
during the entire process of adoption, customization, implementation and use. The theoretical
apparatus, which embraced the notions of social world, boundary objects, and negotiated order had
been used to inform the analysis and thereby served as a sensitizing device (Patton, 2002; Walsham,
1993) for what ‘to look for’ in the data. For example, the social world's perspective provided a useful
way of mapping an important part of the heterogeneous actors and the different social worlds and
sub-worlds participating in the process of developing, customizing, and implementing different
versions of the DHIS software in the Ethiopian context. The notions of negotiated order also helped us
to analyze the empirical ﬁndings with an attention to tensions and conﬂicts that triggered learning
among different stakeholders within and between different social worlds and sub-worlds. We also
used the notion of boundary objects to structure and analyze our ﬁndings in terms of how technical
artifacts (such as the DHIS software) helped to mediate the interaction and negotiation of different
stakeholders.
5. Introducing DHIS in the Ethiopian healthcare systems
In this section we present and analyze the ﬁndings of the case study. Section 5.1 describes the different
phases of introducing DHIS in the Addis Ababa Health Bureau during the period between 2003 and 2005,
and our focus here is on the negotiations between different social worlds (i.e. the IS and the public health
worlds). Section 5.2 provides an account of the negotiations that occurred during the development and
customization of a new version of open source and platform independent software called DHIS 2.0 in the
period between 2006 and 2007.
5.1. Introducing DHIS 1.3 in Addis Ababa
The HISP initiative in Ethiopia dates back to early 2003 as a collaborative research project between the
Department of Information Science at Addis Ababa University and the Department of Informatics at the
University of Oslo, Norway. A local HISP Ethiopia team (administratively belonging to Addis Ababa
University) of 3 PhD students and 5 Master's students were created, and members from this team
performed a situation analysis on the country's existing HIS during May to August 2003. As none of the
team members had speciﬁc knowledge about the healthcare domain (e.g. about the organization of health
programs and services, data elements, indicators, reports, and work practices), conducting the situation
analysis was not only a fact-ﬁnding mission but also a learning opportunity for the team itself. Initially, the
local HISP team sought formal approval from the Ethiopian Federal Ministry of Health, but this effort failed
as the Ministry was not interested to collaborate with HISP. The authorities in the Planning and
Programming Department of the ministry (which was responsible for the Health Management IS) insisted
that the design and implementation of a computerized HMIS would be carried out by their own experts,
and their priority at that time was the development of a national HMIS strategy. As a result, collaboration
was instead established with the relatively autonomous regional health bureaus, starting with Addis
Ababa Health Bureau (AAHB) where an agreement was signed in December 2003, and later with other
regional health bureaus in Oromia, Amhara and Benishangul-Gumuz regional states.
242
S.A. Mengiste, M. Aanestad / Information and Organization 23 (2013) 233–257
5.1.1. Phase 1: Negotiating interests within and between social worlds
The ﬁrst visit made to the AAHB was in February 2003 where the HISP team members presented the
DHIS software to the ofﬁcials of the Planning and Programming Department of the bureau. The ofﬁcials
pointed out that the health bureau had serious problems with the existing paper-based routine health
management information systems (HMIS) and indicated their willingness to collaborate with HISP to
computerize HMIS. But they made it clear that the ﬁnal decision on the collaboration would be made by
the head of the health bureau.
Another meeting was organized with the head of the health bureau as well as heads of vertical
programs and the head of the Planning and Programming Department. Three HISP-Ethiopia team
members (including the ﬁrst author of this paper) participated in the meeting. During that meeting
several issues, problems, and questions were negotiated among the participants. The meeting made it
clear that the existing paper-based system reﬂected both poor data management (i.e. inadequate data,
incomplete record and untimely reporting) and poor use of information for action. The HISP team
members proposed a solution to introduce standardized data collection and reporting tools and to
automate the existing paper-based system using DHIS. Following this proposal, the participants raised
different concerns about the potential of DHIS technology, as well as user training and sustainability
issues. For example, one health program manager questioned the HISP team:
“How are you going to make the system practically functional when most of the future users at different
levels of the health bureau are without any background on using computers for information processing
and report generation?” (Health program manager, January 2004).
In response the HISP team members made it clear that the process of implementing the new system
would involve capacity development of end users through training on basic computer skills and on
functionalities of DHIS software. Discussion also touched upon issues related to sustainability and
technical support, as well as the possibility for integration of the DHIS with an on-going project to
implement a patient record system. The head of the health bureau concluded:
“… we are happy that you come with such a timely solution to solve our practical problem of improving
the management of health data. HMIS is our priority and we need to improve it …. We are willing to
mobilize whatever resources we have including the required manpower, material and ﬁnancial
resources” (Head of AAHB, January 2004).
In this meeting, the head of the health bureau and other program heads indicated their willingness to
collaborate with HISP toward introducing DHIS at different levels of the AAHB. Then a prototype of DHIS
version 1.3 was demonstrated to the management team members and other staff at the health bureau. The
database had been populated with data from two of the 10 sub-cities over a nine-month period, thus
reports could be generated based on real data from the city's health facilities. Some standard reports were
produced and also the possibility to use pivot tables to generate ad hoc reports was demonstrated. This
was greatly appreciated by the management, which as a result endorsed DHIS 1.3 to be customized and
implemented at all levels of the city administration, i.e. both in the AAHB, at the sub-city and at the health
facility levels.
The prototype approach had been deliberately chosen, as the then HISP-Ethiopia project coordinator
pointed out:
“… since users were not good in precisely telling their requirements, the prototype approach was chosen
to identify requirements. The prototype was prepared in consultation with the domain experts using
nine months routine data collected from two sub-cities. … This enabled management and users to have a
clear understanding and vision on what is intended to accomplish …. For the reporting format, we used
pivot table to identify user requirements” (HISP-Ethiopia coordinator, June 2004).
Developing this prototype had required HISP team members to conduct several consultations and
discussions with the domain experts to understand the data sets, report layouts, and interfaces
required by the end users, i.e. a learning opportunity. The presentation of the prototype in the
243
S.A. Mengiste, M. Aanestad / Information and Organization 23 (2013) 233–257
workshop itself created an opportunity for further discussion and mutual learning on the weakness
and strengths of the software. As one of the HMIS coordinators at the regional health bureau
indicated:
“… the prototype demonstration created a better environment for us not only to comprehend the system
and express their needs and requirements but also to appreciate and develop interest in the DHIS
software. Besides, this process also helped to easily identify inconsistencies and problems in the current
reporting formats, such as existence of similar data elements in multiple reporting formats with different
purposes. We were really happy to see the sample reports generated using our own data, and
understand that we can generate ad-hoc reports easily using pivot table reports” (HMIS coordinator,
AAHB, July 2004).
In the process of developing and discussing the prototype, both the HISP team members and the
involved health domain experts went through an interactive learning process. The discussion during the
presentation of the prototype helped the technical HISP-team members to identify errors in some modules
and to correct those errors. For example, based on the comments received from the health domain experts,
the ICD module was redesigned to incorporate ICD description column mimicking the paper format of
morbidity and mortality data entry and reporting forms.
DHIS software was customized with the full participation of the domain experts at different levels.
The customization process involved adapting the software that had been developed in South Africa (see
Braa & Hedberg, 2002) to ﬁt to the Ethiopian health system's administrative structure. Some of the
major appropriations made on the system included: changing the system to ﬁt to the Ethiopian ﬁscal
year period (Ethiopia does not follow the Gregorian calendar of the Western world, but has its own
calendar, quite similar to the Julian calendar); incorporating a new module for registration and
reporting of data according to the ICD (International Classiﬁcation of Diseases) codes; this was locally
called the “morbidity and mortality” module; deﬁning and coding the actual data elements, indicators
and standard reports into the system. The latter task, however, involved a non-trivial process of
standardization and harmonization of data elements across various vertical health programs, to which
we now turn.
5.1.2. Phase 2: Negotiating the standardization process
The process of standardization primarily aimed at developing regional standardized essential datasets,
health indicators, uniform primary and secondary data collection instruments, and customizing and
standardizing DHIS software to address local requirements.
The primary task in this standardization process was to mobilize key stakeholders and align their
interests. As a result, a team involving representatives from multiple domains was established,
comprising health bureau managers, participants working within disease-speciﬁc (so-called “vertical”)
programs, and practitioners. From the health bureau the participants included the head of Health
Services, Family Health, Disease Prevention and Control, and the team leaders of the IDSR (Integrated
Disease Surveillance Response) team, the Tuberculosis/Leprosy team and the HIV/AIDS teams. Also the
information, education and communication (IEC) expert, the network administrator at the health
bureau, the bureau head and representatives from sub-cities were included. The team focused on the
information needs of the AAHB, where there were three major tasks: analysis of the organizational
structure and management levels of the health care system, analysis of the functions and various
activities performed by the management at different levels, and determining the information and
indicators they need for decision making.
However, the standardization process was a complex and difﬁcult process of change, since the different
stakeholders had different interests and commitments. Each group came to the table with its own sets of
interests, practices, and values and would like to inscribe it in the new standard. For example, each of the
vertical health programs in the public sector had their own structure, work practices, and data collection
tools and standards. It was characterized by diverse data collection and reporting forms, as well as
variation in the frequency and content of reports (see also Braa, Hanseth, et al., 2007). This diversity of
interests, reﬂected in the fragmented structure of the current, paper-based HMIS, made it extremely
difﬁcult to change existing data elements, reporting tools and reporting procedures. Tensions and conﬂicts
244
S.A. Mengiste, M. Aanestad / Information and Organization 23 (2013) 233–257
arose when these standards and routines were challenged by another group of actors who had different
interests, commitments, or values. It was difﬁcult to convince different vertical health program managers
to reduce the number of data elements based on the principle of “information for action.”6 As one of the
HISP-Ethiopia team members indicated:
“… while preparing and demonstrating the prototype using standardised data sets, program managers
were ﬁghting to ensure their own respective need on what to be included in the report rather than
focusing on the integration and development of standardised regional datasets. We were always forced
to negotiate on the importance of having integrated essential data sets” (HISP-Ethiopia team member,
July 2004).
However, the participants easily agreed on eliminating other data elements that were judged to be
non-essential. For example, the new data collection format eliminated the previous age categories (0 to
11 months and 12 to 23 months) on EPI7 data as it was not seen as valuable for decision making, merely
contributing to an increased registration workload of health workers.
During the standardization process, the ﬁrst author along with two other PhD students from the HISP
Ethiopia team conducted meetings and discussions with health workers and managers at different levels,
make regular visits to health institutions to get insights on the data requirements from front line health
workers and statisticians, and conduct informal face-to-face discussions and telephone conversations with
health workers and vertical program managers at different levels. Following multiple meetings,
discussions and negotiations, the HISP team was able to develop a draft version of the data sets and
reporting formats for the activities of the following programs: Maternal and Child Health (MCH), Disease
Prevention & Health, Health Education, and Health services. Then, a workshop was organized to discuss
these draft standards. Health experts and statisticians from all health facilities, from the sub-city health
departments, and representatives of vertical programs from the health bureau took part in workshop. In
addition, representatives from different vertical health programs and services of the Federal Ministry of
Health, and representatives of donor organizations participated.
These deliberations were not trivial since many crossing interests were prevalent. In addition, the
Addis Ababa Health Bureau could not decide these changes on their own, as many changes required the
approval and consent of both the national ministry of health and the individual speciﬁc vertical programs.
For example, as Lagebo and Molla (2005) reported, although there were reports that “the data collected by
the ISDR8 and IMCI9 reporting formats were also collected by MM10 reporting format; it was not possible
to modify these reporting formats without consulting the respective vertical program managers at the
national level” (Lagebo & Molla, 2005, pp. 126). Due to such conﬂicts and differences in interest among
different actors, the process resulted in a cumbersome regional “data set” containing a long list of data
elements some of which were not essential for action and managerial decision making; which in effect
violates the fundamental principles of simplicity and parsimony, and “information for action” in designing
and developing HIS (Braa & Blobel, 2003).
This was the result of the powerful actors (particularly the vertical programs at national level)
insisting on maintaining most of their respective data elements regardless of their relevance for action
and decision making. This had a negative effect in maintaining the status quo by downgrading the
interest of less powerful actors (such as health workers and statisticians at health facilities and
sub-city health ofﬁces) who strived for more essential data sets and for less redundant and well
integrated data collection and reporting forms. To deal with this challenge of balancing the local and
national requirements, the top management of the AAHB followed a strategy to negotiate with vertical
programs operating at the regional level and reached an agreement to eliminate some of the data
6 Information for action: it is a principle to show that public health programs must ensure more than the mere transmission or
dissemination of surveillance results to others; rather, surveillance data should be presented in a manner that facilitates their use for
public health action (Goodman et al., 2000).

elements from each respective vertical program that were redundant and were not used for action
and decision making.
Then, another round of workshop was held to revise the new data elements and reporting formats. In this
ﬁnal workshop, the new HMIS standard for Addis Ababa health bureau was endorsed with the regional
essential data sets, lists of indicators as well as reporting tools for the regional health bureau. Then the new
standards of data collection and reporting formats were customized and incorporated into DHIS system so
that health workers and managers at health facility, sub-city, and health bureau levels would use the same
standardized platform to collect, analyze and report routine health data. In November 2007, there were two
and half years' report generated electronically; the software was being used for data management activities at
all levels of the AAHB and had been integrated into day to day routines of health workers, statisticians and
managers at different levels. An assessment of the software's impact showed that there was signiﬁcant
improvement with regard to the reporting performance and in making the required data available for analysis
and decision making at different levels of the health bureau.
The success gained from Addis Ababa and the learning outcome from the standardization and
software customization process had also been used as a driving force to expand HISP initiative and to
undertake the process of standardization and software customization in other regional states
including Oromia, Amhara and Benishangul-Gumuz (see Lagebo & Molla, 2005; Mengiste, 2010).
The resulting standardized data set, the customized system of version 1.3 as well as the training
materials developed for Addis was taken as points of departure when introducing DHIS in the new
regions.
5.2. Trajectories of customizing DHIS 2.0 in Ethiopia
The version of the DHIS which was deployed in Addis Ababa as well as the other pilot regions was version
1.3. While DHIS 1.3 was a Free and Open Source application, it was built to work on Microsoft Access platform
which requires installation of Microsoft Windows and the Ofﬁce suite. The limitation of DHIS 1.3 had been
recognized by all global stakeholders of the HISP network and in May 2004, the Department of Informatics
at University of Oslo hired a full time researcher to work on the design and development of a
platform-independent version, DHIS version 2.0. Another PhD student also joined in June 2004 and together
they started assessment and selection of technological platforms and tools to meet the new demands. The aim
was to create a globally distributed team of both Northern and Southern developers that employed
technologies and frameworks from the Open Source community. The resulting system was aimed to be
modular, platform independent and offer web enabled functionality (Staring & Titlestad, 2006). The
development of this version was pushed by a strong wish for a truly open source version of DHIS. At the same
time, there was also a strong demand from the health authorities in the Indian state of Kerala, one of the HISP
sites where the political and ideological commitment to OSS was particularly strong. As a result, the
development team in Oslo in collaboration with the Indian developers developed Milestone 1 of DHIS version
2.0 and it was released on February 15th 2006, and immediately deployed in Kerala.
Several versions of DHIS version 2.0 have been released since then by core developers in Oslo in
collaboration with developers from India, Vietnam and Ethiopia, and the system has been customized and
implemented in several countries including India and Vietnam. This section, therefore, provides an
account of the trajectories, negotiations and challenges encountered in customizing and implementing
DHIS 2.0 in the Ethiopian context.
5.2.1. Negotiations within the HISP social world and sub-worlds
The idea of customizing and implementing DHIS 2.0 in Ethiopia was initially brought to the table in
March 2006 when two professors from the University of Oslo who are members of the HISP global
research and development team visited Ethiopia to assess and provide support on the implementation of
DHIS 1.3 in different regional states including AAHB. In one of the meetings with the HISP-Ethiopia
development and implementation team members, the professors briefed the HISP Ethiopia team on the
potentials of the new version (DHIS 2.0) and proposed this software to be customized and piloted in two
regional states (namely Tigray and Benishangul-Gumuz). However, the idea was not endorsed by all
members of the HISP-Ethiopia team and all parties agreed to have an open discussion through the
HISP-Ethiopia mailing list in order to entertain different views and get feedback from different actors that
246
S.A. Mengiste, M. Aanestad / Information and Organization 23 (2013) 233–257
were not present in that meeting. Several ideas were raised through the mailing list and an excerpt of
some of the views is presented as follows:
• HISP-Ethiopia implementation team 1: “limit the implementation of DHIS 2.0 to Tigray and implement
DHIS 1.4 in Benishangul. DHIS 2.0 is being updated frequently and the current strategy proposed for
Ethiopia requires more resources (speciﬁcally support) to incorporate the changes if we want to scale
the system to many sites.”
• PhD student 1: “Limit the piloting of DHIS 2.0 only in Tigray regional state at the level of the regional
health bureau until the software matures and the local development and customization team gains
experience on the technologies and tools used to develop the software.”
• PhD student 2: “Because of infrastructural problem, it may be difﬁcult to implement DHIS 2.0 in
Benishangul. It is better to go for DHIS 1.4 in Benishangul. I don't think it is appropriate to pilot DHIS 2.0
in Tigray since their previous position is to wait and see the decision of the Federal Ministry of Health on
the new data sets and reporting formats before any action.”
• Professor from University of Oslo: “… my suggestion is to think about possible strategies to address the
challenges, rather than taking the view that it is not possible.”
The overall impression from the discussion during the meetings as well as from the views on the mailing
list suggests that the group who had experience with implementation of DHIS version 1.3 (the old-timers)
was skeptical and mustered arguments related to the infrastructure required for adopting the new system,
the lack of skill and capacity of the local team to customize the new version, and the immaturity of the new
version. But, as the new MSc students from the local HISP team and the global HISP team (the new-comers)
were in favor of initiating DHIS 2.0 as a pilot project, a decision was made to customize and implement the
new system in two pilot regional states ﬁrst and to roll out the system nationally once the system would
mature and a political agreement could be reached with the Federal Ministry of Health. Indeed, this decision
had also required the mandate and willingness of the Health Bureau ofﬁcials of the two regional states which
require political negotiation to convince the politicians on why the system is important and what practical
problems and challenges it addresses.
Then, a new HISP-Ethiopia development team was established in April 2006, consisting of 4 Ethiopian and 1
Vietnamese MSc students studying at the University of Oslo, 2 HISP-Ethiopia implementation team members,
and 1 full-time Java developer. The primary task was to customize the core modules of DHIS 2.0 to meet the
requirements of the Ethiopian context and to develop and incorporate new modules that are speciﬁcally
required by the Ethiopian public health care system (including morbidity and mortality modules).
The new team had diverse background and experiences. For example, the MSc students from university of
Oslo had a relatively better background on Java frameworks and other DHIS 2.0 core technologies, since they
took a course on Java and core open source software technologies while they were in Oslo in fall 2006. On the
other hand, the two old-timers had not had any formal training or exposure on Java frameworks and open
source software tools and technologies. They were rather more familiar with the architecture of the
MS-Access based DHIS 1.3 as they have been leading its implementation in Addis Ababa. Such difference in
background and exposure created tensions among the new team particularly in dealing with possible
development and implementation strategies and approaches. For example, when we asked about the
progress in the customization process, one of the team members stated the following:
“…. We still do not have consensus on how to go about the implementation of DHIS 2.0. My conviction is
that before we decide on the transition to DHIS 2.0, we need to build the capacity of the technical team in
order to customize the software. The HISP team members in Addis are not familiar with many of the
DHIS 2.0 core technologies and Java programming. This needs some time before we understand and start
customization” (HISP implementation team member, August 2006).
In contrast, when another member of the team was asked about his views on the customization of DHIS
2.0, he stated that:
“… personally, I am convinced that DHIS 2.0 must be implemented in Ethiopia in whatever way. I believe
it is the best solution for routine data management and will solve many of the problems related to
routine data management” (MSc student).
247
S.A. Mengiste, M. Aanestad / Information and Organization 23 (2013) 233–257
Several efforts were made to bridge this gap in technical competency among the new HISP-Ethiopia
team members. For example, at the initial stage of the project, the core developer hired by HISP offered an
in-house training on the basics of Java for both the Master's students and the two implementation team
members. The Vietnamese developer also stayed in Ethiopia for about three months and played a
signiﬁcant role in strengthening the local team's technical competence on DHIS 2.0 core technologies. His
support and presence with the local team for a relatively long time span had signiﬁcantly contributed to
initiate the customization of DHIS 2.0 by the Ethiopian team.
Besides, two developers from the University of Oslo also stayed in Ethiopia for about two weeks and
assisted the local team in incorporating the indicator module, ﬁnalizing the morbidity–mortality module
and import–export module for the Ethiopian version of DHIS 2.0. Besides, the local HISP team members
created a local forum to discuss and share ideas and views on different issues including implementation
strategies, technical competence needed by the team members and challenges in dealing with the politics
of the public health care system.
In addition to the on-site support, the local team also got support through the online electronic
collaboration platform (the mailing lists and a collaborative “wiki” web site). The team worked in
collaboration with globally distributed team of HISP developers (mainly from the University of Oslo and
from the HISP Vietnam team). However, the online support was of limited value due to poor internet
connectivity in Ethiopia, which also inhibited the up- and down-loading of code and development tools,
such as libraries. This was problematic since a lot of the open source frameworks and tools are
connectivity-dependent. As one of the respondents indicated:
“It was really difﬁcult and still is to download different milestones from the remote server in Oslo when
new versions are released. For example it took many days to download milestone 2 from the remote
server. When we have technical difﬁculties we always depend on the technical team in Oslo to upload
source code for us” (HISP-Ethiopia team member, June 2006).
In the summer of 2007, DHIS 2.0 was fully customized with all the necessary modules required for the
Ethiopian public health care system context despite all the challenges and problems encountered by the
local development team. The practical experiences obtained from the process of customizing DHIS 1.3 and
developing standards had positively contributed in the success of customizing the new DHIS 2.0.
Especially those who were deeply involved in the customization and implementation of DHIS 1.3 in Addis
Ababa, helped to share the domain speciﬁc knowledge they gained during their long term involvement
with practitioners. They collaborated extensively with core developers in deﬁning the data elements, in
customizing exiting modules, developing new modules (mainly the morbidity and mortality module), and
in identifying and designing the reporting types and formats that were incorporated into the system.
While the HISP-Ethiopia team members were in the process of piloting the system in the two regional
health bureaus (Tigray and Benishangul-Gumuz), the Federal Ministry of Health made an announcement
that calls all HIS computerization initiatives that are carried out at different regional health bureaus
without its mandate to be halted. However, despite this announcement from the Ministry of Health, the
regional heath bureaus that HISP had been working with chose to defy the announcement and continue to
use DHIS 1.3; however, HISP was not able to pilot DHIS 2.0 in Tigray and Benishangul-Gumuz due to the
new regulation.
The FMoH then established a National Advisory Committee (NAC) that would work on reviewing,
redesigning and implementing a cascaded national HMIS at all levels of health care delivery system. HISP
was also invited to be a member of NAC along with other stakeholders including: PPD/FMOH,11 Family
Health, TV and Leprosy Control, several vertical program managers, World Health Organization (WHO),
Tulane University, Centre for Disease Control (CDC), John Snow Incorporated (JSI), and representatives of
the different Regional Health Bureaus.
5.2.2. Negotiations between HISP and national actors
Since early 2004, HISP had been successful in mobilizing inﬂuential actors from regional health bureaus
(including Addis Ababa, Amhara, Benishangul-Gumuz, and Oromyia) (see Lagebo & Molla, 2005; Mengiste,
11 PPD/FMOH: Planning and Programming Department/Federal Ministry of Health.
248
S.A. Mengiste, M. Aanestad / Information and Organization 23 (2013) 233–257
2010); and got their mandate to computerize the existing routine paper-based HIS. As the case of DHIS 1.3
customization and implementation in Addis demonstrated, the secret behind the successful implemen-
tation of the system at all levels in Addis was the close partnership and collaboration between the different
stakeholders both from the IS and the public health social worlds and sub-worlds of the Addis Ababa city
government.
However, in the case of DHIS 2.0, in spite of the fact that the system was fully customized and was
ready for implementation in the summer of 2007, the system was not implemented in any public health
setting. Several obstacles and roadblocks hindered HISP Ethiopia to implement DHIS 2.0 in Ethiopia. The
most prominent reason was the lack of willingness at the national level to endorse the system and allow
its implementation as a national system.
Primarily, getting the support of the inﬂuential actors from the Federal Ministry of Health was an up-hill
battle for HISP-Ethiopia team members. We had several meetings with ofﬁcials at the Ministry of Health
(especially with ofﬁcials from the Planning and Programming Department), and we also made several
prototype presentations of the system to the team of the national advisory committee (NAC). None of our
efforts were fruitful as most of the stakeholders were trying to maximize their beneﬁts and fulﬁll their
interests from the entire change process. One justiﬁcation for this conﬂict of interest among the different
stakeholders is the perception they had toward integration of the national health information system.
The Ministry of Heath had made it clear in its bid that it wanted to develop an integrated HIS, and
invited all the potential stakeholders, including funding agencies and vertical programs. So, though many
of the stakeholders superﬁcially supported the notion of integration, some had voiced concerns about
abandoning their well-established work processes and be part of an integrated system that demanded
some compromises in terms of the data elements or reporting formats they have been using. For them,
endorsing systems such as DHIS 2.0 that would support an integrated data collection and reporting system
of different health programs and makes health information more visible and accessible to a larger group of
users and mangers would be in conﬂict with their interests. Besides, there were some stakeholders who
were convinced that integration will increase complexity as information from health programs needs to be
comprehensive and correlated, for example by integrating maternal and child health follow-up with HIV/
AIDS and TB treatment processes within one integrated health information architecture.
So, most of the stakeholders from vertical programs showed superﬁcial support for an integrated
system, but in practice they rejected initiatives and systems that aimed for integrated health information
system. Primarily, the issue of integration is deeply embedded in the politics of health care delivery, donor
money, national and local government agendas, the battle of vendors, and civil society's processes. When
it comes to the case of introducing DHIS 2.0 as a national system, most of the actors from different vertical
programs who were also members of NAC may have considered HISP and DHIS 2.0 as a threat to their
interests. They also knew that there was no other system from other competitors that was ready to be
deployed and used right away. These forces could easily mobilize political and institutional legitimacy and
support from ofﬁcials of the Federal Ministry of Health to prevent DHIS 2.0 from being endorsed and
implemented at a national level.
As expected, in 2008, the Federal Ministry of Health through NAC announced that another international
company was the winner of the national tender process, and the planned DHIS 2.0 implementation by
HISP-Ethiopia team in various regions came to a standstill. The irony is that, even after ﬁve years of the
ofﬁcial announcement made by the FMoH, and after millions of dollars were spent (including workshops,
meetings, per diems, training, travel, consultancy etc); the company that won the tender was not able to
deliver the system and the HIS in Ethiopia is still paper-based. Where DHIS 1.3 had been implemented
(such as in Addis Ababa), however, its usage continued in the period awaiting the development and
implementation of the new national system endorsed by the ministry of health.
6. Analysis and discussion
We argued initially that there is a split between studies that displays an awareness of the political
nature of IS implementation, and studies which link learning and participation. While the ﬁrst category of
studies emphasizes that different stakeholder groups need to work together to discuss, negotiate, and
interact, they to a smaller degree theorize learning. The latter category of studies focuses on user
participation in systems development and is more attentive to how learning occurs, but may tend to
249
S.A. Mengiste, M. Aanestad / Information and Organization 23 (2013) 233–257
disregard the larger organizational context in which the learning activities happen. Thus, in practice, an
explicit linking of participation, politics and learning is relatively rare in the current IS literature, which
consequently does not sufﬁciently illuminate the impact of organizational politics, conﬂicts, and tensions
between different stakeholders on the learning process.
In this article, we have described how learning happened in a long-term collaborative partnership
between different stakeholders, drawing on the concepts of social worlds, boundary objects, and
negotiated order (Clarke, 1991; Clarke & Star, 2008; Strauss, 1978). We conceptualize the activities
organized around the IS as on-going attempts at negotiating order between multiple stakeholders. In this
process of creating, maintaining and transforming the order, learning happened in and through
negotiations which were related to concrete action on different aspects of the HIS and often emerged
out of conﬂict or differences in interest and values. Our research questions focused on what characterized
the learning processes, what challenges were encountered, and how those challenges were mediated and
negotiated.
In the process of customizing, implementing and scaling DHIS 1.3 in Addis Ababa, different
stakeholders, belonging to multiple social worlds, came together for practical collaboration and concrete
actions of design and implementation, including the standardization processes, workshops, one-to-one
meetings, prototype demos, and user training sessions. These activities, which were all in different ways
centered on the IS, facilitated ongoing learning among all participants.
The HISP-Ethiopia team members learned about the structure of public health care system, how public
health care is delivered, and how data is collected and how it is reported. The same activities created
opportunities for the domain experts to make sense of the technology and learn about the technology's
features, functionalities and potential for improving their work practices. Health workers learnt about new
ways of data entry, analysis and report generation using the DHIS 1.3 software, how to use tools such as
Excel to generate reports with graphs and charts, and they shared experiences and hints among
themselves during training sessions and workshops.
However, this was not a smooth and linear learning process; rather there were tensions and conﬂicts of
interest among different stakeholder groups. For instance, in the initial process of customization of DHIS
1.3, the process of seeking to reduce the number of data elements touched on issues where the different
vertical programs tended to ﬁght for their own requirements whereas the top management and HISP team
advocated for revision and for minimum and essential data sets. The debates around this were aided by the
possibility to visualize the problem through a prototype demonstration, as well as the concrete activities
and discussions in work groups that developed draft standards and later a ﬁnal regional dataset.
The DHIS software, with its associated requirements for standardized datasets, was therefore central
for initiating these discussions, for bringing out the differences, and for mediating the negotiations that
followed. If we here categorize the system as a boundary object, it is crucial to recognize that it did not just
help cross boundaries through facilitating communication and collaboration, but that it did so through a
process where it “forced” the existing differences and conﬂicts to be brought into the light and made
available for negotiations. Moreover, we believe the successful result of the process around DHIS 1.3 was
crucially related to the perceived and expected usefulness of it as a tool for the healthcare work. As Jensen
and Markussen (2007) noted, “technology is central to work, cognition and learning: […] the
technological environment in which we work cannot be separated from what and how we learn”
(Jensen & Markussen, 2007, pp. 204). The concerns of all the social worlds involved were sufﬁciently
overlapping around the role of DHIS 1.3 as a tool, and this shared perception of the meaning of the system
legitimated their participation.
The DHIS was also presented and perceived as a useful tool during similar negotiations with other
regional states; however, a different picture emerges around DHIS 2.0. Also here the software itself was a
boundary object that stimulated learning, however, this was not in a similar setting, but involved other
actors and social worlds. An arena for negotiations between the social worlds of information systems and
public health was not established around the DHIS 2.0, but two other arenas are evident. The ﬁrst arena
where the DHIS 2.0 functioned as a boundary object was between two subworlds of HISP Ethiopia — the
‘old-timers’ and the ‘newcomers’. Their shared commitment allowed them to cooperate around the
software and achieve learning, e.g. on Java, MySQL, and open source development platforms. However, the
primary role of the boundary object (the DHIS software) was not anymore the “tool” it had been in the
previous constellation of actors. Now its role as a boundary object was that of “novel software”; as a core
250
S.A. Mengiste, M. Aanestad / Information and Organization 23 (2013) 233–257
object of their work as systems developers. The new constellation of actors saw a stronger inﬂuence from
the international HISP community in this phase. Initially dispute and discussions emerged around the
feasibility of the software and what would be a sensible implementation strategy. The boundary between
the two sub-worlds of HISP Ethiopia, which followed the mastery of different technologies, was bridged
through negotiations as well as practical action and collaboration where the ‘old-timers’ learnt novel
technical skills and the ‘newcomers’ learnt about the health domain and its institutional and political
context.
The second arena where the DHIS 2.0 was a boundary object was on the national level, in the processes
initiated by the Federal Ministry of Health around the national advisory committee (NAC). The
constellation of actors around the NAC comprised a very different set of social worlds and subworlds
than the initial collaboration with the AAHB. Still, the DHIS 2.0 served as a boundary object that generated
communication, interaction and negotiation between members of different social worlds. For example, on
several NAC meetings the prototype of DHIS 2.0 was used to initiate discussions and negotiations on the
requirements set by the technical consultant at the FMoH, on the functionalities of DHIS 2.0, on what it can
deliver (in terms of user interface and data analysis and report generation), and on its limitations
compared to the requirements. The HISP developers customized the system and incorporated comments
forwarded by the planning and programming department, the technical consultant and other NAC
members during several rounds. However, despite the ﬂexibility and robustness of the software to
accommodate the different interests expressed, it was difﬁcult to build a shared understanding and an
effective alignment of interest around the boundary object because of the politically charged nature of the
work in the NAC. While the regional health bureaus supported the DHIS, there was signiﬁcant resistance
from the international donor groups and the planning and programming department of the FMoH against
the selection of DHIS 2.0 as a national system. Thus, even though there were several opportunities for
learning for the different actors involved, the outcome was different from the processes at the regional
level. In this context the DHIS' role as a boundary object was that of “a candidate system” for the national
solution, and a working mode of evaluation and competition among different candidate organizations and
the system eventually did not lead to the same types of joint action and problem solving.

The following ﬁgure (Fig. 1) provides a summary of the different social worlds and sub-worlds involved
as well as the boundary objects used to mediate negotiations and interaction between social worlds and
sub-worlds.
6.1. Discussion
The social worlds perspective allows us to examine learning processes that occur in shifting and open
constellations of actors. Thus it opens up the broader situation as well as the temporal dynamics for
analysis (Clarke, 2005; Clarke & Star, 2008; Strauss, 1991). It has helped us to give attention to the social
structures that conditions learning in such processes, and to be aware of how these structures are
renegotiated through the participation and negotiation of different stakeholders which impact both the
constellations of actors itself and the concrete activities that are undertaken. We believe that this is
particularly relevant to our case, as we have studied processes that are different from traditional systems
development projects, where one organization assigns a development task to systems development
professionals. In our case we discuss not an organizational standalone system, but a component of an
inter-organizational, sector-wide information infrastructure. This implies that multiple actors with
different interests are involved; thus politics are unavoidable and should be taken into account (Sahay,
Monteiro, & Aanestad, 2009). Especially in a developing country context the presence of international
donors which are strong actors in the public sector, inevitably introduces inﬂuences from international
politics. Moreover, this was not a classic commercial or proprietary system built for a customer, but
globally shared open source software. This has implications for the need to build local capacity and
accommodate the existing infrastructure, challenges which again are speciﬁc to the context, as well as
creating adequate relations to the global development team.
For these reasons we consider it important to examine learning and participation with sensitivity to the
social structures that were present. We saw that learning was integral to the joint action, interactions and
negotiations between different actors. This learning was not a harmonious process, and we have provided
an account that emphasizes tensions, conﬂicts and controversies as driving forces in the learning process.
To conceptualize this as negotiated order between social worlds (Clarke, 1991; Modell, 2006; Strauss,
1978) has helped us capture how diverse actors interacted, communicated, negotiated, and acted — and
how they learnt (or not learnt) through this. The notion of social worlds has therefore offered us an
alternative theoretical lens that has allowed us to recognize the role of organizational tensions and
conﬂicts derived from different commitments to actions, activities and values.
Our analysis also drew on the notion of boundary objects; a notion that has enjoyed a substantial
take-up outside STS (Zeiss & Groenewegen, 2009). In the original formulation of the notion, the
interpretive ﬂexibility was a core characteristic of a boundary object. This would facilitate ‘cooperation
without consensus’, i.e. communication and/or coordination could be achieved between different social
worlds, however, the worlds would remain different and autonomous. It was exactly this balance of
autonomy with collective action that was to be explained by the notion of boundary objects. It is also
worthwhile to note that these boundary objects were seen to be the outcomes (rather than causes) of
processes where convergence between the information needs of the social worlds and the artifacts had
been achieved and maintained (Star, Bowker, & Neuman, 1997).
Later conceptualizations of boundary objects, especially in organizational studies, tend to rather focus
on boundary objects as ‘causes’, i.e. as instruments for achieving collaboration. These studies asks how
boundary objects facilitate knowledge transfer and learning through mediation, and how their potential
can be utilized to improve organizing, i.e. they have a more managerial and practical orientation (see e.g.
Carlile, 2002; Wenger, 1998). In our case, we think learning was facilitated by the boundary object, but not
merely through mediating or aligning the different actors. The meeting arenas that emerged around the
DHIS software did not just facilitate a ‘transfer’ of knowledge between communities. A more central role
was that these meetings between social worlds generated situations where different meanings were
exposed. When a concrete boundary object (the DHIS system) was presented, examined and worked on in
multiple ways, the differences of values, opinions, frames, expectations and preferences became visible.
This uncovering of differences was the pre-condition for learning. A major role of the boundary object was
thus to uncover tensions and to stimulate negotiations. This goes beyond mere mediation (Jonsson,
Holmström, & Lyytinen, 2009).
252
S.A. Mengiste, M. Aanestad / Information and Organization 23 (2013) 233–257
A similar recognition is captured by Charlotte Lee in the notion of a “boundary negotiating artifact”. She
emphasizes that boundary objects can “be used to push boundaries rather than merely sailing across
them” (Lee, 2007, pp. 307), since not just the objects, but also the boundaries themselves are being deﬁned
and negotiated. It has also been argued that social identities are shaped by the dynamics around boundary
objects (Gal et al., 2004). Pawlowski et al. (2000) also used the notion of boundary object brokering to
signify the “activities and processes directed toward achieving a convergence of boundary objects with the
set of communities of practice that they connect” (Pawlowski et al., 2000, pp. 332).
Our case helps to emphasize that such processes does not happen in isolation and is not dependent
only on the qualities of the boundary objects itself. We saw the changing role of the DHIS system when it
was the boundary object between different actor constellations, it served as a “tool”, as “novel software”
and as “a candidate system”. This has some resemblance to what Briers and Chua (2001) call “ideal” and
“visionary” objects, which are powerful in mobilizing joint action. The perceived role of the system
allowed the different actors legitimize their investments and participation in the process, however, this
assigned role also then shaped the type of actions and interactions that would follow, and thus it shaped
the space for learning. While Boujot and Blanco (2003) discusses the temporally changing role of
boundary objects as “intermediary objects” in a design process where the end product gradually takes
shape, our account emphasizes the explicit linkage of this process to the larger constellation of social
worlds and thus introduces an attention to the political context that shapes the space for and process of
learning.
7. Conclusion and implications
Our description of the introduction of a computerized HIS through participation and negotiation of
heterogeneous stakeholders from multiple social worlds shows that there are a number of key issues that
need to be taken into account when innovative technologies such as DHIS are customized, implemented
and used in complex public sector organizations in developing countries. Primarily, we recognize that the
adoption and implementation of information systems in health care settings has been investigated and
presented to the literature by several scholars (including Braa, Hanseth, et al., 2007; Braa & Hedberg, 2002;
Braa et al., 2004; Mengiste, 2010; Mosse & Sahay, 2005; Puri, Sahay, & Georgiadou, 2007; Sahay et al.,
2009). We also realize that the topics of learning and user participation are well-researched in IS research
(see for example Bjerknes & Brattetieg, 1995; He, 2004; Lyytinen, 1987; Newman & Noble, 1990; Robey et
al., 2000; Zhong & Majchrzak, 2004); however, most of these studies explored the topic from the context
of traditional systems development projects, where one organization assigns a development task to
systems development professionals. Besides, the notion of power relations in both cognitive and
practice-based perspectives of learning has not received sufﬁcient attention.
Our case study in this paper has differed from existing literature in several ways. We explored the case
of a system that has been developed elsewhere and which is freely available for anyone who wishes to
deploy it. The system is ﬂexible and can be customized to accommodate different requirements, but this
requires the build-up of a strong local community which links up with the globally shared development
and support network. The context where the system has been customized and implemented was also
different: a complex network of organizational and human actors ﬁghting for scarce resources which
triggers tensions and often demands different approaches on how to organize user participation and
learning. In this paper, therefore, we used the notion of learning to be an integral part of the social practice
that, ﬁrst and foremost, involved participation and occurs mainly through actions, interactions and
negotiations between different actors who might have competing interests and values.
We have provided an empirical account that emphasizes tensions, conﬂicts and controversies as
driving forces in the learning process. Our understanding of the learning process draws on Strauss (and
others) conceptualizations of “negotiated order” between ‘social worlds’ (Clarke, 1991; Modell, 2006;
Strauss, 1978). Since this helped us capture how diverse actors interacted, communicated, negotiated, and
took actions on a number of issues in the process of designing, customizing and implementing
computerized HIS; we argue that this perspective is especially relevant if we want to broaden our
understanding of learning to encompass also differences among stakeholders, and what this entails in
terms of tensions, conﬂicts and negotiations.

Unlike many cognitive or practice-oriented accounts of learning, which treat learning as a harmonious
process (Contu & Willmot, 2003; Huysman & Elkjaer, 2006), the social worlds perspective sheds light on
tensions and conﬂicts that emerge when stakeholders from different social worlds struggle to defend their
interests and values. The notion of social worlds has therefore offered us an alternative theoretical lens
that has allowed us to recognize the role of organizational tensions and conﬂicts derived from different
commitments to actions, activities and values. This perspective thus complements other perspectives on
situated learning dynamics such as: situated learning (Lave, 1988); the sociology of work and technology
(Bowker et al., 1995); distributed cognition (Hutchins, 1995); and social studies of information systems
(Ciborra et al., 2000). Our analysis of learning as being facilitated by boundary objects also contributes to
the literature of boundary objects by underscoring that boundary objects did not just help through
mediating communication and collaboration across boundaries, but that it did so through a process where
it “forced” the existing differences and conﬂicts to be brought into the light and made available for
negotiations and learning.
Our analysis of learning, participation and power relations also provides important practical insights
for IS development and implementation in developing countries in general and within public health care
system in particular. One important issue that our analysis revealed is the necessity to involve end-users in
the customization and implementation of systems that are developed elsewhere and implemented in a
new context. Indeed end-user involvement has been addressed as an important determinant of the
eventual success of any information system (see for example, Franz & Robey, 1984; Mumford & Weir,
1979). User participation is more of a bottom-up approach that promotes the empowerment and
involvement of intended users in the design, development, and implementation of IT-based systems in
organizations. However, our ﬁndings revealed that issues of user empowerment and participation have
got little attention as data standards and technological solutions were chosen centrally by national actors
and move down to regions, districts and health facilities to be adopted, implemented and used. The
current practice, especially at the national level seems to lack end-user participation to ensure that the
system will improve work performance and increase efﬁciency. On the other hand, our experience in
Addis Ababa Health Bureau shows, that bottom-up and participatory approaches to systems development
create opportunities for end user participation and learning which in turn helps to deal with power
relations among the different actors and eventually avoid user resistance once the system is deployed.

Rationale: Gender-affirming healthcare can carry significant benefits for trans people. However, there are sub-
stantial geographical inequalities in the provision of and access to trans-specific healthcare across Europe.
Comparative healthcare systems research has typically focused on universal services, neglecting provision which
serves specific groups within populations (e.g., trans people).
Objective: This study aimed to develop a comparative typology of trans-specific healthcare systems across 28
European countries (the EU 27 plus the UK), and to examine country-level correlates which may influence or be
influenced by these systems.
Methods: Using hierarchical and k-means cluster analysis, countries were classified into four types based on
measures of trans-specific healthcare provision, regulation and access. Possible country-level correlates
(including socio-political climate, medical outcomes, and the general healthcare system) were investigated.
Results and discussion: The cluster analysis identified four clusters of trans-specific healthcare systems in Europe,
characterized as: 1) Centralized conservative (highly centralized, extensive range of treatments, few trans-specific
government policies); 2) Centralized reformist (highly centralized, extensive range of treatments, multiple trans-
specific government policies); 3) Decentralized marketized (highly decentralized, moderate range of treatments,
few trans-specific government policies); 4) Underdeveloped (highly decentralized, limited range of treatments,
few or no trans-specific government policies). We found statistically significant differences between the clusters
in rates of: public support for trans people; gender identity concealment; treatment access; overall health
expenditure; gender inequality.
Conclusions: The study develops a novel typology of trans-specific healthcare systems in Europe. It also identifies
a range of potential drivers and outcomes of geographical divergences and inequalities in trans-specific
healthcare provision. Building on this typology, future comparative research should aim to link the structure
of healthcare systems to outcomes for trans people. Comparative healthcare systems research must account for
the distinctive forms taken by services and systems that provide healthcare to specific groups within populations.
1. Introduction
Gender-affirming healthcare has substantial benefits for trans health
(following Pearce, 2018, p. 2, we use trans as an umbrella term for
‘identities, experiences and modes of gender presentation’ linked to a
‘social and/or physical transition’ reflecting a move away from the
gender assigned at birth). Gender-affirming treatments, including hor-
mone therapies and surgeries, are associated with increased quality of
life and decreased distress among trans adults (Doyle et al., 2023; Murad
et al., 2010); puberty suppressing treatment is associated with similar
benefits for trans youth (Mahfouda et al., 2017). However, for many
trans people across Europe, high-quality gender-affirming care remains
inaccessible. There are wide geographical discrepancies in the avail-
ability and quality of trans-specific healthcare between European
countries (TGEU, 2023). These gaps in provision significantly influence
the health of trans people in different places (Koch et al., 2020). This
geographical unevenness demands comparative investigation of the
distinct forms taken by trans-specific healthcare systems, and the factors
which shape these systems (Feldman et al., 2016). In this research, we
develop a typology of trans healthcare systems across 28 European

countries – the European Union (EU) 27 plus the United Kingdom (UK).
This marks a novel contribution to trans-specific healthcare research, in
which the settings and systems through which clinical interventions are
delivered have received only limited attention (Feldman et al., 2016;
Koehler et al., 2021).
Our study also makes a significant contribution to comparative
healthcare and welfare regime research. To date, this literature has
largely focused on classifying national systems in their entirety
(Esping-Andersen, 1990; Reibling et al., 2019; Wendt, 2009). In this
endeavor, researchers have utilized measures which are assumed to
apply to all members of a given national population, including overall
levels of expenditure, modes of legal regulation, and population-level
health outcomes (Freeman and Frisina, 2010; Reibling et al., 2019).
These focus on universal healthcare services (those offered by general
practitioners and unspecified ‘specialists’) and common diseases,
including heart disease, diabetes, and stroke (Reibling et al., 2019;
Wendt, 2009). However, this framing neglects the distinctive patterns of
epidemiology and treatment-seeking that are found among specific
groups within populations, particularly those who are marginalized
(Scheim
et
al.,
2022).
Consequently,
while
capturing
crucial
between-population variations, existing studies are generally insensitive
to
variations
within
populations.

focusing
exclusively
on
trans-specific healthcare services, our study demonstrates that health
system classifications can vary widely depending on assumptions which
are made about the types of services in question, and social groups they
are likely to serve. In turn, this opens up the possibility of comparative
healthcare and welfare regime research that is attuned to inequality,
injustice, and structural disadvantage within populations.
1.1. Barriers to trans healthcare and structural stigma
A focus on trans-specific healthcare systems is necessary as such
systems are burdened by distinctive barriers to care (Scheim et al.,
2022). Historically, medicalization of gender nonconformity has led to
“gatekeeping” by medical professionals, who are criticized for holding
the power to approve or deny access to gender-affirming care (shuster,
2021). Furthermore, direct discrimination against trans people by
medical staff remains common in many countries (Burgwal and Mot-
mans, 2020). Even well-intentioned providers often lack relevant
training in trans healthcare, while the systems and policies of healthcare
institutions can fail to account for the specific needs of trans people
(Scheim et al., 2022). For instance, registration and check-in systems
may be structured so that they cannot accommodate discrepancies be-
tween sex/gender markers on official documents and a person’s gender
identity (Cicero et al., 2019). A systematic review in the US found that
over a quarter of trans people had been refused access to healthcare at
least once (Kcomt, 2019). Even when access is granted, waiting times
can extend for many years (Pitts-Taylor, 2020). These barriers to care
are particularly significant because in many countries the social and
legal rights of trans people depend on their access to healthcare services,
with clinical diagnosis a condition of legal gender recognition in 15 EU
countries (and compulsory sterilization required in a further five)
(TGEU, 2023).
The barriers within trans healthcare systems reflect and compound
the marginalized social position of trans people more broadly (Winter
et al., 2016). This marginalization is a consequence of structural stigma
against trans people, broadly understood as ‘societal-level conditions,
cultural norms, and institutional policies that constrain the opportu-
nities, resources, and wellbeing of the stigmatized’ (Hatzenbuehler and
Link, 2014, p. 2). Through a range of social, economic and institutional
mechanisms, structural stigma exposes trans people to housing and
labor market insecurity (Ecker et al., 2019; Lepel, 2020) and reduces
access to both general and trans-specific healthcare provision (Falck and
Branstrom, 2023).
1.2. Trans-specific healthcare systems: the need for comparative
approaches
There are also significant geographical variations in trans margin-
alization. Across Europe there is increasing polarization, with countries
including Spain and Malta advancing legal protections for trans rights at
the same time as they are rolled back in Slovakia and Hungary
(ILGA-Europe, 2023; TGEU, 2023). However, to date little is known
about how these variations in context might affect the availability,
accessibility, and quality of trans-specific healthcare. This issue is
important because high quality care can contribute to the amelioration
of health inequities experienced by trans people (Scheim et al., 2022). At
present, most knowledge of trans-specific healthcare comes from
self-report studies (Cicero et al., 2019; Costa, 2023). This research has
identified key barriers to equitable treatment among clinicians and
healthcare providers (Alpert et al., 2023; Everhart et al., 2022; shuster,
2021), and demonstrated how trans people navigate and resist these
(Apodaca et al., 2022; Wagner et al., 2022). Comparative knowledge of
trans-specific healthcare systems comes from a small number of
cross-national surveys cataloguing the availability of particular treat-
ments and the level of centralization versus decentralization of trans
healthcare delivery in different countries (e.g., Koehler et al., 2021;
TGEU, 2023). However, these studies focus on different dimensions of
trans-specific healthcare systems in isolation rather than conceptual-
izing and classifying these systems in their entirety.
Consequently, this article develops a more comprehensive, taxo-
nomic approach to trans-specific healthcare systems. This approach
aims to support the development of theories and, ultimately, causal
hypotheses for inter-country differences and the specific trajectories of
various systems (Arts and Gelissen, 2002). Understanding these causal
relationships is crucial because trans healthcare systems are always
enmeshed in broader social, legal and political conflicts and contesta-
tions (Pearce, 2018). For instance, in recent years, countries including
Finland, France, Norway, Sweden, and the UK have introduced recom-
mendations or policies to restrict the use of so-called ‘puberty blockers’
by trans youth (Davis, 2023; Mahase, 2023). Critics argue that these
measures overlook professional consensus and existing research (Pang
et al., 2022). In the UK, they have been linked to media and public de-
bates which give credence to virulently anti-trans perspectives (Horton,
2023; Pang et al., 2022). Typologies of trans healthcare systems can
therefore lead to new comparative approaches, which can begin to
connect these shifting and fiercely contested social and political contexts
to variations in trans-specific healthcare, and ultimately the health and
wellbeing of trans people themselves.
1.3. Typologizing healthcare systems
Although comparative research on trans-specific healthcare systems
remains scarce, efforts to classify overall health and welfare systems into
distinct types have been undertaken for several decades (Arts and Gel-
issen, 2002; Freeman and Frisina, 2010). In Esping-Andersen’s (1990)
framework, geographical differences in welfare state provision are
classified largely by their capacity to decommodify citizens – that is, to
maintain their living standards independent of the labor market
(Bambra, 2005a). On this basis, he identifies three types of welfare
regime – liberal (e.g., US, Australia), conservative (e.g., Austria, France),
and social democratic (e.g., the Scandinavian countries) – finding that
social
democratic
regimes
possess
the
greatest
capacity
for
decommodification.
Esping-Andersen has been criticized for excluding healthcare in-
stitutions from the analysis of welfare states (Bambra, 2005a), leading
scholars to develop a range of more narrowly specified healthcare sys-
tem typologies (see Freeman and Frisina, 2010, pp. 167–171, for an
overview). Most often, these have classified national health services,
social insurance, and private insurance types based on an inductive
analysis of a limited number of example countries (Freeman and Frisina,
E. Kiely et al.
Social Science & Medicine 356 (2024) 117145
3
2010). A more recent innovation in this field is the use of deductive
approaches. For instance, Wendt et al. (2009) offer a deductive classi-
fication of 27 possible healthcare system types, depending on the social
and institutional organization of three dimensions: the financing of care
provision; the provision of health services; and the regulation of provision.
To these, Reibling (2010) adds a fourth dimension: access to healthcare.
Researchers have then proceeded to quantify these different dimensions
and develop deductive typologies using cluster analysis (B¨
ohm et al.,
2013). Cluster analysis is a data reduction technique which enables the
categorization of groups in which cases are relatively homogenous to
each other and relatively heterogenous to cases in other groups (Landau
and Ster, 2010; Norusis, 2010). Wendt (2009) pioneered this approach
within comparative healthcare systems research, using hierarchical
cluster analysis to classify the healthcare systems of 15 European
countries into three types: healthcare-provision oriented systems (exten-
sive range of services offering patient choice, funded by expensive social
insurance, e.g., Austria, Belgium, Luxembourg); universal coverage –
controlled access systems (limited range of services offered across pop-
ulation, funded by the state e.g., Denmark, Italy, UK); low budget –
restricted access systems (low spending and restricted access due to high
out-of-pocket payments, e.g., Finland, Portugal, Spain).
As we have suggested, typologies such as these tend to rely on
uninterrogated assumptions about the most broadly relevant typs of
services for various populations within these systems. In turn, they
require researchers to make judgements about which institutions
comprise the healthcare system versus other parts of the welfare state.
This question of boundedness is complex, as health outcomes are
determined not by a discrete set of institutions with sole responsibility
for healthcare, but rather through complex interactions across the in-
stitutions of the welfare state (Beckfield et al., 2015). There is even
greater complexity when considering marginalized patients, who are
more likely to be excluded from traditional healthcare settings (Kcomt,
2019). Within trans communities, these exclusions can lead to illicit
prescribing and ‘do-it-yourself’ (DIY) treatments which fall outside
formal healthcare provision (Scheim et al., 2022). Simultaneously, the
discrimination faced by trans communities leads to cumulative forms of
disadvantage which damage health (Winter et al., 2016). Interventions
which respond to these disadvantages, such as those which tackle
poverty and homelessness, would typically be seen as welfare rather
than health programs, even though they have the potential to signifi-
cantly influence trans health and well-being.
In this study, we limit our focus to services which provide gender-
affirming care, rather than which benefit the health of trans people
more broadly. We do this to create a sharp distinction between trans-
specific healthcare provision and overall healthcare and welfare provi-
sion within a country. While recognizing that such a distinction is a
simplification, this allows us to examine the operation of trans-specific
healthcare systems somewhat independently from overall healthcare
systems, due to the distinctive political, social, economic and institu-
tional forces which shape gender-affirming care. We exclude DIY and
illicit treatments from consideration, viewing these as largely a conse-
quence of poor quality, incompetence, or inaccessibility of formal trans-
specific healthcare services (Scheim et al., 2022). Ideally our study
would include explicit indicators of trans-specific healthcare financing,
however, there is a lack of internationally comparable data on
trans-specific healthcare expenditure.
1.4. Study aims and approach
Using a deductive approach, we aim to develop a novel typology of
trans-specific healthcare systems in Europe and to examine country-
level correlates which may influence or be influenced by these sys-
tems. Following previous literature (e.g., Reibling, 2010; Wendt et al.,
2009), our typology is based on measurements of provision, regulation
and access.
a) Provision refers to the volume and variety of healthcare services that
are being provided and the organizational structures that are used to
deliver these (Wendt, 2009). We therefore consider the availability
of a range of trans health treatments in each country and whether the
delivery setting of treatments is centralized or decentralized
(reflecting both the likely degree of coordination between multidis-
ciplinary providers, and the choice afforded to patients over where
they seek care).
b) Regulation can be defined as the relations between financing
agencies, service providers and (potential) beneficiaries which
govern healthcare provision and access (Wendt et al., 2009, p. 80).
However, this definition can only meaningfully apply in the context
of developed healthcare systems, as it assumes that some degree of
healthcare requiring regulation is available, and that the regulation
of this provision has been deemed politically and socially necessary.
Neither of these assumptions hold in the context of trans healthcare
systems (Scheim et al., 2022). We therefore use a broader definition
of regulation, as the existence of any national-level policies regu-
lating trans healthcare provision, for instance by prohibiting
discrimination on grounds of gender identity or banning conversion
therapy.
c) Access includes the supply of medical services and the types of
gatekeeping which determine who can use them (Reibling, 2010). As
in other typologies of healthcare systems, we assess supply by
including the range of healthcare provision (Reibling, 2010; Wendt,
2009). We incorporate access by considering whether recipients of
trans healthcare require a clinical diagnosis.
Although we are unable to include financing, this dimension is
addressed to some extent in a subsequent analysis which compares total
healthcare expenditure and out-of-pocket spending between the iden-
tified clusters. This subsequent analysis includes variables reflecting
country level correlates that may influence or be influenced by trans-
specific healthcare systems, based on prior literature. These variables
can be broadly classified into the following four factors.
1) The socio-political climate, to examine if and how political and public
polarization around trans rights shapes trans-specific healthcare.
2) Medical outcomes that reflect how, where, and when trans patients
receive treatment. We focus on these more systemic outcomes due to
a lack of comparable international data on traditional outcomes for
trans patients, such as quality of life (Kamran et al., 2023).
3) Characteristics of the general healthcare system, to test whether these
influence the form taken by trans-specific healthcare. This includes
total healthcare expenditure and out-of-pocket spending on health.
4) Other country-level factors such as gross domestic product (GDP) as
well as gender and income inequality.
2. Methods
We utilized a data-driven approach to group European countries
based on indicators of provision, regulation and access to trans health-
care. Our cluster analysis utilizes a range of publicly available secondary
data sources supplemented by coding completed by the research team.
Countries included in the analysis were the 27 EU countries and the UK.
2.1. Positionality
The research team consisted of five members from diverse back-
grounds, including trans and non-binary members (with experience of
navigating trans healthcare systems in Europe and the United States) as
well as cisgender and queer researchers (with experience working in
trans healthcare provision). Disciplinary backgrounds also varied,
including human geography and sociology as well as medical and social
psychology. By definition, these divergent positionalities – and our

professionally and personally – informed all aspects of the research
design and execution (Rose, 1997). The differences between us led to
productive discussions throughout the research process but there were
also crucial similarities: most significantly, our location as academics
within a research-intensive institution located in Western Europe
(Valentine, 2003).
2.2. Measures
We computed four variables to reflect the provision and regulation of
as well as access to trans-specific healthcare in European countries.
These were: (1) treatment supply; (2) access to puberty blockers; (3)
delivery setting and (4) policy. A visualization of the variables for each
country is available in Supplementary File S1. We included all four of
these variables in our cluster analysis. We computed a further 12 vari-
ables to reflect factors which may influence or be influenced by trans-
specific healthcare in these countries, which are tested as outcomes in
our models.
2.2.1. Variables describing trans-specific healthcare systems (i.e., clustering
variables)
Treatment supply. Countries were scored based on the number of
treatments related to trans care offered by either state-funded or state-
run healthcare providers in 2022, using data from TGEU (2022) and
NHS England, 2019, 2023). Each country was scored from 0 to 15 based
on how many of the following treatments were offered: breast
augmentation;
electrolysis;
facial
feminization
surgery;
hormone
replacement therapy (estrogen); hormone replacement therapy (testos-
terone);
hysterectomy;
mastectomy;
metoidioplasty;
orchiectomy;
ovariectomy (aka oophorectomy); phalloplasty; puberty blockers;
tracheal shave; vaginoplasty; vocal training. Higher scores indicate
greater availability of trans-specific healthcare expertise within the
country.
Access to puberty blockers. Puberty suppressing treatment is a
primary intervention for adolescents wishing to explore their gender
identity (Scheim et al., 2022). We included this variable to further
distinguish levels of access for trans youth. Based on data from TGEU
(2022) and NHS England (2023), countries were scored from 0 to 2,
where 0 denoted no provision of puberty blockers or access to puberty
blockers from age 18+ only, 1 denoted access to puberty blockers from
age 16–18, and 2 denoted access to puberty blockers under age 16.
Higher scores indicate greater access.
Delivery setting. The delivery setting for trans-specific healthcare
was classified based on data from Koehler et al. (2021), and a grey
literature search conducted by EK, NM and AB (see Supplementary File
S1). Countries were rated on a scale from 1 to 3, where 1 denoted a
relatively decentralized setting (i.e., provision of transition-related and
gender-affirming medical treatments in different medical institutions); 2
denoted a relatively mixed setting (i.e., a system containing elements of
both centralized and decentralized care); and 3 denoted a relatively
centralized setting (i.e., one interdisciplinary institution that provides all
relevant transition related health care in one location). Higher scores on
this variable reflect higher centralization.
Policy. This variable reflects the presence of health-related policies
which influence access to gender-affirming care and aim to protect the
rights of trans individuals in the context of healthcare. Using data from
TGEU (2022, 2023), countries were scored 0–5 by counting how many of
the following 5 policies were present: an equality action plan that
explicitly includes gender identity (i.e. a national-level plan which in-
cludes the allocation of financial or human resources); legislation to
prohibit discrimination against trans individuals within healthcare;
legislation to prohibit reparative or conversion therapy practiced
against trans people; no requirement for a clinical diagnosis to access
gender-affirming hormones or surgery (scored as 1 if no diagnosis is
required); and full depathologization (scored as 1 if all of the following
criteria are met: national clinical classification standards contain no
mental health diagnosis relating to trans identities;
access and
cost-coverage for trans-specific healthcare is possible without clinical
diagnosis; access and cost-coverage for support services for pre-pubertal
children is possible without clinical diagnosis). Higher scores reflect
higher policy support for trans people and greater facilitation of access
to trans-specific healthcare.
Further information on the data sourcing and coding of the cluster
variables is available in Supplementary Table S2.1.
2.2.2. Country-level correlates of trans-specific healthcare systems
The 12 variables reflecting factors influencing or influenced by trans-
specific healthcare are summarized in Table 1. Further information on
the data sourcing and coding of these variables is available in Supple-
mentary Tables S2.2 and S2.3.
2.3. Analyses
Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics 28 and R
Version 4.1.1. We performed a hierarchical cluster analysis to determine
possible cluster numbers, and a k-means cluster analysis to group
countries according to features of their trans-specific healthcare sys-
tems. These analyses utilized four variables measuring provision, regu-
lation, and access (treatment supply; access to puberty blockers; delivery
setting; policy). Following this, we compared the 12 country-level cor-
relates of trans-specific healthcare between clusters.
We z-scored variables included in the cluster analysis as there was
variability in the scales used to characterize trans-specific healthcare
systems. Without standardization, scores from wider scales would have
had greater pull on the clustering of data. A hierarchical cluster analysis
using squared Euclidean distance and Ward’s linkage method was con-
ducted to explore potential cluster numbers. This was explored via vi-
sual
investigation
of
the
resulting
dendrogram
(Supplementary
Figure S2.1). Internal clustering validation indices were also calculated
in R using the cclust package (Dimitriadou et al., 2002). These cluster
validation techniques alongside practical considerations, such as
choosing a number of clusters which allow nuanced differentiation be-
tween groups, were used to triangulate an appropriate number of clus-
ters. Subsequently, we performed a k-means cluster analysis, using the
predefined number of clusters to groups cases iteratively.
To compare outcomes between clusters, we used one-way ANOVAs
along with follow-up post-hoc tests with Fisher’s least significant dif-
ference adjustment for multiple comparisons as well as chi-square tests
followed up with contingency table analysis using Bonferonni adjust-
ment for binary variables (Beasley and Schumacker, 1995). Although we
refer to these as correlates (due to the fact that some of these variables
may be drivers of differences in trans-specific healthcare systems while
others are a product of these different types of systems), these were all
entered as outcomes in the specified models.

3.1. Descriptives
Table 2 shows the means, standard deviations (SDs) and minimum
and maximum values of the four variables describing trans-specific
healthcare that were inputted into the K-means cluster analysis and
the 12 variables describing country-level correlates. A Pearson’s corre-
lations matrix with all variables included is available in Supplementary
Table S2.4.
3.2. Cluster analysis
From our dendrogram (Supplementary Figure S2.1) we identified
that two or four clusters would be potentially appropriate structures to
represent the dataset. We ran a k-means cluster analysis with cluster
solutions ranging from two to five potential clusters. Thirteen cluster

validation indices were computed using the cclust package in R
(Supplementary Table S2.5). A visual example of two of these indices
across the four cluster solutions is presented in Fig. 1. Previous assess-
ments of clustering indices suggest that the technique developed by
Cali´
nski and Harabasz (1974) is optimal for continuous data (Milligan
and Cooper, 1985), with examination of additional indices adding
converging evidence. While the Cali´

distinct
they
are.

score indicates a better-defined clustering solution. Given that the
cluster validation measures suggested that a four-cluster solution had
adequate performance and a two-cluster solution led to country
grouping being determined heavily by an Eastern vs. Western European
split, which we considered not particularly informative for elaborating
upon the nature of trans-specific healthcare, we chose a four-cluster
solution to best represent the data.
Final cluster composition along with the means and SDs of each
cluster variable are displayed in Table 3, while scores for individual
countries can be found in Supplementary File S1. A visual representation
of each country’s squared Euclidean distance from its cluster centroid
collapsed across the two most distinct dimensions of space generated
using the fviz_cluster command in the factoextra package in R (Kas-
sambara and Mundt, 2020) is shown in Fig. 2. A box-and-whisker plot
and a scatter plot of these distances can be seen in Supplementary
Figures S2.2 and S2.3.
All four clustering variables were largely well explained by the
clustering solution selected. Treatment supply (R2 = 0.88) was the
variable best explained, followed by delivery setting (R2 = 0.73), policy
(R2 = 0.62), and access to puberty blockers (R2 = 0.60).
Cluster 1. This cluster consists of Belgium, the Netherlands,
Portugal, Italy, and the UK (in order from closest to furthest from the
cluster centroid, with those closest to the centroid representing coun-
tries most prototypical of the cluster). These countries are characterized
by their highly centralized systems for delivering trans-specific health-
care (M = 3.00, SD = 0.00). They also share high levels of treatment
supply (M = 12.20, SD = 1.11) and typically access to puberty sup-
pressing treatment under the age of 16 (M = 1.80, SD = 0.45), with the
exception of the UK. However, these countries have among the lowest
levels of trans-specific policy influencing healthcare (M = 0.60, SD =
0.55).
Cluster 2. This cluster consists of Denmark, France, Spain, Sweden,
Germany, Finland, and Malta (in order from closest to furthest from the
cluster centroid). The countries in this cluster offer the highest number
of treatments (M = 12.86, SD = 1.10) with relatively widespread access
to puberty suppressing treatment under the age of 16 (M = 1.71, SD =
0.49). Like those in Cluster 1, these countries operate predominantly
through centralized settings of care delivery (M = 2.71, SD = 0.49), with
only Germany and Spain classified as mixed-delivery settings. Unlike
Cluster 1, however, these countries have high levels of trans-specific
policy influencing healthcare (M = 2.43, SD = 0.53).
Cluster 3. This cluster is the smallest, comprising only Slovenia,
Czech Republic, Austria, and Luxembourg (in order from closest to
furthest from the cluster centroid). These countries are similar in their
relatively high supply of gender-affirming treatments (M = 11.25, SD =
0.96) through a predominantly decentralized care setting (M = 1.25, SD
= 0.50), in contrast to countries in Clusters 1 and 2 (only Slovenia offers
a mixed-delivery setting). These countries generally allow puberty
suppression over the age of 16 (M = 1.25, SD = 0.96), although
Luxembourg offers no access. There are also few trans-specific policies
influencing healthcare (M = 1.00, SD = 0.82).
Cluster 4. This cluster consists of Croatia, Hungary, Bulgaria,
Slovakia, Romania, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Greece, Ireland,
and Cyprus (in order from closest to furthest from the cluster centroid).
These countries offer a very low supply of gender-affirming treatments
(M = 2.75, SD = 2.22) including little or no access to puberty sup-
pressing treatments (M = 0.25, SD = 0.62), and any care is offered
mainly through decentralized systems (M = 1.25, SD = 0.62). These
countries are also characterized by either providing limited or no trans-
specific policy influencing healthcare (M = 0.67, SD = 0.65).
3.3. Comparisons between clusters
The mean and SD of each variable, along with results of one-way
ANOVAs and chi square tests for country-level correlates of trans-
specific healthcare systems are shown in Table 4. Where a statistically
significant difference was found between clusters, the post-hoc result is
also detailed in Table 4.
Socio-political climate. There were statistically significant differ-
ences in public attitudes, (F (3,24) = 8.764, p < 0.001) and gender
identity concealment (F(3,24) = 12.691, p < 0.01, and a marginal dif-
ference in self-determination between clusters (Х2(3) = 6.288, p < 0.1).
For public attitudes and gender identity concealment, post-hoc tests
revealed that countries in Cluster 4 had the lowest levels of public
support for trans people (M = 0.45, SD = 0.14) and the highest levels of
gender identity concealment by trans people (M = 0.55, SD = 0.04),
reflecting high levels of public stigma for trans people on average in
these countries. Contingency table analysis did not reveal statistically
significant differences between clusters for self-determination.
Medical outcomes. There were statistically significant differences
in medical interventions (F (3,24) = 6.055, p < 0.05) and marginal
differences in waiting times between clusters (F(3,24) = 6.055, p < 0.1).
According to post-hoc tests, trans people were most likely to have
accessed medical interventions in countries in Cluster 3 (M = 41.00, SD
= 5.60), with levels significantly higher than those in Clusters 2 (M =
18.43, SD = 8.81) and 4 (M = 20.00, SD = 11.44), although not

significantly different than those in Cluster 1. While the difference did
not reach statistical significance in the overall ANOVA (p = 0.072), post-
hoc tests revealed that waiting times were significantly higher in Cluster
1 (M = 21.9, SD = 15.72) than Clusters 3 (M = 5.62, SD = 2.25) and 4
(M = 9.98, SD = 14.90), with Cluster 2 (M = 9.00, SD = 6.93) falling
indistinguishably between. There were not statistically significant dif-
ferences between clusters for seeking treatment abroad.
General healthcare system. There were not statistically significant
differences in out-of-pocket expenditure or GP-to-specialist ratios be-
tween the clusters. However, we did find a significant difference in
overall health expenditure (F (3,24) = 4.743, p < 0.05), with post-hoc
tests showing that countries in Cluster 4 spend the least on healthcare
overall (M = 1748.28, SD = 1428.76) at levels significantly lower than
all other clusters.
Other country-level indicators. We did find evidence of differences
in gender inequality between clusters (F (3,24) = 5.707, p < 0.05).
Specifically, in parallel to differences in socio-political climate for trans
people, post-hoc tests revealed that countries in Cluster 4 had the
highest levels of gender inequality (M = 0.12, SD = 0.04), significantly
higher than all other clusters. There were not statistically significant
differences in overall GDP or income inequality between clusters.
4. Discussion
4.1. A typology of trans-specific healthcare systems
Where existing comparative healthcare systems research focuses on
what are implicitly assumed to be ‘typical’ health services most relevant
to the general population, this study reveals the limitations of such an
approach. By focusing on health services specific to trans people, our
analysis reveals clusters of trans-specific healthcare systems that diverge
significantly from previous typologies (e.g., B¨
ohm et al., 2013; Reibling
et al., 2019; Wendt, 2009). For instance, Wendt (2009) characterizes
Portugal, Spain, and Finland as low budget – restricted access systems,
where the availability of healthcare services is constrained. In our ty-
pology, these countries offered among the most extensive ranges of
trans-specific health treatments. Similarly, Reibling et al. (2019) classify
Belgium, France and Germany as supply-and choice- oriented public sys-
tems, in which access to services is relatively unregulated and citizens
enjoy a high degree of choice among providers. However, access to trans
healthcare in these countries is either somewhat or highly centralized,
suggesting greater regulation of access (Koehler et al., 2021). Moreover,
Reibling et al. (2019) find that supply and choice-oriented countries offer a
relatively high volume of general healthcare provision. Yet the
remaining countries within this category (Austria, Czech Republic,
Ireland, Luxembourg, Slovenia) offer a relatively lower range of
trans-specific treatments. Taken together, these findings suggest that
trans-specific healthcare systems represent an ‘example of internal
welfare state inconsistency’ (Bambra, 2005b, p. 196). Organizational
principles and institutional forms can vary widely in different parts of
the welfare state within a single country (Bambra, 2005b). In this case,
the structure of the general healthcare system does not seem to deter-
mine the structure of trans-specific healthcare provision.
Our analysis allows us to describe four novel types of trans-specific
healthcare systems emergent across Europe, as distinct from existing
typologies. A map displaying our types alongside the cluster numbers is
shown in Fig. 3. We characterize cluster 1 (e.g., Belgium and the
Netherlands) as centralized conservative trans-specific healthcare systems.
With treatment available in a smaller number of specialist clinics, they
offer a comprehensive array of treatments suggesting a high level of
expertise. This may result from the concentration of clinical specialists
and academic researchers within a few centers, or it could reflect greater
lobbying power leading to increased funding allocations (Gelijns and
Thier, 2002). We describe them as conservative as there are relatively
few government policies shaping provision and clinical diagnoses tend
to remain a requirement for receiving treatment. These systems

therefore preserve traditional medical authority over gender-affirming
care. While differences in waiting times did not achieve statistical sig-
nificance in our primary analyses, the presence of longer waiting times
in centralized conservative systems could imply that a higher level of
medical gatekeeping slows access to treatment, at least in terms of initial
assessments. This is supported by a statistically significant positive
correlation between delivery setting (i.e., higher centralization) and
waiting times within our dataset (Supplementary Table S2.4).
Cluster 2 (e.g., Denmark and France) can be described as centralized
reformist trans-specific healthcare systems. These share many features with
centralized conservative-types, including centralized treatment settings
and a comprehensive array of treatments. However, these systems are
subject to the greatest number of central or regional government pol-
icies. These can intervene directly in medical practice, either by
regulating the types of treatment that can be offered (e.g., banning
conversion therapy) or by mandating depathologization; most often
they are general policies such as equality action plans for trans people.
We therefore describe these systems as reformist, as medical authority is
modulated by state intervention in trans-specific healthcare.
Our first two clusters overlap somewhat with the typology proposed
by Reibling et al. (2019), who identified eight EU countries where access
to specialist healthcare provision is tightly gatekept (Denmark, Finland,
Italy, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, UK). In our typology, all
these countries are located within one of our centralized clusters, where
access to trans-specific healthcare is also gatekept. This suggests that
trans-specific healthcare may share some path dependencies with
overall healthcare systems, even amid overall divergences.

decentralized marketized trans-specific healthcare systems. Within these
systems, gender-affirming treatments are offered by independent pro-
viders with multiple different routes and conditions of access (Koehler
et al., 2021). We characterize them as marketized because of their
non-monopolistic approach to the provision of gender-affirming care,
which takes place outside specialized centers. Instead, the types and
varieties of treatment on offer depend on competition between providers
and on the choices of patients (Krachler et al., 2021). Decentralized
marketized systems offer a lower number of treatments than the pre-
ceding two types. This suggests that decentralization may reduce the
range of gender-affirming procedures available, perhaps by inhibiting
coordination of multidisciplinary care. There are also relatively few
governmental policies targeting trans-specific healthcare within these
systems, implying a laissez faire approach to provision. At the same
time, patients in these systems report higher uptake of treatment, sug-
gesting that access to care is greater. This could reflect the diversity of
providers and greater choice available through marketization. However,
reduced coordination of services (and lack of some specific services, e.g.,
advanced surgical care) may negatively affect the quality of care and the
continuity of treatment pathways compared to more centralized
systems.
Cluster 4 (e.g., Croatia and Hungary) can be described as underde-
veloped trans-specific healthcare systems. These systems offer the lowest
range of gender-affirming treatments, which are generally limited to the
provision of hormones rather than any surgical procedures. Underde-
veloped systems are highly decentralized; however, this is likely to
reflect a lack of services rather than an active approach to healthcare
provisioning. Few or no policies address trans healthcare, suggesting
that trans rights remain low on the political agenda and relatively un-
supported by the wider public (Flores, 2015). We characterize these
systems as underdeveloped since there is little evidence of a systematic
approach to trans healthcare within either the policy arena or the
healthcare system.
Socio-political climates appear to play a significant role in under-
developed systems, where trans rights have the lowest level of support
among the public and gender identity concealment among trans people
is the highest. This suggests a context where trans people face high levels
of structural stigma, which could prevent the development of cohesive
gender-affirming healthcare services (Falck and Branstrom, 2023).
Without public and political support, trans healthcare services are un-

the likelihood that trans people will seek out or attend services, further
weakening the financial case for funding. These countries also fare the
worst in terms of equal rights for women. This supports theories within
feminist and trans literature that posit a relationship between patriar-
chal oppression of women and anti-trans stigma (Pearce, 2018). Finally,
total health expenditure is also significantly lower in underdeveloped
systems. This would seem to endorse R¨
omer’s (2017) conclusion that
overall levels of welfare provision are positively correlated to the gen-
erosity of provision for social ‘outsiders’ (in R¨
omer’s study, immigrant
groups). In this case, the underdevelopment of healthcare for trans
people as a marginalized social group is related to lower overall
expenditure across the health system. This finding should also put to rest
any notion that trans-specific healthcare systems will straightforwardly
evolve towards ever-higher levels of expertise and provision. Instead,
increasing levels of structural stigma in some countries with historically
well-developed trans-specific healthcare (e.g. the UK; Smith, 2022) may
well lead to rolling-back or restriction of such services and regression of
the healthcare system (Kraschel et al., 2022).
4.2. Limitations and future directions
Our analysis and novel classification of trans-specific healthcare
systems in the EU provides important insights into the status of trans
healthcare in Europe during this historically fraught moment. Recent
years have seen enormous levels of polarization over approaches to
healthcare for trans people across countries. Treatment for children and
adolescents has been at the forefront of this debate, with access to
puberty-blocking medications proving among the most contentious is-
sues in trans-specific healthcare (Horton, 2023). In our typology,
puberty-blocking medication was rarely available in countries with
underdeveloped trans-specific healthcare systems, but generally avail-
able in centralized conservative, centralized reformist and decentralized
marketized systems. However, levels of access varied substantially.
Countries with decentralized marketized systems imposed greater re-
strictions than those with centralized conservative or centralized
reformist systems (and those with underdeveloped systems imposed the
greatest restrictions). Importantly, however, countries with centralized
conservative or centralized reformist systems, such as Sweden, Finland,
and the United Kingdom, have also recently introduced policies
restricting access to puberty blockers. Therefore, the typology we have
observed here may already be in flux, with countries moving between
clusters as political controversies play out against a backdrop of virulent
lobbying against professional standards of care. Reanalysis in a few
years may result in a very different landscape of trans-specific health-
care across the EU.
The large and relatively uniform proportion of variance in our
clustering variables explained by the final cluster solution suggests that
the variability of all four of our measures (treatment supply; access to
puberty blockers; delivery setting; policy) is reasonably well captured.
This implies that all four of these dimensions of trans-specific healthcare
should be included in future studies. Nonetheless, we were somewhat
limited in our scope by a relative lack of comparative international data
reflecting intricacies of different trans-specific healthcare systems.
Within our measurement of treatment supply, we assumed that the
number of procedures available through government-funded healthcare
services was an adequate proxy for overall levels of trans healthcare
provision. Additional work on this topic could consider the quantities of
different services, the number of specialists, and the number of pro-
cedures carried out (Reibling et al., 2019). We were also unable to
include data on trans-specific healthcare expenditure, nor could we
calculate any of our measures in per capita terms due to a lack of
comparative data on trans populations in different European countries.
In terms of regulation, our cluster analysis included central government
policies affecting trans-specific healthcare systems. This does not cap-
ture a potentially crucial dimension of regulation, which is the rela-
tionship between funder and provider institutions (Wendt et al., 2009).
Many European healthcare systems utilize insurance models which
require different forms of co-payment for trans-specific healthcare
(TGEU, 2022). This can reflect different institutional formations as well
as conditions of access to treatment (Reibling, 2010) and should
certainly be included in future work. Furthermore, our analysis included
variables which measured the number of available treatments and the
presence or absence of regulations which limited medical gatekeeping,
but could not capture actual rates of uptake or utilization. Meanwhile,
we assessed the presence or absence of certain policies in our analysis,
but policy enactment is highly dependent on institutional practices and
the discretion of bureaucrats (Kiely and Warnock, 2023). Furthermore,
there remains a significant need for international comparative research
which measures different dimensions of trans-specific healthcare along
with disparities in healthcare across Europe and beyond (e.g., in the
Global South). This links to a further need for research that includes
other intersecting dimensions of marginalization. While our analysis
included a measure of gender inequality, it is vital for future compara-
tive research to consider how inequalities of race, class, sexuality and
disability shape and are shaped by the organization and provision of
trans-specific healthcare.
5. Conclusion
This study demonstrates the utility of comparative research into
healthcare systems which focuses on specific groups within populations
(e.g., trans people). Through a data-driven analysis of publicly available
secondary data, we demonstrate that trans-specific healthcare often
diverges significantly from overall patterns of health and welfare pro-
vision. Our research provides important and nuanced insights into po-
tential drivers and outcomes of distinct types of trans-specific healthcare
systems across European countries. Results from comparative studies,
such as ours, can inform best practice at multiple scales. Simultaneously,
the question of what constitutes an optimal trans-specific healthcare
system remains complex: With provision rationed, diagnoses remain
necessary to ensure access to publicly funded or reimbursable treatment,
yet this undermines choice and autonomy for trans people; centraliza-
tion of care leads to longer waiting times but also more coordinated and
specialized treatment options; government intervention sometimes im-
proves trans healthcare (e.g., through depathologization) but also
sometimes limits it (e.g., through restrictions on puberty suppression).
By thinking comparatively about the social, political and economic
factors which give rise to these contradictions, we hope that work such
as ours can spur campaigns and policies which will systematically tackle
them. Building on long histories of independent trans organizing
(Pearce, 2018), these can promote more comprehensive, accessible and
equitable gender-affirming care, moving towards healthcare systems
which respect the agency and autonomy of trans people (Chiang and
Bachmann, 2023; Riggs et al., 2019).
